There are relatively strong arguments on both sides of this debate. Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101).

That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage.  Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals.

Is anyone investigating this situation? Should it be reported elsewhere? [[User:Peter coxhead|Peter coxhead]] ([[User talk:Peter coxhead|talk]]) 08:28, 12 May 2012 (UTC)  :Many templates will only produce something at the deepest expansion levels in certain circumstances, for example some string templates when the strings happen to have certain lengths (not necessarily the longest), so it's hard to tell from the result whether all templates were completely evaluated. Evaluation will only skip the expansion levels which are too deep. Later code of the template with less expansion can still be evaluated. And the red error message "Expansion depth limit exceeded" is only produced in some circumstances. I guess it happens when whatever could not be expanded was supposed to be rendered. If it's elsewhere like in a condition then there may be no indication beyond the category that the expansion depth was exceeded. Unless somebody can produce an example where manual evaluation of the code indicates that the 40 levels should not have been broken, I will assume the category is generated correctly.

A cladogram with leaf nodes exactly 20 deep renders the deepest node, but generates an expansion depth limit. ::So, if I understand correctly, this means that after outputting the node of depth 20, the software attempts to expand something which would not produce any output (e.g. a #if: expression which would generate an null/empty result).

[[User:Peter coxhead|Peter coxhead]] ([[User talk:Peter coxhead|talk]]) 20:00, 12 May 2012 (UTC)  :::The software doesn't evaluate expansions beyond level 40 so it doesn't know what they would have produced if they had been evaluated. See [[meta:Help:Expansion depth]]. When the 41st expansion should have been made, the software produces <code><nowiki><span class="error">Expansion depth limit exceeded</span></nowiki></code> at that place in the wikisource instead of evaluating the expansion. It gives the same result as if the 41st expansion in the wikisource had been replaced by the code <code><nowiki><span class="error">Expansion depth limit exceeded</span></nowiki></code>. What that result is depends on the context. For example, if the 41st expansion would have been rendered unaltered if it had been text then <code><nowiki><span class="error">Expansion depth limit exceeded</span></nowiki></code> is rendered. This produces <span class="error">Expansion depth limit exceeded</span> with the way the error class is defined. If the 41st expansion is the condition part in an #if then the #if evaluates to true because the produced <code><nowiki><span class="error">Expansion depth limit exceeded</span></nowiki></code> is non-empty.

Meaning, I think it's worth-while for technical people to vet the request while I make sure (on our end) that we're really requesting what we want. ([[User:Anomie|Anomie]] has kindly helped me clarify several details, but of course if this description is incompetent you must blame me!)   ===Background===  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Poetry|WikiProject Poetry]] is reviewing standards for graphically displaying [[scansion]]. Our current best practice uses monospaced characters signaled by line-initial spaces, thus:     ×   /   × /      × /   [/] ×  /    ×  /   ×     /  [/]  There is beyonde the Alps, | a towne of auncient fame <ref>Brooke: ''Romeus and Iuliet'', 1</ref>  But there is some frustration that these lines cannot be better integrated into regular text (e.g. eliminate the box and shading, and allow indentation), while retaining WYSIWYG editing. Line-initial spaces, {{tag|tt|o}}, {{tag|pre|o}}, and {{tag|poem|o}} all provide some, but not all of the necessary functionality. Of all these markups, {{tag|poem|o}} seems to come closest to our requirements, so we take that as the "foundation" of the following discussion.  There seem to be 2 paths which can provide the features we would like to see: <references/> ===Path 1: tweak {{tag|poem|o}} functionality===  {{tag|poem|o}} will do exactly what is needed IF: multiple line-internal spaces can be made to render literally, just as multiple line-initial spaces currently do.  Our full opening code would then be:  <code><nowiki><poem style="font-family:Courier;margin-left:2em"></nowiki></code>  '''Pros''': It could be argued that {{tag|poem|o}} should in principle render line-internal spaces, irrespective of its convenience for scansion: some modernist poems like the first published version of [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]'s "[[In a Station of the Metro]]" implicitly require wide line-internal spaces, and multiple space characters may be easier to handle editorially than e.g. <code><nowiki>{{pad|1em}}</nowiki></code>  <poem style="margin-left:2em;"> The apparition {{pad|1em}} of these faces {{pad|1em}} in the crowd {{pad|1em}}: Petals {{pad|1em}} on a wet, black {{pad|1em}} bough {{pad|1em}} . <ref>Pound: "In a Station of the Metro"</ref> </poem>  '''Cons''': Altering the {{tag|poem|o}} standard could mess up any number of existing implementations which rely on its current formulation. Also since scansion is its own thing, it is probably appropriate for it to have its own markup.  ===Path 2: new markup===  A new markup can be developed... presumably tagged with {{tag|scan|o}} or {{tag|scansion|o}} if these are available. We assume it will be based on {{tag|poem|o}}, but that of course is up to the developer. The requirements would be: #Render as monospaced characters (e.g. Courier) : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports as an optional "style" element. In the new scansion markup, this should be the default #Render multiple line-initial spaces literally : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports #Render multiple line-internal spaces literally : {{tag|poem|o}} currently does '''not''' support #Render single line-breaks literally : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports #Render some possibly-reserved characters literally (these include "|", "/", "\", "[]", "()") : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports #Render markup (e.g. {{tag|ref|o}}) as markup, not literally : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports #Allow the application of a left margin : {{tag|poem|o}} currently supports as an optional "style" element. In the new scansion markup, there might be a default left margin (of, say, 2 em), but it should also be adjustable using "style".  Thanks for your consideration. [[User:Phil wink|Phil wink]] ([[User talk:Phil wink|talk]]) 17:55, 6 May 2012 (UTC) :I can check a database dump and see if any existing <nowiki><poem /></nowiki> instances would be likely to be affected by the first path (they might be affected if they have multiple spaces?).

If you cannot follow this simple psychological pattern on your own, I can explain it for you: some things really irritate people and they are (1) not able to read text on paper or screen (too big or too small), (2) being taken something they liked - the previous way of displaying, (3) too much design sometimes rises stupidity - this is always a must in design "don't go on too much design esp. when not needed", maximum functionality and then maximum design not the ''vice versa'', (4) when they don't understand other editor's changes they think the editors are doing something wrong on the page: that rises arguments.

In contrast, I had regularly seen discussions where users were complaining about the new diff scheme, suggesting that it only be optional, yet the new scheme has been implemented without any way to switch back. No-one is saying MediaWiki development should be stopped; what we are saying is that before large efforts are being spent on new functionality some feedback should be sought from the community.

Most people who use the watchlist will tell you that ften, it's not the article itself which is the most important link appearing. Frequently, it's the editor, or the diff itself. The highlighting of the titles gives totally the wrong emphasis.

For experienced users, who typically have large watchlists and many high-traffic pages on them, there are too many cases where the natural reaction to a watchlist change is something other than visiting the page, making the whole idea of highlighting based on visited status not really useful.

Instead of seeing lots of green stars (the best version so far), have the script find either the last refresh of the watchlist page, or the earliest green-star change, and on ''that'' change line only, add a second (divider) line consisting of a horizontal rule with central text like "last visit 00:00, 00 Mmm 0000 (UTC)". Picking out a ''single'' HR rather than navigating the starfield is much clearer. '''Note''': this applies in spades to the change listing "updated since my last visit" in green prior to every "(undo)" link, which is '''absolutely horrid'''. Looking for the earliest green line when it's not at the beginning or end of the line and looks almost black on a laptop is much much worse than an unobtrusive horizontal rule. (And when I look at the page via choosing a diff link in history rather than visiting the page directly, this "service" guesses wrong anyway, but that wouldn't be such a frustration with an easy-to-find HR). '''Sidenote''': the vast sentiment for "opt-in" does ''not'' mean "opt-in" is the winner, it means the winner is "the UI guys tried too many changes too fast and scared us". If more discussion of technical capability occurs and more users are drawn in, a second straw poll would probably give a different result. The solution is that future major UI changes should get a dismissible announcement note where users can comment "hate it" during the trial period until people stop hating it. I hated italicized titles for a long time until I realized my concerns were illusory. [[User:John J.

I cannot imagine how that could ''not'' be good functionality. As for the styling, that has yet to be decided, but there is absolutely no reason to have it disabled in any way, just becuase of a conservative mindset. If everything new is made opt-in, the preferences section is going to be too overwhelming to new users. That is something we absolutely do not want. The feature is there based on earlier consensus. It was also decided the styling was to be discussed at a later date. Right now, all the nay-sayers want it disabled or made opt-in ''purely'' based on what it ''looks'' like, while not a single comment has been made on the ''functionality'', so those comments are likely to be discarded pre-emtively.  So, let's be really constructive and decide how we want changes to be visualized, because there is one thing I can guarantee you: configuration options that have been enabled by default on this (or other) project(s) can and will ''never'' be opt-in. <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:Edokter|<span style="color:#008"><i>E</i>dokter</span>]] ([[User talk:Edokter|<span style="color:#080">talk</span>]]) — </span> 08:04, 13 May 2012 (UTC)  ::'''Re "Right now, all the nay-sayers want it disabled or made opt-in ''purely'' based on what it ''looks'' like, while not a single comment has been made on the ''functionality'', so those comments are likely to be discarded pre-emtively.": Aesthetics and functionality are inseparable in this case.

That's the overwhelming part. It's very similar to an e-mail inbox that you simply can't ever get ahead of. Not on a project as active as this one, at least. Meta-Wiki is manageable. :::: The underlining is vastly less awful. It gives a cue without punching the user in the face. I think it would make sense to use the bold for users with smaller watchlists and something less awful for users with larger watchlists. This could be accomplished through a user preference, implicit controls (less than 1,000 items, bold, etc.), or some other means. :::: That said, this is actively causing a problem for established users, so it should be a fairly high priority to make the site less awful for them. When you have the chief tech guy at Wikimedia posting hacks to make the site less awful, you really question the default, at least as a default for everyone using the site.

It makes sense to keep it displayed prominently here; also for the reason that developers etc. need to be reminded of what people's current concerns are, and it's harder for them to ignore a big discussion at VPT than a subpage or some new WP: space page made just for it that ''no one'' is watching yet.

As much as a negative reaction could've been expected, not every negative reaction is merely par for the course and should be brushed off as such. This one was more warranted due to the flawed development cycle it resulted from. Firstly, the change wasn't discussed (or was barely) -- and even though that usually isn't something users of a site are brought in on, it is something that '''has to''' happen here; the developers are not supposed to have the power to decide on changes merely due to their technical ability to implement them. The change was also not tested on a pool of this project's audience in beta fashion, and was instead tested live, where it was also rapidly tweaked several times, again with no testing. This rollback isn't a judgment of the feature or a mere reaction to outcry, but I would say in part it's a demonstration of the fact that Wikipedia is not Facebook. We're a community that discusses and decides on interface changes ourselves, rather than having them thrust upon us. When a more proper discussion and test occurs, or it is simply provided as an extra opt-in feature (or at the very ''least'' an opt-out, as even ''that'' wasn't provided), a less contentious rollout of this feature (or one like it) can then occur.

[[User:Elen of the Roads|Elen of the Roads]] ([[User talk:Elen of the Roads|talk]]) 19:24, 12 May 2012 (UTC) :::Actually, that's only one part of the issue.  Fact is that many users are not technically comfortable in using all these scripts (and since they're on individual user pages, it is impossible to ensure that they are all updated properly - which is a major problem). As well, even if people are comfortable in using them, they may have technical reasons why they are suboptimal. I've wound up disabling almost every script I ever put into my .css because it did not function properly due to some interaction with (a) other scripts or (b) something in a mandatory hardware or software setting.  Gadgets work okay, most of the time.  So they should either be gadgets (which are usually maintained and kept compatible with upgrades), or standard.  <p>In the case of this particular change, I believe that the main reason there are so many complaints is that so many of the editors on this project are using skins other than Vector - in fact, I think I saw a stat somewhere that said over 70% of users who were editing pre-Vector continue to use Monobook or some other skin. This change looks fantastic in Vector, but is less pleasant on Monobook (the bolding goes beyond making the entries stand out, and can make it difficult to pick out the unbolded entries). Probably what needed to be done here was tweaking of the non-Vector skins - I note there isn't much discussion of what skin/OS/browser was being used that might relate to this issue.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 15:41, 13 May 2012 (UTC) ::::Good point about different skins. Each skin can of course have its own sitewide default. I did suggest over in The Other Place This Discussion Is Also Happening (For No Obvious Reason) that we make a gadget to apply the styling, so everyone can do what they want, and then collect stats on user choices to inform the default. If we did that we should be able to collect data split by skin, so different skins can have different defaults. On the other hand, if we do Elen's survey, that's a ''lot'' of screenshots (different options for different skins)... [[User:Rd232|Rd232]] <sup>[[user talk:rd232|talk]]</sup> 16:45, 13 May 2012 (UTC) :::: Good point. Should add that to the survey. I use modern, and it looked bloody awful - exactly the same as Truthkeeper's description of a migraine attack.

After [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moose_Bay,_Saskatchewan&diff=493307959&oldid=369591721 I fixed it], I decided to see get an idea of how many ''other'' hamlets have this problem, in case it was a small enough number that I could reasonably fix them all.  Well, according to "What links here", there are approximately 4,500 pages that link to ''[[Hamlet]]''. At least 300 of these appear to be pages for places, half of them in the province of Saskatchewan and half in various other states, provinces, and countries.  I therefore suggest that practically all of these are talking about hamlets and not ''Hamlet''.  But 300+ pages is too many to conveniently fix by hand.  So I had another idea: links intending to point to the play will almost certainly spell it '''<code><nowiki>[[Hamlet]]</nowiki></code>''', whereas those intending to talk about a hamlet will almost certainly spell it '''<code><nowiki>[[hamlet]]</nowiki></code>'''.  Therefore if someone would please write a bot to scan through all links to ''[[Hamlet]]'', find the ones spelled <code><nowiki>[[hamlet]]</nowiki></code>, and just change those into <code><nowiki>[[hamlet (place)|]]</nowiki></code>, it might introduce a few errors but I'm sure it would be a big improvement on the current situation.  Whether this bot should be a once-only thing or whether it should run regularly in case someone generates a bunch more pages about hamlets in some state, province, or country is a decision I'll happily leave to others.  Likewise the question of what degree of human checking is appropriate, and of whether there are any other words/names that need similar treatment.  But I do say that it should be written and should be run once on "Hamlet", anyway.  --[[Special:Contributions/76.69.138.214|76.69.138.214]] ([[User talk:76.69.138.214|talk]]) 08:09, 19 May 2012 (UTC) :I've started to go through the pages manually - most of them are fairly easy to spot so I haven't had to look at each and every article.

I am also having major problems on the new mobile site on my Android phone that mirror these and make it nearly unusable. It worked fine before!!   ---- The new Wikipedia mobile website is really bad. It has many problems when viewed on Android mobiles: If you scrolll down while the page is loading, it scrolls back up to the beginning after page loads, unexpectedly. Why does it forcefully scroll the page when the user didn't request it? The arrow button (in each section for "Show more content") is hard to press, because it's too small. The previous version had a proper "Show" button which was bigger. Sometimes the full content doesn't appear when you press the arrow button. It might show only the first half of a paragraph, for example. When you use the arrow button a few times, it's virtually impossible to escape out of the page with the Back button. You have to press it so many times, and it's difficult to tell what's going on. Using an arrow button is not good for usability anyway, because you can't tell what it's supposed to do. The link "Jump back a section" usually does nothing. Please could someone revert it back to the old mobile version ASAP, which didn't have any of these problems. ----  Adding to this: when you press the arrow or text to expand a section, it takes forever to open. You aren't sure if anything is happening, so often you will press it again, only to have it quickly open and then re-close because the re-close operation registers nearly immediately.   Really, it's terrible.

The main ideas seem to be that it only works with formats like "25-12-1987", "25-12-87", "25 Dec 87", or "25 DEC 1987". All it does is create a character string by moving various characters around. Plus, if the year is only two digits, it interprets everything below 50 as in the 2000's and everything above 50 as in the 1900's. So the examples I gave would be transformed to "19871225", "19871225", "1987De25", and "1987DE25". Then the resulting character strings would be sorted.  So all the dates in the table must be consistent within the table. Further, of the 4 formats allowed by MOS, three don't work. Of the 6 formats allowed by this function, 4 are forbidden by MOS.

Which is one of the reasons I very much dislike this re-ordered construction, entirely. To make tabbed browsing easier, We normally use a reversed breadcrumb in the page title (Action < Page name < Site name). Up until now that was the case for all actions and special pages. But this is now broken for Diff and History. For example, right now I see tabs "Editing User:Kr..", "My Watchlist - W..", "Wikipedia:Villag..", "Wikipedia:Villag.." and "Wikipedia:Villag..". I can't tell which of these last three is view, Diff or History. Now one could make a similar point when saying you have tabs "Difference ..", "Difference .." and "Difference ..". So I doubt there is really much of a gain for either. But whatever the case, consistency throughout the interface is most important. And right now these "Diff" and "History" are inconsistent with all other titles, because those titles (Edit, Move, Delete, View source, What links here, ...) all put the action first and quote the page title (which has so far always prevented most confusion about which part the page name is).

However, as someone who participates at VP Proposals and basically always has, I'd just like to point out that the developers would probably find themselves getting better responses if they worked on changes the community has been requesting. Realizing full-well that they're mostly volunteers and can spend their time the way they like, I think a better job could be done in encouraging development of what the community wants, rather than their own whims regarding what is best ''for'' the community. They've become a little too comfortable with the latter over the years for my taste, and it would appear I'm not alone in feeling that. Most rights-wielding users have been more-or-less trained to be sensitive to the fact that their privileges are only there to serve the community's decisions. I feel this much less from developers. Perhaps it's a disconnect that started with the use of bugzilla, a forum outside of Wikipedia, where development business is discussed outside the purview of the average user (even most non-average users). The argument could be made that that's a good thing, and certainly that bugzilla's features are more conducive to development talk. I just don't know if keeping things status-quo is worth risking the kind of breakdown Happy-Melon describes, which does seem plausible.

Why not attempt to address this issue in a way that has a chance of improving it? I'm open to suggestions, but considering there is an incongruence between MediaWiki's development as standalone software vs. its effects on a website purported to be run by a very large community whose interests may differ, I think discussing a policy governing the way MediaWiki changes affects Wikipedia could be a good start.

Then they recoil in horror when "the community" rejects the change loudly the moment such change 'goes live'. I'm not suggesting the everything needs to have the same degree of community approval, nor that I am unhappy about the subject of this particular discussion.

Not only do we have to make sure that our software works in 200+ languages (including right-to-left), but we also have to make sure that it works in all the ancient MediaWiki skins, that it supports all 3 versions of the editing interface (old, older, and oldest), that if the user disables any dependencies or JavaScript it degrades gracefully, and we even have community members demanding that all features work in text-only browsers. Frankly, it's a miracle that any changes to MediaWiki ever actually get deployed. And for the record, we try really hard to get community feedback before changes are deployed (with some notable failures). Most of the development teams do weekly IRC office hours, and spend a huge amount of time responding to bugzilla threads, listserv threads, and on-wiki threads discussing ideas for features. And we devote special attention to English Wikipedia in particular: frequently advertising projects on the Signpost and Village pumps. And that's just what we do publicly. We spend inordinate amounts of time discussing community feedback and potential community reaction to features in development meetings, often skyping or IRCing with community members for real-time feedback on ideas. And for all our efforts, we still get chewed out for every single change without fail. I'm not saying the community isn't entitled to griping about the process, but you should realize it's a 2-way street, and both sides should work towards better collaboration. Demanding that all changes be opt-in or that all MediaWiki-related discussions happen on en.wiki isn't realistic or helpful.

Many users including me have expressed a lack of communication between the two sides, and obviously we need to think about how to improve this. We cannot expect developers to monitor all our village pump discussions, and many of us don't even know where to look and comment on the progress of the MediaWiki development. Sure, there are the occasional Signpost notifications, but they often read like "beware, we are gonna deploy this new feature soon, whether you like it or not".

The notification page could be at mediawiki.org, but some means (e.g., a bot) would be needed to forward notifications to a page on the English Wikipedia (unless we get global watch list functionality). Discussions can take place at the mediawiki.org page. Notifications replicated at the en.wiki page include feature requests (and bug reports) submitted via Bugzilla, using [[mw:Extension:Bugzilla Reports]] as suggested above. # Prior to the mass deployment of a new MW release, it is installed locally at mediawiki.org (or maybe some [[mw:Wikimedia Labs|Wikimedia Labs]] space?), and the community gets notified, having the ability to provide feedback for fine-tuning the new version as well as to catch some late bugs. # Mass deployment of the new MW release.

Of course it ''is'', and as Ryan says above, substantially more effort ''is'' put in to engaging with enwiki than other communities.  The WMF sysadmins, and MediaWiki developers, are certainly happy to work to make that engagement more efficient and effective; but enwiki is far from the sole community deserving of their time, and the extent to which many enwiki users think it should be, is stretching many developers' patience.

I think a very large number of people here don't have a clear awareness of how much less 'important' the English Wikipedia is in the community of MediaWiki wikis than they think it is.  We can [http://s23.org/wikistats/ track] from only the ''public'' internet nearly 40,000 separate MediaWiki instances, comprising a quarter of a billion pages and 63 million users; that's not including an unknown number of corporate internal wikis each with potentially entire workforces as users.  Enwiki claims less than 6% of the total MediaWiki article count and somewhere in the region of 2% of its userbase (the proportion of active users on enwiki, at 0.8%, is vastly lower than the MW average, which is something like 12%).  Is enwiki the single largest wiki in the community?  Yes, obviously, and that's unlikely to ever change.  Is enwiki larger even than the next two put together?  No; enwikt and frwikt have more articles between them.  The top four ''non-WMF'' wikis have both more articles, and more active users, than enwiki.    Everyone in this community badly needs to wake up to the fact that enwiki isn't the centre of the MediaWiki universe, and hasn't been for for years.  And not only is it not the centre of the universe, it's not even close; I think many people believe that enwiki is the 'large minority', when in fact it is only a small slice of the WMF wikis, and an even smaller slice of the entire community.  In actual fact, enwiki probably gets substantially ''more'' attention than it strictly deserves; out of precedent; the fact that the majority of developers are English speaking; and yes, the fact that enwiki is the most vocal and voluminous proponent of MediaWiki developments.  Broadly, it's a mistake to think that enwiki inherently 'deserves' ''any'' significant control over developments to the MediaWiki software.  Don't think, Ohconfucius, of developers either taking ''or needing'' "carte blanche" or consensus from the enwiki community, to implement ''any'' change.  Rather, enwiki exercises influence over MediaWiki by its ''direct'' relationships with developers, who can be enticed to develop features that are beneficial to enwiki and at worst [[mostly harmless]] to the rest of the MediaWiki community.  The enwiki community does itself no favours by alienating those developers, still less by suggesting that enwiki should be able to claim ''even more'' of their time by virtue of some sort of divine right.  Now of course, this is a very unsatisfactory lowest-common-denominator of interaction.  As Ryan says above, the MediaWiki developers interact substantially more with the enwiki community than they do any other wiki community, and are always happy to increase that interaction further.  The WMF sysadmin staff (and it's important to also be cogent of the distinction between the WMF and MediaWiki) interact far more with the enwiki community than they do any other WMF wiki.  Equazcion is absolutely right to say that there is a discussion to be had about how that interaction process can be streamlined and made more effective, and enwiki will certainly have the support of the MediaWiki community in doing so.  But it's important not to lose track of the big picture when framing that discussion, which is that the discussion is about how enwiki can best organise ''itself'' to punch ''above its weight'' in the MediaWiki community when liaising with the developers.

If the developers can then force themselves to do any actual time accounting and planning in this tooling and that makes the development prices more visible to the community.

For more imminent upcoming deployments, see [[:wikitech:Software deployments|Software deployments]] (no way to comment there, admittedly); for more distant upcoming deployments, see [[:mw:Roadmap|Roadmap]] (which has a talkpage). For small (in coding time) tweaks, you can consult commit logs, or the easiest way is to wait for [[:mw:MediaWiki_1.20/wmf4]] to be created, like wmf3 has already been - this usually happens well before deployment to enwiki. There's a talkpage attached wherre you can comment. Finally, if that all sounds like a bit too much, I try to summarise upcoming projects of all sizes in the ''Signpost''{{'s}}s weekly Technology Report, and people are quick to comment on articles there with their thoughts, which have a surprisingly high developer response rate. I'm also open to suggestions on how to improve the report. - [[User:Jarry1250|Jarry1250]]&nbsp;<sup>[''[[User_talk:Jarry1250|Deliberation]] [[Special:Contributions/Jarry1250|needed]]'']</sup> 22:51, 22 May 2012 (UTC) <small>Apologies if you personally knew some of the above Nageh -- I just wanted to be complete(ish) so people reading this could get a feel for the difference avenues available. - [[User:Jarry1250|Jarry1250]]&nbsp;<sup>[''[[User_talk:Jarry1250|Deliberation]] [[Special:Contributions/Jarry1250|needed]]'']</sup> 22:56, 22 May 2012 (UTC)</small> ::::::There's nothing painful about assembling release notes; indeed the developers do it all the time (see [[mw:MediaWiki 1.20/wmf3]], for instance). The question is how to bring that information to enwiki, and the 45,999 other wiki communities, without the very process of notification taking up huge chunks of developers' time. And even whether it's reasonable of enwiki to expect that information ''to'' be brought to them, as opposed to 'merely' placed on a neighbouring wiki which shares user accounts and logins with enwiki.

Clearly we need a higher-profile and more stream-lined venue of communication between the community and developers. In the meantime, if you want to get detailed information on what's coming down the pipe, probably the best place to look is http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.20 and related subpages. Specifically you can see what new changes are in the latest release (for example, http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.20/wmf3#What.27s_new), and when they are going to be deployed to en.wiki (for example, http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.20/Roadmap). These pages are updated every two weeks. Maybe there's some way this could be set up as a feed that gets picked up by other wikis.

Other than the communication and visibility issue, there's currently a bit of ambiguity regarding how development of the software should affect the sites that use it. For example, if en.wiki were a standalone site with no relationship to MediaWiki, we would be looking at updates to the wiki software we use and determining how, and even '''if''', to apply those updates; furthermore, if they are to be applied, how we might customize them to fit our site. The ties we maintain with the software development is partly responsible for the problems we're seeing.   We currently look to the developers and request MediaWiki changes when we want something changed, and to my understanding, that's currently our only option (aside from our copy of MediaWiki's config switches, which by the way are also set by MediaWiki developers). Our administrators can't customize our PHP files, and when such changes are requested of developers, I think both parties assume that the change must be judged as either good for MediaWiki or bad for it, when that might not necessarily be the right question to ask. We here '''are''' only concerned with en.wikipedia. Although I respect that you can't afford to be, maybe that means the separation between MediaWiki and en.wikipedia needs to be made less subtle. MediaWiki was originally developed as "our" software, but now it's not, and continuing to maintain this quasi-bond could be hurting.  As an IT/web guy I know that care needs to be taken when customizing a local installation of web software, otherwise applying future update releases can become a problem, but there is a right way to do it. I don't know if there are currently people in position who could handle something like that, but it might be worth asking. I'm envisioning the posting here of plain-english release notes for an update, describing how users will be affected; noting which changes are optional to the installation; allowing a period for comments on what to do with them; and if non-optional features are proven unpopular enough, discussing whether or not a deeper customization is warranted. Also adding an area where new features and changes specific to en.wiki could be discussed. Features that might work well for MediaWiki as a whole could still make their way to bugzilla. This is all just brainstorming though.
