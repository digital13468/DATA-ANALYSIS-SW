Thefifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we taketo get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyrightsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  Thisprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our valueper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two textfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000+If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then thetotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion EtextFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so itwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.We need your donations more than ever!All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and aretax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

B. Cunninghame GrahamAuthor of "Mogreb-El-Acksa", etc.With a Map [not included in ASCII text]                         I DEDICATE                   THIS SHORT ACCOUNT OF                     A VANISHED ARCADIA                      TO THE AUTHOR OF            `SANTA TERESA, HER LIFE AND TIMES',                     BEING CERTAIN THAT    THE LIFE OF ALL SAINTS IS TO THEM AND US AN ARCADIA;    UNKNOWN TO THEM AND TO US VANISHED WITH THEIR LIVES,     YET STILL REMEMBERED, FITFULLY AS ARE THE JESUITS              IN PARAGUAY, BY A FEW FAITHFUL,WHEN THE ANGELUS WAKES RECOLLECTION IN THE INDIANS' HEARTS.          BUT, THEN, THE ANGELUS (EVEN OF MEMORY)            IS TO THE MOST PART OF MANKIND ONLY             A JANGLING OF AN ANTIQUATED BELL.Preface`Historicus nascitur, non fit.'  I am painfully aware that neithermy calling nor election in this matter are the least sure.  Certain it isthat in youth, when alone the historian or the horseman may be formed,I did little to fit myself for writing history.  Wandering aboutthe countries of which now I treat, I had almost as little objectin my travels as a Gaucho of the outside `camps'.  I never took a noteon any subject under heaven, nor kept a diary, by means of which,my youth departed and the countries I once knew so well transmogrified,I could, sitting beside the fire, read and enjoy the sadness of revisiting,in my mind's eye, scenes that I now remember indistinctly as in a dream.I take it that he who keeps a journal of his doings, setting down day by dayall that he does, with dates and names of places, their longitude and latitudeduly recorded, makes for himself a meal of bitter-sweet;and that your truest dulcamara is to read with glasses the faded notesjotted down hurriedly in rain, in sun, in wind, in camps,by flooded rivers, and in the long and listless hours of heat --in fact, to see again your life, as it were, acted for youin some camera obscura, with the chief actor changed.  But diaries,unless they be mere records of bare facts, must of necessity,as in their nature they are autobiographical, be false guides;so that, perhaps, I in my carelessness was not quite so unwiseas I have often thought myself.  Although I made no notes of anything,caring most chiefly for the condition of my horse, yet when I think on them,pampa and cordillera, virgin forest, the `passes' of the rivers,approached by sandy paths, bordered by flowering and sweet-smelling trees,and most of all the deserted Jesuit Missions, half buriedby the vigorous vegetation, and peopled but by a few white-clad Indians,rise up so clearly that, without the smallest faculty for dealing with thatwhich I have undertaken, I am forced to write.  Flowers, scents,the herds of horses, the ostriches, and the whole charm of that New Worldwhich those who saw it even a quarter of a century ago sawlittle altered from the remotest times, have remained clear and sharp,and will remain so with me to the end.  So to the readers(if I chance to have them) of this short attempt to givesome faint idea of the great Christian Commonwealth of the Jesuit Missionsbetween the Parana and Uruguay, I now address myself.He who attacks a subject quite fallen out of date, and still not old enoughto give a man authority to speak upon it without the fear of contradiction,runs grave risk.Gentle, indulgent reader, if so be that you exist in thesethe days of universal knowledge and self-sufficient criticism,I do not ask for your indulgence for the many errors which no doubthave slipped into this work.  These, if you care to take the trouble,you can verify, and hold me up to shame.  What I do craveis that you will approach the subject with an open mind.  Your Jesuit is,as we know, the most tremendous wild-fowl that the world has known.`La guardia nera' of the Pope, the order which has wroughtso much destruction, the inventors of `Ciencia media',*cradle from which has issued forth Molina, Suarez, and all those villains who,in the days in which the doctrine was unfashionable, decried mere faith,and took their stand on works -- who in this land of preconceived opinioncan spare it a good word?  But, notwithstanding, even a Jansenist, if suchbe left, must yet admit the claim of Francis Xavier as a true, humble saint,and if the sour-faced sectary of Port Royale should refuse, all men of lettersmust perforce revere the writer of the hymn.--* The doctrine of the `Ciencia Media' occurs in the celebrated  `Concordia gratiae et liberi arbitrii', by Luis de Molina (1588).  The concilium de Auxiliis was held to determine whether or not  `concordia' was possible between freewill and grace.  As the Jesuits  stuck by Molina and his doctrines in despite of councils and of popes,  the common saying arose in Spain:  `Pasteles en la pasteleria  y ciencia media en la Compan~ia.'--But into the whole question of the Jesuits I cannot enter,as it entails command of far more foot and half-foot wordsthan I can muster up.  Still, in America, and most of all in Paraguay,I hope to show the Order did much good, and worked amongst the Indianslike apostles, receiving an apostle's true reward of calumny,of stripes, of blows, and journeying hungry, athirst, on foot,in perils oft, from the great cataract of the Paranato the recesses of the Tarumensian woods.  Little enough I personally carefor the political aspect of their commonwealth, or how it actedon the Spanish settlements; of whether or not it turned out profitableto the Court of Spain, or if the crimes and charges of ambitionlaid to the Jesuits' account were false or true.  My only interestin the matter is how the Jesuits' rule acted upon the Indians themselves,and if it made them happy -- more happy or less happythan those Indians who were directly ruled from Spain, or throughthe Spanish Governors of the viceroyalties.  For theories of advancement,and as to whether certain arbitrary ideas of the rights of man,evolved in general by those who in their persons and their livesare the negation of all rights, I give a fico -- yes, your fig of Spain --caring as little as did ancient Pistol for `palabras',and holding that the best right that a man can have is to be happyafter the way that pleases him the most.  And that the Jesuitsrendered the Indians happy is certain, though to those men who fudgea theory of mankind, thinking that everyone is forged upon their anvil,or run out of their own mould, after the fashion of a tallow dip(a theory which, indeed, the sameness of mankind renders at timesnot quite untenable), it seems absurd because the progress of the worldhas gone on other lines -- lines which prolonged indefinitelywould never meet those which the Jesuits drew.  All that I knowis I myself, in the deserted missions, five-and-twenty years agooften have met old men who spoke regretfully of Jesuit times,who cherished all the customs left by the company, and though they spokeat secondhand, repeating but the stories they had heard in youth,kept the illusion that the missions in the Jesuits' time had been a paradise.Into the matter of the Jesuits' motives I do not propose to enter,holding that the origin of motives is too deeply seatedto be worth inquiry until one has more information about the human mindthan even modern `scientists' seem able to impart.  Yet it is certainthe Jesuits in Paraguay had faith fit to remove all mountains,as the brief stories of their lives, so often ending with a rude field-crossby the corner of some forest, and the inscription `hic occissus est'survive to show.  Some men -- such is the complexity of human nature --have undergone trials and persecutions for base motives,and it is open for anyone to say the Jesuits, as they were Jesuits,could do nothing good.  Still, I believe that Father Ruiz Montoya --whose story I have told, how falteringly, and with how little justiceto his greatness, none knows better than myself -- was a good man --that is, a man without ulterior motives, and actuated butby his love to the poor Indians with whom he passed his life.To-day, when no one can see good in anything or anybodyoutside the somewhat beefy pale of the Anglo-Saxon race, I do not hopethat such a mere dabbler in the great mystery of history as I am myselfwill for an instant change one preconceived opinion; for I am well awarethat speeches based on facts are impotent in popular assembliesto change a single vote.It is an article of Anglo-Saxon faith that all the Spanish colonieswere mal-administered, and all the Spanish conquerorsbloodthirsty butchers, whose sole delight was blood.  This, too,from the members of a race who . . .; but `In the multitude of the greyhoundsis the undoing of the hare.'  Therefore, I ask those who imaginethat all Spaniards at the conquest of America were ruffians,to consider the career of Alvar Nunez, who also struts throughhis brief chapter in the pages of my most imperfect book.Still, I admit men of the stamp of Alvar Nunez are most rare,and were still rarer in the sixteenth century; and to find manyof the Ruiz Montoya brand, Diogenes would have needed a lanternfitted with electric light.  In the great controversy which engagedthe pens of many of the best writers of the world last century,after the Jesuits were expelled from Spain and her colonial possessions(then almost half the world), it will be found that amongst all the mudso freely flung about, the insults given and received, hardly anyonebut a few ex-Jesuits had any harm to say of the doings of the Orderduring its long rule in Paraguay.  None of the Jesuits were ever tried;no crimes were charged against them; even the reasons for their expulsionwere never given to the world at large.  Certain it isthat but a few years after their final exit from the missionsbetween the Uruguay and Parana all was confusion.  In twenty yearsmost of the missions were deserted, and before thirty years had passedno vestige of their old prosperity remained.The semi-communism which the Jesuits had introduced was swept away,and the keen light of free and vivifying competition (which beats so fiercelyupon the bagman's paradise of the economists) reigned in its stead.The revenues declined,* all was corruption, and, as the Governor,Don Juan Jose Vertiz, writes to the Viceroy,** the secular priestssent by the Government were brawlers, drunkards, and strikers,carrying arms beneath their cloaks; that robbery was rife;and that the Indians daily deserted and returned by hundreds to the woods.--* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,  Buenos Aires, 1816.** Idem.  The letter is dated 1771 and the Jesuits were expelled in 1767.   As the writer of the letter was on the spot in an official position,   and nominated by the very Viceroy who had been the expeller of the Jesuits,   his testimony would seem to be as valuable as that of the ablest theorist   on government, Catholic or Protestant, who ever wrote.--All the reports of riches amassed in Paraguay by the Jesuits,after the expulsion of their order proved to be untrue;nothing of any consequence was found in any of the towns,although the Jesuits had had no warning of their expulsion,and had no time for preparation or for concealment of their gold.Although they stood to the Indians almost in the light of gods,and had control of an armed force larger by far than anywhich the temporal power could have disposed of, they did not resist,but silently departed from the rich territories which their care and industryhad formed.Rightly or wrongly, but according to their lights, they strove to teachthe Indian population all the best part of the European progress of the timesin which they lived, shielding them sedulously from all contactwith commercialism, and standing between them and the Spanish settlers,who would have treated them as slaves.  These were their crimes.For their ambitions, who shall search the human heart,or say what their superiors in Europe may, or perhaps may not,have had in view?  When all is said and done, and now their work is over,and all they worked for lost (as happens usually with the effortsof disinterested men), what crime so terrible can men commit as to stand upfor near upon two centuries against that slavery which disgracedevery American possession of the Spanish* crown?  Nothing is bad enoughfor those who dare to speak the truth, and those who put their theoriesinto practice are a disgrace to progressive and adequately taxed communities.Nearly two hundred years they strove, and now their territories,once so populous and so well cultivated, remain, if not a desert,yet delivered up to that fierce-growing, subtropical American plant lifewhich seems as if it fights with man for the possession of the landin which it grows.  For a brief period those Guaranis gathered togetherin the missions, ruled over by their priests, treated like grown-up children,yet with a kindness which attached them to their rulers,enjoyed a half-Arcadian, half-monastic life, reaching to just so muchof what the world calls civilization as they could profit by and usewith pleasure to themselves.  A commonwealth where money was unknownto the majority of the citizens, a curious experiment by self-devoted men,a sort of dropping down a diving-bell in the flood of progressto keep alive a population which would otherwise soon have been suffocatedin its muddy waves, was doomed to failure by the very nature of mankind.Foredoomed to failure, it has disappeared, leaving nothing of a like naturenow upon the earth.  The Indians, too, have vanished, gone to that limbowhich no doubt is fitted for them.  Gentle, indulgent reader,if you read this book, doubt not an instant that everything that happenshappens for the best; doubt not, for in so doing you would doubtof all you see -- our life, our progress, and your own infallibility,which at all hazards must be kept inviolate.  Therefore in my imperfect sketchI have not dwelt entirely on the strict concatenation(after the Bradshaw fashion) of the hard facts of the history of the Jesuits.I have not set down too many dates, for the setting down of datesin much profusion is, after all, an ad captandum appealto the suffrages of those soft-headed creatures who are styled serious men.--* This, of course, applies to the possessions of all European States  in America equally with Spain.--Wandering along the by-paths of the forests which fringe the mission towns,and set them, so to speak, in the hard tropical enamel of green foliage,on which time has no lien, and but the arts of all-destroying manare able to deface, I may have chanced upon some petty detail which may serveto pass an hour away.A treatise of a forgotten subject by a labourer unskilled, and who, moreover,by his very task challenges competition with those who have writtenon the theme, with better knowledge, and perhaps less sympathy;a pother about some few discredited and unremembered priests;details about half-savages, who `quoi! ne portaient pasdes haults de chausses'; the recollections of long silent ridesthrough forest paths, ablaze with flowers, and across which the tropic birdsdarted like atoms cut adrift from the apocalypse; a hotch-potch, salmagundi,olla podrida, or sea-pie of sweet and bitter, with perhaps the bitterruling most, as is the way when we unpack our reminiscences --yes, gentle and indulgent reader, that's the humour of it.

As no definite charges were ever brought,at least in Spain, against the members of the Company of Jesus(King Charles III. having kept the reasons `ocultas y reservadas'and the proofs `privilegiados'), curiosity is to some extent not satisfiedas to the real reason of their expulsion from the Spanish possessionsin America.It is almost impossible to understand nowadays the feelingswhich possessed the average man in regard to the Jesuitsfrom the middle of the last century till a relatively short time ago.All the really great work done by the Society of Jesusseemed to have been forgotten, and every vulgar fablewhich it was possible to invent to their prejudice found ready acceptanceupon every side.  Nothing was too absurd to be believed.From the calumnies of the Jansenists to the follies of Eugene Suethe mass of accusation, invective, and innuendo kept on increasingin intensity.  Indiscriminate abuse and unreasoning hatred,mixed with fear, seem to have possessed all minds.  Even Pascalconfesses (in a postscript to the ninth Provincial Letter) that`after having written my letter I read the works of Fathers Barry and Binet.'If such a man as Pascal could be so grossly unfair as to write a criticismon works which he had not read, what can be expected fromthe non-judicial and uncritical public which takes all upon trust?From Japan to the interior of Bolivia there is scarcely a countryin which the Jesuits have not laboured assiduously, and in whichthey have not shed their blood freely without hope of reward,yet it would require much time and a lengthy catalogue to enumeratethe list of satirical and calumnious works which have appeared against themin almost every language in Europe.  Of these, perhaps the most celebratedis the well-known `Monarquia de los Solipsos',* by Padre Melchior Inshoffer,an ex-Jesuit, who describes the company in the worst possible terms.It is interesting chiefly on account of the portraits of well-knownpeople of the time (1615 to 1648), as Pope Clement VIII., Francisco Suarez,Claudio Aquaviva, and others, veiled under easily distinguishable pseudonyms.The object of the writer, as the title indicates, is to show that the Jesuitsendeavoured to turn all to their own profit.  In this, if it was the case,they do not seem to have been greatly different from every other associatedbody of men, whether lay or clerical.  The celebrated Spanish proverb,`Jesuita y se ahorca, cuenta le hace', meaning, Even if a Jesuit is hunghe gets some good out of it, may just as well be appliedto members of other learned professions as to the Jesuits.--* Madrid, 1770.--The world has rarely persecuted any body of men conspicuous by its poverty,or if it has done so has rarely persecuted them for long.The Inquisition of Spain, violent against the wealthy Jewsand comfortable Moriscos, took little notice of the Gipsies;but, then, `Pobre como cuerpo de Gitano' was and is a common saying in Spain.As in the case of the Templars, persecution only began against the Jesuitswhen it became worth while to persecute them.  Ignatius Loyola,Francisco Xavier, and Diego Lainez, as long as theyconfined themselves to preaching and to teaching, were safe enough.Even the annals of theological strife, bloodthirsty and discreditableto humanity as they are, contain few examples of persecutorssuch as Calvin or Torquemada, to whom, ruthless as they werein their savage and narrow malignity and zeal for what they thought the truth,no suspicion of venal motives is attributed.Of the Jesuits' intrigues, adventures, rise and fall in Europe,much may be said in attack or in extenuation; but it is notthe intention of the present work to deal with this aspect of the question.It was in Spanish America, and especially in Paraguay and Bolivia,where the policy of the Company in regard to savage nationswas most fully developed, as it was only the Jesuits who ever succeededin reclaiming any large number of the nomad or semi-nomad tribesof those countries.Many excellent works in French, and the celebrated `Christianismo Felicenel Paraguay' of the Abbate Muratori in Italian, certainly exist.But neither Father Charlevoix, the French historian of the missions,nor Muratori was ever in Paraguay, and both their books containthe faults and mistakes of men, however excellent and well intentioned,writing of countries of which they were personally ignorant.Both give a good account of the customs and regimen of the missions,but both seem to have believed too readily fabulous accountsof the flora and fauna of Paraguay.*  The fact of having listened too readilyto a fable about an unknown animal in no way detracts fromthe general veracity of an author of the beginning of the eighteenth century,for in all other respects except natural history Charlevoix keepswithin the bounds of probability, though of course as a Jesuithe holds a brief for the doings of the Company in Paraguay.Muratori is more rarely led into extravagances, but is concerned in the mainwith the religious side of the Jesuits, as the title of his book indicates.--* Though in this respect Charlevoix is not so credulous  as Padre Ruiz de Montoya and the older writers, he yet repeats  the story of the bird that cleans the alligator's teeth,  the magic virtues of the tapir's nails, and many others.  See Charlevoix, vol. i., bk. i., p. 27, Paris, 1756.  [The story of the bird that cleans the teeth of alligators  is very nearly true -- `Pluvianus aegyptius' has a symbiotic relationship  with crocodiles in parts of Africa, and similar relationships exist  throughout the natural world.  -- A. L., 1998.]--Many other French writers, as Raynal, Montesquieu, and Voltaire,have treated of Paraguay under Jesuit rule, but their writings are foundedon hearsay evidence.  A German, Father Dobrizhoffer, stands alone.*His delightful `History of the Abipones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay',is perhaps the most charming book dealing with the subject.A simple and easy style, a keen habit of observation,long acquaintance with the country, a zeal for the conversion of the infidel,not only to Christianity, but to a more comfortable mode of life,to which he adds a faith sufficient to move the Cordillera of the Andes,but at the same time restricted by a common-sense and veracitynot always observable in religious writers, render Dobrizhoffera personal friend after the perusal of his writings.--* Dobrizhoffer's book was written in Latin, and printed in Vienna in 1784  under the title of `Historia de Abiponibus', etc.  A German translation  by Professor Keil was published at Pesth in the same year.  The English translation is of the year 1822.--English is singularly barren in regard to the Jesuits in Paraguay.Father Falconer, an English Jesuit, has left a curious and interesting book(printed at Hereford in 1774), but he treats exclusively of what is nowthe province of Buenos Ayres, the Falkland Islands, and of Patagonia.As an Englishman and a Jesuit (a somewhat rare combinationin the eighteenth century), and as one who doubtless knewmany of the Paraguayan priests, his testimony would have been most important,especially as he was a man of great information, much education,an intrepid traveller, and, moreover, only entered the Company of Jesusat a comparatively advanced age.It is in Spanish, or in Latin by Spanish authors, that the greater portionof the contemporary histories and accounts are to be found.*Literatures, like other things, have their times of fashion.At one time a knowledge of Spanish was as requisite assome tincture of French is at present, and almost as universal.Men from Germany, England, and Holland who met in a foreign countrycommunicated in that language.  In the early portion of the centuryTicknor, Prescott, and Washington Irving rendered Spanish literaturefashionable to some degree.--* It is to be remembered that the Spanish colonists were as a rule  antagonistic to the Jesuits, and that, therefore, Spanish writers  do not of necessity hold a brief for the Jesuits in Paraguay.  Moreover, the names of Esmid (Smith), Fildo (Fields), Dobrizhoffer,  Cataldini and Tomas Bruno (Brown, who is mentioned as being  `natural de Yorca'), Filge, Limp, Pifereti, Enis, and Asperger,  the quaint medical writer on the virtues of plants found  in the mission territory, show how many foreign Jesuits were actually  to be found in the reductions of Paraguay.  For more information  on this matter see the `Coleccion de Documentos relativos a/ la Expulsion  de los Jesuitas de la Republica Argentina y Paraguay',  published and collected by Francisco Javier Brabo, Madrid, 1872.--Later the historical researches of Sir William Stirling Maxwelldrew some attention to it.  To-day hardly any literature of Europeis so little studied in England.  Still leaving apartthe purely literary treasures of the language, it is in Spanish,and almost alone in Spanish, that the early history of America is to be found.After the struggle for independence which finished about 1825,some interest was excited in the Spanish-American countries,stimulated by the writings of Humboldt; but when it became apparentthat on the whole those countries could never be occupiedby Northern Europeans, interest in them died out except for purposes connectedwith the Stock Exchange.  Yet there is a charm which attaches to themwhich attaches to no other countries in the world.  It was therethat one of the greatest dramas, and certainly the greatest adventurein which the human race has engaged, took place.  What Africa has beenfor the last twenty years, Spanish America was three hundred years ago,the difference being that, whereas modern adventure in Africagoes on under full observation, and deals in the main with absolutelyuncivilized peoples, the conquest of South America was investedwith all the charm of novelty, and brought the conquerors into contact withat least two peoples almost as advanced in most of the arts of civilizationas they were themselves.When first Sebastian Cabot and Solis ascended the Parana,they found that the Guaranis of Paraguay had extendedin no instance to the western shore of either of those rivers.The western banks were inhabited then, as now, by the wandering Indiansof the still not entirely explored territory of the Gran Chaco.Chaco* is a Quichua Indian word meaning `hunting' or `hunting-ground',and it is said that after the conquest of Peru the Indian tribeswhich had been recently subjugated by the Incas took refugein this huge domain of forest and of swamp.--* The Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, in his `Commentarios Reales' (en Madrid 1723,  en la oficina Real y a/ costa de Nicholas Rodriguez Franco,  Impressor de libros, se hallaran en su casa en la calle  de el Poc,o y en Palacio), derives the word from  the Quichua `Chacu/' = a surrounding.  If he is right, it would then be  equivalent to the Gaelic `tinchel'.  Taylor, the Water-poet,  has left a curious description of one of these tinchels.  It was at a tinchel that the rising under the Earl of Mar in the '15  was concocted.--Be that as it may, the Chaco Indians of to-day, comprising the remnantsof the Lulis, Tobas, Lenguas, Mocobios, and others, are almost as savageas when first we hear of them in the pages of Alvar Nunezand Hulderico Schmidel.  These tribes the Jesuits on many occasionsattempted to civilize, but almost entirely without success, as the long recordof the martyrdom of Jesuit missionaries in the Chaco proves,as well as the gradual abandonment of their missions there,towards the second half of the eighteenth century.Certain it is that at various places in the Chaco, in the quaint old mapsthe Jesuits have left us, one reads `Mission de Santa Cruz de los Vilelas',`Mission de la Concepcion de los Frontones', and others; but muchmore frequently their maps are studded with crosses, and some such legendas `Hic occisi sunt PP. Antonius Salinus et Petrus Ortiz Zarate'.*It was only when the Jesuits encountered the more peaceful Guaranisthat they met with real success.--* See the curious map contained in the now rare work of P. Pedro Lozano,  entitled, `Descripcion Chorographica . . . del Gran Chaco, Gualamba', etc.  Also in the interesting collection of old maps published in 1872 at Madrid  by Francisco Javier Brabo.--What was the nature of their success, how durable it was,what were the reasons which caused the expulsion of the order from America,and especially from Paraguay, and what has been the result uponthe remainder of the Indians, it is my object to endeavour to explain.A long residence in the river Plate, together with two visits to Paraguay,in one of which I saw almost all the remnants of the Paraguayan missionsand a few of those situated in the province of Corrientes,and in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul, have given mesome personal acquaintance with the subject.*--* It is, of course, to be taken into consideration that my two journeys  in Paraguay were made after the great war which terminated in 1870,  after lasting four years; but the writings of Demersay  (`Histoire du Paraguay et des E/tablissements des Je/suites',  Paris, 1862), those of Brabo, and of Azara, show the deserted state  of the district of Misiones in the period from 1767,  the date of the expulsion of the Jesuits, to the middle of  the nineteenth century.--The actual condition of the rich district of Misiones (Paraguay)at the time I visited it, shortly after the conclusion of the great warbetween Paraguay and Brazil in 1870, does not enable meto speak with authority on the condition of communities,the guiding spirits of which were expelled as far back as the year 1767.The actual buildings of the missions, the churches in a dismantled state,have indeed survived; in many instances the tall date-palmsthe Jesuits planted still wave over them.  Generally the college was occupiedby the Indian Alcalde, who came out to meet the visitor on a horseif he possessed one, with as much silver about the bridle and stirrupsas he could afford, clothed in white, with a cloak of red baize,a large `jipi-japa' hat, and silver spurs buckled on his naked feet.If he had never left the mission, he talked with wonder and respectof the times of the Jesuits, and at the `oracion' knelt downto pray wherever the sound of the angelus might catch him.His children before bedtime knelt all in a row to ask his blessing.If he had been to Asuncion, he probably remarked that the peopleunder those accursed priests were naught but animals and slaves,and launched into some disquisition he had heard in the solitary cafewhich Asuncion then boasted.  In the latter case, after muchof the rights of man and the duties of hospitality, he generally presented youwith a heavy bill for Indian corn and `pindo'* which your horse had eaten.In the former, usually he bade you go with God, and, if you spoke of payment,said:  `Well, send me a book of Hours when you get to Asuncion.'--* `Cocos Australis'.--Of Indians, hardly any were left to judge of, for in the villages in which,according to the reports furnished to Bucareli, the Viceroy of Buenos Ayresat the time of the expulsion of the Jesuits, the population numberedin the thirty towns of the missions one hundred and twenty thousand,*a population of at most twenty thousand was to be found.On every side the powerful vegetation had covered up the fields.On ruined church and chapel, and on broken tower, the lianas climbedas if on trees, creeping up the belfries, and throwinggreat masses of scarlet and purple flowers out of the apertureswhere once were hung the bells.  In the thick jungles a few half-wild cattlestill were to be found.  The vast `estancias', where oncethe Jesuits branded two and three thousand calves a year,and from whence thousands of mules went forth to Chile and Bolivia,were all neglected.  Horses were scarce and poor, crops few and indifferent,and the plantations made by the Jesuits of the tree (`Ilex Paraguayensis')from which is made the `yerba mate', were all destroyed.--* See the reports of the Marques de Valdelirios and others  in the publications of Francisco Javier Brabo, Madrid, 1872,  and in the `Ensayo de la Historia Civil de Paraguay,  Buenos-Ayres y Tucuman', por Dr. Don Gregorio Funes, Buenos Ayres, 1816.--In the vast forests, stretching to the Salto de Guayra,a few scattered tribes, known as Caaguas, roamed through the thickets,or encamped upon the streams.  In the thirty towns,once full of life and stir, in every one of which there was a church,finer, as an old Spanish writer says, than any in Buenos Ayres,there was naught but desolation and despair.  The Indians eitherhad returned into the woods, been killed in the ceaseless revolutionary wars,or had been absorbed into the Gaucho populations of Corrientes, Rio Grande,Entre Rios, and of Santa Fe.It may be that all Indian races are destined to disappearif they come into contact with Europeans; certainly, experience would seemto confirm the supposition.  The policy of the Jesuits, however,was based on isolation of their missions, and how this might have workedis matter at least for speculation.  It was on account of the isolationwhich they practised that it was possible for the extravagant calumnieswhich were circulated as to their rule and riches to gain belief.It was on account of isolation that the first conflicts arosebetwixt them and the authorities, both clerical and lay.  That the Jesuitswere more highly esteemed than the other religious orders in Spanish Americain the seventeenth century, the saying current in those days,`Los demas van a/ un~a, los Jesuitas a/ una' -- i.e., The others getall they can, but the Jesuits have one aim (the conversion of the Indians) --seems to show.It is not my purpose to deal with the probable reasonswhich induced their expulsion in Europe.  Suffice it to say that,whatever crimes or misdemeanours they were guilty of,they were never called on to answer before any tribunals,and that in many instances they were treated, especially in Portugal,with great cruelty and injustice.The burning, at the age of eighty, of the unfortunate Malagrida in Lisbonunder the auspices of Pombal, for a book which it seems improbablehe could have written in prison at so great an age, and which, moreover,was never brought into court, only supposed extracts from it being read,may serve as an example.  In order clearly to understandthe position of the Jesuits in America, and especiallyin Paraguay and Bolivia, it is necessary to glance brieflyat the history of the first conquest of the river Plate.The discovery of America opened up to Europe, and especially to Spain,opportunities for expansion of national territory and individual advancementwhich no epoch, either before or since, has equalled.From a cluster of small States, struggling for existenceagainst a powerful enemy on their own soil, in a few yearsSpain became the greatest empire of the world.  The result was thata spirit of adventure and a desire to grow rich speedily possessedall classes.  In addition to this, every Spaniard in Americaduring the first few years of the conquest seemed to consider himself,to some extent, not only as a conqueror, but also as a missionary.Now, missionaries and conquerors are men, on the whole, more imbued withtheir own importance and sanctity, and less disposed to consider consequences,than almost any other classes of mankind.  The conjunction of the two in onedisposed the `conquistadores' of America to imagine that,no matter how cruel or outrageous their treatment of the Indians was,they atoned for all by the introduction of what they consideredthe blessing of the knowledge of the true faith.  It will beseen at once that, if one can determine with accuracywhich of the many `faiths' preached about the world is actuallythe true faith, a man who is in possession of it is acting properlyin endeavouring to diffuse it.  The meanest soldier in the various armieswhich left Spain to conquer America seems to have had no doubtabout the matter.Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who, as he himself relates,came to America at the age of eighteen, and therefore could have hadlittle previous opportunity of studying theology, and who, moreover,was unfitted to do so by the want of knowledge of Latin, to whichhe himself confesses, yet at the end of his history of the conquest of Mexico,one of the most interesting books ever written, has the following passage:`But it is to be noted that, after God, it was we, the real conquerors,who discovered them [the Indians] and conquered them; and from the firstwe took away their idols, and taught them our holy doctrine,and to us is due the reward and credit of it all, before any other people,even though they be churchmen:  for when the beginning is good,the middle and ending is good, which the curious [i.e., attentive] readermay see in the Christian polity and justice which we showed them in New Spain.`And I will leave the matter, and tell the other benefits which, after God,by our agency, came to the natives of New Spain.'*--* Bernal Diaz, `Historia de la Conquista de la Nueva Espan~a',  vol. iv., cap. 207, Madrid, 1796.--One would imagine, on reading the above extract, Bernal Diaz had neverkilled an Indian in his life, and that he had sacrificed his prospectsin coming to Mexico solely to introduce `a Christian polity and justice'amongst the inhabitants.  Yet he was no hypocrite, but a stoutsagacious soldier, even kindly, according to his lights,and with a love of animals uncommon in a Spaniard, for he has preservedthe names and qualities of all the horses and mares which came overin the fleet from the Havana with Cortes.*  The phrase, `despues de Dios'(after God) occurs repeatedly in the writings of almost allthe `conquistadores' of America.  Having, after God, conquered America,the first action of the conquerors was to set about making their fortunes.In those countries which produced gold and silver, as Mexico and Peru,they worked the mines by the labour of the Indians,the cruelties and hardships being so great that, in a letter of Philip II. tothe Come de Chinchon, the Viceroy of Peru, dated Madrid, April 30, 1639,written fifty years after the discovery, he says:  `These Indians flee,become ill, and die, and have begun to diminish greatly in number,and they will be finished soon unless an efficient remedyis provided shortly.'--* Especially noting down the appearance and qualities of `el caballo Motilla',  the horse of Gonzalo de Sandoval.  Thus does he minutely describe Motilla,  `the best horse in Castille or the Indies'.  `El mejor caballo,  y de mejor carrera, revuelto a/ una mano y a\ otra que decian  que no se habia visto mejor en Castilla, ni en esa tierra  era castan~o acastan~ado, y una estrella en la frente,  y un pie izquierdo calzado, que se decia el caballo Motilla;  e/ quando hay ahora diferencia sobre buenos caballos,  suclen decir es en bondad tan bueno como Motilla.'--In Paraguay there were no mines, but there were other methodsof extracting money from the Indians.  At the first conquestParaguay was not the little country bounded on the west by the Paraguay,on the south by the Parana, on the north by the Aquidaban,and on the east by Sierra of Mbaracavu, as it is at present.On the contrary, it embraced almost all that immense territoryknown to-day as the Argentine Confederation, some of the Republic of Uruguay,and a great portion of Brazil, embracing much of the provinces of Misiones,Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, and Matto Grosso, as well as Paraguay itself.How the little country, twelve hundred miles from the sea,came to give its name to such an enormous territory, and to havethe seat of government at Asuncion, demands some explanation.Peru and Chile were discovered and occupied some time beforethe eastern side of South America.  Their riches naturally drewgreat attention to them; but the voyage, first to Cartagena de Indias,and then across the isthmus, and the re-embarkation again on the Pacific,were both costly and arduous.  It had been the ambition of all explorersto discover some river which would lead from the Atlanticto the mines of Peru and what is now Bolivia, then known as Alta Peru.Of course, this might have been achieved by ascending the Amazon,especially after the adventurous descent of it by Orellana,of which Fray Gaspar de Carbajal has left so curious a description;but, whether on account of the distance or for some other reason,it never seems to have been attempted.In 1526 Sebastian Cabot left Spain with three small vessels and a caravelfor the object of reaching the Moluccas or Spice Islands.It was his purpose to reach them through the Straits of Magellan.Being compelled by want of supplies to abandon his route, he entereda broad estuary, and ascended it under the impression that he had discoveredanother channel to the Pacific.  He soon found his mistake,and began to explore the surrounding country.  Fifteen years before,with the same object, Juan de Solis had entered the same estuary.On the island of Martin Garcia he was killed by a Chana Indian,and his expedition returned home.  Hearing that there was much silverat the head-waters, he had called it the Rio de la Plata.If we take the head-waters of the river Plate to be situated in Bolivia,there certainly was much silver there; but Cabot was unawarethat the head-waters were above two thousand miles from the estuary,and he was not destined to come near them.  He did go as faras a point on the river Caracara, in what is now the province of Santa Fe,and there he built a fort which he named Espiritu Santo,the first Spanish settlement in that part of America.Whilst at Espiritu Santo, several exploring parties were sentto scour the country.  One of them, under a soldier of the name of Cesar,never returned.  Tradition, always eager to make up to historyfor its want of interest, asserted that after marching for yearsthey reached a city.  Perhaps it was the mystic Trapalanda of whichthe Gauchos used to discourse at night when seated round a fire of bonesupon the pampa.  Perhaps some other, for enchanted cities and Eldoradoswere plentiful in those days in America, alternating with occasional empires,as that of Puytita, near the Laguna de los Xarayes, Manoa,and the Ciudad de los Cesares, supposed to be situated near Araucoin the Chilian Andes.  However, one of the party actually returnedafter years, and related his adventures to Ruy Diaz de Guzman,*the first historian of Paraguay.  Thus it was that the stream of adventurerswas ever seeking for a channel to the mines of Peru from the Atlantic coast.Cabot appears to have ascended the Parana to the island of Apipe,and then, returning, entered the river Paraguay.  Having ascendedpast what is now Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, Cabot encounteredIndians from the north who told him of the mines in Peru and in Bolivia,probably unaware that Cabot knew of them already.  At this point,encouraged by what he heard, he gave the name of Rio de la Platato what had previously been known either as La Mar Dulce or El Rio de Solis.Like most names which are wrongly given, it remained to testifyto the want of knowledge of the giver.  Four years after, Cabot returnedto Spain, having failed to attract attention to his discoveries.In the face of the wealth which was pouring in from the Peruvian mines,another expedition started for the river Plate.  Its General -- for in Spainthe title was used indifferently by land and sea -- was Don Pedro de Mendoza,a gentleman of Guadix in Almeria, and a member of the household of Charles V.--* `La Argentina', included in the `Coleccion de Angelis', Buenos Ayres, 1836.--Don Pedro had seen service in the Italian wars, and seems to have beena man of character and bravery, but wanting in the discretionand the necessary tact essential in the founder of a colony.In 1534 the expedition started, unfortunate almost from the first.In a `certain island', as the historian of the expedition, Hulderico Schmidel,a German or Flemish soldier, calls Rio Janeiro, a dispute occurredbetween Don Pedro and his second in command, Juan de Osorio.At a court-martial held upon Osorio, Don Pedro appears to have let fallsome remarks which Juan de Ayolas, the Alguazil Mayor (Chief Constable),seems to have taken up as an order for instant execution.This he performed upon the spot, plunging his dagger repeatedly into Osorio,or, as Hulderico Schmidel has it, `sewing him up with cuts'(`cosiendole a\ pun~aladas').  This murder or execution -- for whoshall tell when murder finishes and its legal counterpart begins? --rendered Don Pedro very unpopular with all the fleet; for, as Schmidel has itin his history,* `the soldiers loved Osorio.'  To be loved by the soldierswas the only chance a Spanish officer had in those times of holding his own.Both Schmidel and Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who had both been common soldiers,and who, curiously, both wrote histories, lose no occasion of vilifyingofficers who used the soldiers hardly.  It is true that Bernal Diaz(who, unlike Schmidel, was a man of genius) does so with some discretion,and always apparently with reason.  Schmidel, on the other hand,seems to have considered that any officer who interferedbetween the soldiers and the Indians was a tyrant, and hencehis denunciation of Alvar Nunez, under whom he served.--* `Historia y Descubrimiento de el Rio de la Plata y Paraguay',  Hulderico Schmidel, contained in the collection made  by Andres Gonzalez Barcia, and published in 1769 at Madrid  under the title of `Historiadores Primitivos de las Indias Occidentales'.--In 1535 the expedition entered the river Plate.  Here Mendoza,with his usual want of judgment, pitched upon what is nowthe site of Buenos Ayres as the spot on which to found his colony.It would be difficult to select a more inconvenient placein which to found a town.  The site of Buenos Ayres is almost levelwith the waters of the river Plate, which there are shallow --so shallow that large vessels could not approach nearerthan ten to fifteen miles.  Without a harbour, the anchorage was exposedto the full fury of the south-west gales, known as `pamperos'.However, if the site was bad the air was good; at least, it seems so,for a captain of the expedition exclaimed on landing, `Que buenos airesson estos!' and hence the name.  Here every sort of evil chancecame on the newborn colony.  The Pampa Indians, whom the historian Schmidelseems to have only known by their Guarani name of Querandis,at first were friendly.  After a little while they ceased to bring provisions,and the General sent out an expedition to compel them under his brother,Don Diego de Mendoza.  It does not seem to have occurredto Don Pedro de Mendoza that, had the `cacique' of the Querandislanded in Spain, no one would have brought him provisions for a single daywithout receiving payment.  However, Don Pedro* had come to Americato introduce civilization and Christianity, and therefore,knowing, like Bernal Diaz and the other conquerors, his own moral worth,was justly indignant that after a day or two the Indiansrefused him more supplies.  In the encounter which took placebetween the Spaniards and the Indians, Don Diego de Mendoza was slain,and with him several others.  Here for the first time we hear of the bolas,or three stones united, like a Manxman's legs, with strips of hide,with which, as Hulderico Schmidel tells us, the Indians caught the horsesby the legs and threw them down.  After this foretaste of European justice,the Indians besieged the newly-built town and brought it to great straits,so much so that, after three men had been hung for stealing a horse,in the morning it was discovered they had been cut down and eaten.In this desperate state Don Pedro despatched Juan de Ayolas to get supplies.He, having obtained some maize from the Timbu Indians, returned,leaving a hundred of his men in a little fort, called Corpus Christi,close to Espiritu Santo, the fort which Cabot had constructed.The friendliness of the Timbus induced Don Pedro to abandon Buenos Ayresand move to Corpus Christi.  There he repaired with about five hundred men,all who remained of the two thousand six hundred and thirtywith which he sailed from Cadiz.  The horses he abandoned on the pampa;there they became the ancestors of the innumerable herds which at one timeoverspread the Argentine Republic from the Chaco to Patagonia,and whose descendants to this day stock the `estancias' of that country.**--* The great Las Casas, who made seven voyages from America to Spain  -- the last at the age of seventy-two -- to protect the Indians,  had a strong opinion about `conquerors' and `conquests'.  In the dedication of his great treatise on the wrongs of the Indians,  he says:  `Que no permita (Felipe II.) las atrocidades  que los tiranos inventaron, y que prosiguen haciendo  con titulo de "conquistas".  Los que se jactan de ser "conquistadores"  a que descienden de ellos son muchomas orgullosos arrogantes y vanos  que los otros Espan~oles.'  Strange that even to-day  the same `atrocidades' of `tiranos' are going on in Africa.  No doubt the descendants of these `conquerors' will be  as arrogant, proud, and vain as the descendants of the `conquistadores'  of whom Las Casas writes.** Mendoza left (`Azara Apuntamientos para la Historia Natural   de los Quadrupedes del Paraguay', etc.) five mares and seven horses   in the year 1535.  In 1580 Don Juan de Garay, at the second founding   of the city, already found troops of wild horses.  The cattle increased   to a marvellous extent, and by the end of the century   were wild in Patagonia.  Sarmiento (`Civilisation et Barbarisme')   says that early in this century they were often killed by travellers,   who tethered their horses to the carcasses to prevent them   from straying at night.--From Corpus Christi Juan de Ayolas was sent out to explore the river,and try to find the long-sought-for waterway to the Peruvian mines.He never reached Peru, and Corpus Christi never saw him return.Mendoza waited a year, and then returned to Spain, leaving his garrisonwith provisions for a year, the bread* `at the rate of (`a/ razon de')a pound a day, and if they wanted more to get it for themselves.'On the passage home he died insane.  The pious were of opinionthat it was a judgment on him for the murder of Don Juan Osorio.Before he embarked, Don Pedro had despatched a relative, Gonzalo de Mendoza,to Spain to bring provisions and recruits.  Gonzalo, having obtainedprovisions in Brazil, returned to Corpus Christi; thence in companywith Salazar de Espinosa he headed an expedition up the riverin search of Juan de Ayolas, who had been appointed successor to Don Pedro.With them went Domingo Martinez de Irala, a man destined to play a great partin the conquest of Paraguay.--* Hulderico Schmidel, `Historia del Descubrimiento de el Rio de la Plata  y Paraguay'.--The expedition went up the Paraguay to a place near Fort Olimpo(21 Degrees long., 58 Degrees lat.) about a hundred leagues above Asuncion.Here they sent out exploring parties in all directions to seek Ayolas,but without success.  Irala remained with one hundred men at Fort Olimpo.Gonzalo de Mendoza on his return, being attracted by the sight of a fine sitefor a town, landed, and on the fifteenth day of August, 1537,founded Asuncion.  Here the Spaniards first met the Guaranis,who were destined in after-years to be the converts of the Jesuits,and be assembled by them in their famous missions.`At the discovery of America,' says Felix de Azara in his`Descripcion y Historia del Paraguay', `the Guaranis were spreadfrom the Guianas to the shores of the river Plate, and occupiedall the islands of the Parana extending up to latitude 20 Degreeson the Paraguay, but without crossing either that river or the river Plate.'They had also a few towns in the province of Chiquitos,and the nation of the Chiriguanas was an offshoot from them.In Brazil they were soon all either rendered slaves or so crossedwith the African negro that the pure race has been almost entirely lost,though the language remains under the name of the Lingoa Geral,and many words from it have been introduced into Portuguesespoken by the Brazilians, as `capim', grass; `caipira', half-caste, etc.In fact, so great is the number of these words, idioms, phrases,and terms of speech derived from Guarani, that Dr. Baptista de Almeida,in his preface to his grammar published at Rio Janeiro (1879), computes thatthere are more words derived from Guarani than even from Arabicin the Portuguese spoken in Brazil.*  The Guaranis in Brazilwere known either as Tupis, from the word `tupy',** savage, or Tupinambas,from `tupynamba', literally, the savage or indigenous men.--* Perhaps the two most important works upon the language  are the `Tesoro de la Lengua Guarani', by Ruiz de Montoya,  Madrid, 1639 (it is dedicated to the `Soberana Virgen');  and the `Catecismo de la Lengua Guarani', by Diego Diaz de la Guerra,  Madrid, An~o de 1630.  He also wrote a `Bocabulario y Arte  de la Lengua Guarani'.** P. Guevara, in his `Historia del Paraguay', relates a curious story   which he said was current amongst the Indians.  Two brothers,   Tupi and Guarani, lived with their families upon the sea-coast of Brazil.   In those days the world was quite unpopulated but by themselves.   They quarrelled about a parrot, and Tupi with his family went north,   and populated all Brazil; whilst Guarani went west,   and was the ancestor of all the Indians of the race of Guaranis.--Jean de Lery, the well-known Huguenot pastor and friend of Calvin,passed a year on the coast of Brazil about 1558, having accompaniedthe expedition of the famous Villegagnau.  In his book(`Histoire d'un Voyage faict en la Terre du Brezil') he alwaysrefers to the Indians as Toupinaubaoults, and has preservedmany curious details of them before they had had much contact with Europeans.He appears to have had a considerable acquaintance with the language,and has left some curious conversations `en langage sauvage et Franc,ais',in which he gives some grammatical rules.  The language of conversationis almost identical with that of Paraguay, though some words are usedwhich are either peculiar to the Tupis or obsolete in Paraguay to-day.His account of their customs tallies with that of the variousSpanish writers and explorers who have written on the subject.Tobacco, which seems to have been known under the name of `nicotiane' to Lery,he finds in Brazil under the name of `petun', the same nameby which it is called in Paraguay at present.  He believedthat `petun' and `nicotiane' were two different plants,but the only reason he adduces for his belief is that `nicotiane'was brought in his time from Florida, which, as he observes,is more than a thousand leagues from `Nostre Terre du Brezil'.His experience of savages was the same as that of Azara,and almost all early travellers, for he says:  `Nos Toupinambaoultsrec,oivent fort humainement les estrangers amis qui les vont visiter.'*Lery, however, seemed to think that, in spite of their pacific inclination,it was not prudent to put too much power in their hands, for he remarks:`Au reste parcequ'ils chargeyent, et remplisseyent leurs mousquetsjusques au bout . . . nous leurs baillions moitie/ (i.e., la poudre)de charbon broye/.'  This may have been a wise precaution,but he omits to state if the `charbon broye' was `bailli' at the same priceas good powder.  According to Azara, who takes his facts partlyfrom the contemporary writers -- Schmidel, Alvar Nunez,Ruy Diaz de Guzman, and Barco de la Centenera -- the Guaranis were dividedinto numerous tribes, as Imbeguas, Caracaras, Tembues, Colistines,and many others.  These tribes, though apparently of a common origin,never united, but each lived separately under its own chief.Their towns were generally either close to or in the middle of forests,or at the edge of rivers where there is wood.  They all cultivated pumpkins,beans, maize, mani (ground nuts), sweet potatoes, and mandioca;but they lived largely by the chase, and ate much wild honey.Diaz in his `Argentina' (lib. i., chap. i.) makes them cannibals.Azara believes this to have been untrue, as no traditions of cannibalismwere current amongst the Guaranis in his time, i.e., in 1789-1801.Liberal as Azara was, and careful observer of what he saw himself,I am disposed to believe the testimony of so many eye-witnessesof the customs of the primitive Guaranis, though none of themhad the advantage enjoyed by Azara of living three hundred yearsafter the conquest.  It may be, of course, that the powers of observationwere not so well developed in mankind in the beginning of the sixteenthas at the end of the eighteenth century, but this point I leave to thosewhose business it is to prove that the human mind is in a progressive state.However, Father Montoya, in his `Conquista Espiritual del Paraguay',affirms most positively that they used to eat their prisoners taken in war.'**--* Azara, in his `Descripcion y Historia del Paraguay', has a similar passage:  `Recibe bien todo Indio silvestre, al estrangero que viene de paz.'** `Por lo comun reparten pedazos de este cuerpo, del qual pedazo cozido   en mucha agua hacen unas gachas (`fritters') y es fiesta muy celebre   para ellos que hacen con muchas cerimonias.'--Their general characteristics seem to have been much the sameas those of other Indians of America.  For instance, they kepttheir hair and teeth to an extreme old age, their sight was keen,they seldom looked you in the face whilst speaking, and their dispositionwas cold and reserved.  The tone of their voices was low,so low that, as Azara says:  `La voz nunca es gruesa ni sonora,y hablan siempre muy bajo, sin gritar aun para quejarse si los matan;de manera que, si camina uno diez pasos delante, no le llamael que le necesita, sino que va a/ alcanzarle.'  This I have myself observedwhen travelling with Indians, even on horseback.There was one characteristic of the Guaranis in whichthey differed greatly from most of the Indian tribes in their vicinity,as the Indians of the Chaco and the Pampas, for all historians alike agreethat they were most unwarlike.  It is from this characteristicthat the Jesuits were able to make such a complete conquest of them,for, notwithstanding all their efforts, they never really succeededin permanently establishing themselves amongst any of the tribesin the Chaco or upon the Pampas.The name Guarani is variously derived.  Pedro de Angelis,in his `Coleccion de Obras y Documentos', derives it from `gua', paint,and `ni', sign of the plural, making the signification of the word`painted ones' or `painted men'.  Demersay, in his `Histoire du Paraguay',*thinks it probable that the word is an alteration of the word `guaranai',i.e., numerous.  Barco de la Centenera** (`Argentina', book i., canto i.)says the word means `hornet', and was applied on account of their savageness.Be that as it may, it is certain that the Guaranis did notat the time of the conquest, and do not now, apply the word to themselves,except when talking Spanish or to a foreigner.  The word `aba',Indian or man, is how they speak of their people, and to the languagethey apply the word `Abanee'.--* `Histoire du Paraguay et des E/tablissements des Je/suites',  L. Alfred Demersay, Paris, 1864.** `La Argentina', a long poem or rhyming chronicle contained   in the collection of `Historiadores Primitivos de Indias',   of Gonzales Barcia, Madrid, 1749.--In the same way the word `Paraguay' is variously derivedfrom a corruption of the word `Payagua' (the name of an Indian tribe),and `y', the Guarani word for water, meaning river of the Payaguas.Others, again, derive it from a Guarani word meaning `crown',and `y', water, and make it the crowned river, either from the palm-treeswhich crown its banks or the feather crowns which the Indians woreat the first conquest.  Others, again, derive it from a birdcalled paraqua (`Ortolida paraqua').  Again, Angelis, in his work`Serie de los Sen~ores Gobernadores del Paraguay' (lib. ii., p. 187),derives it from Paragua, the name of a celebrated Indian chiefat the time of the conquest.  What is certain is that `y'is the Guarani for water, and this is something in a derivation.`Y' is perhaps as hard to pronounce as the Gaelic `luogh', a calf,the nasal `gh' in Arabic, or the Kaffir clicks, having botha guttural and a nasal aspiration.*  It is rarely attempted with successby foreigners, even when long resident in the country.  Though Paraguaywas so completely the country of the Jesuits in after-times,they were not the first religious Order to go there.  Almost in every instancethe ecclesiastics who accompanied the first conquerors of Americawere Franciscans.  The Jesuits are said to have sent two prieststo Bahia in Brazil ten years after their Order was founded,but both in Brazil and Paraguay the Franciscans were before themin point of time.--* Lozano, in his `Historia del Paraguay', compares it to Greek,  but in my opinion fails to establish his case; but, then,  so few people know both Greek and Guarani.--San Francisco Solano, the first ecclesiastic who rose to much noteas a missionary, and who made his celebrated journey through the Chacoin 1588-89 from Peru to Paraguay, was a Franciscan.*  Thus, the Franciscanshad the honour of having the first American saint in their ranks.It is noteworthy, though, that he was recalled from Paraguay by his superiors,who seem to have had no very exalted opinion of him.--* He passed through the whole Chaco, descending the Pilcomayo  to its junction with the Paraguay, through territories but little explored  even to-day.  Perhaps the most complete description of the Chaco  is that of P. Lozano, with the following comprehensive title:  `Descripcion chorographica de Terreno Rios, Arboles, y Animales  de los dilatadisimas Provincias del Gran Chaco, Gualamba,  y de los Ritos y Costumbres de la inumerables naciones  barbaros e/ infideles que le habitan.  Con un cabal Relacion Historica  de lo que en ellos han obrado para conquistarlas algunos  Gobernadores y Ministros Reales, y los Misioneros Jesuitas  para reduc irlos a\ la fe del Verdadero Dios.'

Sumo de Tassa, as follows:  `Tassaron los sen~ores del Consejo  este libro a\ seis maravedis cada pliego.'  Palma, in the first `censura', says that he had read it several times  `con repetida complacencia', and that, though it was `breve en volumen'  (it has 484 quarto pages), that it was also short in its concise style,  kept closely to the rules of history, and was `muy copiosa en la doctrina'.--Charlevoix remarks (`History of Paraguay') `that it seems as if Providence,in granting him miraculous powers, had forgotten the other necessary stepsto make them effective.'  That he really had these powers seems strange,but San Francisco Solano narrates of himself that, in passing throughthe Chaco, he learned the languages of several of the tribes,and `preached to them in their own tongues of the birth, death,and transfiguration of Christ, the mysteries of the Trinity,Transubstantiation, and Atonement; that he explained to themthe symbols of the Church, the Papal succession from St. Peter downwards,and that he catechized the Indians by thousands, tens and hundredsof thousands, and that they came in tears and penitenceto acknowledge their belief.'Of course, to-day it is difficult to controvert these statements,even if inclined to do so; but the languages spoken by the Chaco Indiansare amongst the most difficult to learn of any spoken by the human race,so much so that Father Dobrizhoffer, in his `History of the Abipones',says `that the sounds produced by the Indians of the Chacoresembled nothing human, so do they sneeze, and stutter, and cough.'In such a language the Athanasian Creed itself would be puzzlingto a neophyte.He also says that several of the Jesuits who had labouredfor years amongst the Indians could never master their dialects,and when they preached the Indians received their wordswith shouts of laughter.  This the good priest attributed tothe presence of a `mocking devil' who possessed them.  It may bethat the mocking devil was but a sense of humour, the possession of which,even amongst good Christians, has been known to give offence.But be this as it may, San Francisco de Solano remained two years at Asuncion,though whilst he lived there his powers of speech (according to the Jesuits)seem to have been diminished, and he held no communication with the Indiansin their own languages.  It may be that, like St. Paul, he preferred to speak,when not with Indians, five words with his understandingrather than ten thousand in an unknown tongue.At the time of the first conquest Paraguay was almost entirely peopledby the Guarani race.*  It does not appear that their numberwas ever very great, perhaps not exceeding a millionin the whole country.  From the writings of Montoya, Guevara, Lozano,and the other missionaries of the time, it is certain that they had attainedto no very high degree of civilization, though they were certainlymore advanced than their neighbours in the Gran Chaco.It is most probable that they had not a single stone-built town,or even a house, or that such a thing existed south of New Granada,to the eastward of the Andes, for we may take the description in Schmidel's`History of the Casa del Gran Moxo'** either as a mistake or as a storywhich he had heard from some Peruvian Indian of the palaces of the Incas.At any rate, no remains of stone-built houses, still less of palaces,are known to have been found in Brazil or Paraguay.--* This race at one time spread from the Orinoco to the river Plate,  and even in the case of its offshoot, the Chiriguanas,  crossed to the west bank of the Paraguay.  Padre Ruiz Montoya,  in his `Conquista Espiritual del Paraguay', cap. i.,  speaking of the Guarani race, says:  `Domina ambos mares el del sur  por todo el Brasil y cin~iendo el Peru con los dos mas grandes rios  que conoce el orbe que son el de la Plata, cuya boca en Buenos-Ayres  es de ochenta leguas, y el gran Maran~on, a\ el inferior  en nada e que pasa bien vecino de la ciudad de Cuzco.'** Barco de la Centenera, in `La Argentina', canto v., also refers   to `La Casa del Gran Moxo'.  It was situated `en una laguna',   and was `toda de piedra labrada'.--To-day all the Guaranis who are still unconquered live in the impenetrableforests of the North of Paraguay or in the Brazilian province of Matto Grosso.Their limits to the south extend to near the ruined missionsof Jesus and Trinidad.  By preference, they seem to dwellabout the sources of the Igatimi, an affluent of the Parana,and in the chain of mountains known either as San Jose or Mbaracayu.The Paraguayans generally refer to them as Monteses (dwellers in the woods),and sometimes as Caaguas.  They present almost the same characteristicsas they did at the discovery of the country, and wander in the woodsas the Jesuits describe them as doing three hundred years ago.Olive in colour, rather thickly set, of medium height, thin beards,and generally little hair upon the body, their type has remained unchanged.The difference in stature amongst the Guaranis is less noticeablethan amongst Europeans.  Their language is poorer than the Guarani spokenby the Paraguayans, and the pronunciation both more nasal and guttural.Their numerals only extend to four, as was the caseat the time of the discovery.*--* Their numerals are four in number (`petei^, mocoi^, mbohapi=, ira^ndi=');  after this they are said to count in Spanish in the same way  as do the Guarani-speaking Paraguayans.  Much has been written  on the Guarani tongue by many authors, but perhaps the `Gramatica',  `Tesoro', and the `Vocabulario' of Padre Antonio Ruiz Montoya,  published at Madrid in 1639 and 1640, remain the most important works  on the language.  Padre Sigismundi has left a curious work in Guarani  on the medicinal plants of Paraguay.  Before the war of 1866-70  several MS. copies were said to exist in that country.  See Du Gratz's `Re/publique du Paraguay', cap. iv., p. 214.--Like their forefathers, they seldom unite in large numbers,and pay little honour or obedience to their chiefs, who differ in no respect,either in arms, dress, or position, from the ordinary tribesmen.In Brazil they are confined to the southern portion of the provinceof San Paulo, and are called by the Brazilians Bugres -- that is, slaves.A more unfitting name it would have been impossible to hit upon,as all efforts to civilize them have proved abortive, and to-daythey still range the forests, attacking small parties of travellers,and burning isolated farm-houses.  The Brazilians assertthat they are cannibals, but little is known positively as to this.What has altered them so entirely from the original Guaranisof the time of the conquest, who were so easily subdued,it is hard to conjecture.  One thing is certain:  that the example given themby the Christian settlers has evidently not been such as to induce themto leave their wild life and enter into the bonds of civilization.Diaz, in the `Argentina', thinks the Caribs of the West Indieswere Guaranis, and the Jesuits often refer to them under that name.*This point would be easily set at rest by examining if any Guarani wordsremain in the dialect of the Caribs of the Mosquito coast.As to their relative numbers at the time of the foundation of the missions,it is most difficult to judge.  At no one time does the populationof the thirty towns seem to have exceeded one hundred and thirty thousand.--* See Demersay, `Histoire du Paraguay', p. 324, for names of Guarani tribes.  Alfred Maury also, in his `La Terre et l'Homme Ame/ricain', p. 392,  speaks of `le rameau brasilio-guaranin, ou Cara/ibe, qui s'etendait  jadis depuis les Petites-Antilles jusqu'au Paraguay.'--D'Orbigny in his `L'Homme Americain', estimates the Guaranis of Brazilat one hundred and fifty thousand.Humboldt cites two hundred and sixty-nine thousand as the probable numberof Indians of every kind in the Brazilian Empire.The Viscount de Itabayana (a Brazilian writer) fixes the numberat two hundred and fifty thousand to three hundred thousand.Veloso de Oliveira puts it at eight hundred thousand;and later statisticians range between one million five hundred thousandand seven to eight hundred thousand.The numbers given of Indians by the Spanish conquerors are almost alwaysgrossly overstated, from the wish they not unnaturally hadto magnify the importance of their conquests and to enhance their exploitsin the eyes of those for whom they wrote.Struck by the tractable character of the Guaranis, Mendoza beganto build a fort on August 15, 1537 (which is the day of the Assumption),and the name he gave to his fort was Asuncion, which afterwards becamethe capital of Paraguay.Espinosa returned to Corpus Christi, and afterwards to Buenos Ayres,where a small force had still remained.  This force,tired of the ceaseless battles with the Querandis, or Pampa Indians,embarked for Asuncion.Irala, after waiting for many months at Fort Olimpo, returned to Asuncion,where he found Ruiz de Galan acting as Governor.  A dispute at once arosebetween them, and Irala, after having been imprisoned, was allowed to returnto Fort Olimpo.  Here he found the Payagua Indians in rebellion,and in the battle which ensued he is reported to have slain seven of themwith his own hand.*  He still maintained a fitful search for Juan de Ayolas,but without success.--* Few modern `conquerors' in Africa seem to have engaged in personal combat  with the natives.  Even of Mr. Rhodes it is not set down  that he has killed many Matabele with his own hands.  Times change,  not always for the bettering of things.--Galan returned to Buenos Ayres, and, stopping at Corpus Christi,took occasion to fall upon the friendly and unsuspecting Timbu Indiansand massacre a quantity of them.  Why he did so is quite uncertain,for the Timbues had been in the habit of supplying the fort of Corpus Christiwith provisions; it may be that the quality of the provisions was inferior,but neither Ruiz Diaz nor Schmidel informs us on the point.Galan, after his `victory', re-embarked for Buenos Ayres,leaving Antonio de Mendoza in command with a hundred men.One day, when about the half of the force was hunting,the Indians fell upon it and cut it off to the last man;but for the opportune arrival of two vessels the fort would havebeen destroyed.  However, many Spaniards were slain, and Antonio de Mendozaamongst them.After this battle, in which Santiago* is said to have appearedon the top of the principal tower of the fort dressed in whitewith a drawn sword in his hand, Galan and Espinosa returned to Asuncion,taking with them the remainder of the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres.At Asuncion they found that Irala had again returnedwithout having discovered traces of Ayolas.  Irala was elected Governorunder a clause in the royal letters patent which providedfor the case of Ayolas not returning.  His first act was to orderthe complete evacuation of Buenos Ayres.  An Italian vessel, which wasgoing to Peru with colonists, having been driven into the river Plate,united with the remains of the colonists at Buenos Ayres and proceededto Asuncion.--* Santiago, as in duty bound, usually appeared whenever Spaniards  were hard pressed.  Few writers had the courage of Bernal Diaz,  who of a similar appearance said:  `But I, sinner that I was,  was not worthy to see him; whom I did see and recognise  was Francisco de Morla on his chestnut horse' (Bernal Diaz,  `Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espan~a', cap. xxxiv., p. 141;  Madrid, 1795).--Curiously enough, the remnants of several expeditions thus joinedto found the first permanent city in the territories of the river Plate;not at Buenos Ayres, but a thousand miles away in the interior of the country,where it seemed little probable that their attempt would prove successful.To preside over the heterogeneous elements of which Asuncion was composed,Domingo Martinez de Irala was chosen.  He was a Biscayan,a member of that ancient race which neither Romans nor Moors were ever ableto subdue.  Nothing is known about his antecedents.  Not improbablyhe was a son of one of the innumerable small gentlemen with whomthe Basque provinces used to swarm.  Almost every house in the little townseven to-day has its coat of arms over the door.  Every inhabitantclaimed to be a nobleman, and in the reign of Charles V. they furnishedmany soldiers of repute in the wars of Europe and America.The system of Irala was to conciliate rather than subdue the natives.Isolated from help of every kind, the length of the voyage from Spainprecluding all idea of speedy succour in a rebellion, it was the only coursehe could pursue.From the very first he encouraged the soldiers to marry women of the country,thus creating ties which bound them to the land.Two Franciscan friars* set about at once to learn the languageand preach to the people.  They also seem to have endeavouredto reduce the Guarani language to writing.  So, from several circumstances,the early history of Paraguay was very different from that of every otherSpanish possession in America.  To all the others Spanish womenseem to have gone in greater or in smaller numbers.  To Paraguay,at the foundation of Asuncion, it seems that hardly any women went.--* Thus it will be seen that the Franciscans were at work in the country  long before the arrival of the Jesuits.  It may be on this account  that they became such bitter enemies of the later comers.--So there a different state of society arose to that, for example,in Chile or in Mexico.  In both those countries few Spaniards ever marriednative women.  Those who did so were either members of the highest class-- who sometimes, but rarely, married Indian women of positionfrom motives of policy -- or else the lowest class of Spaniards;in this case, after a generation, their children becamepractically Indians.  In Paraguay it was quite the contrary,and the grandchildren of Indian mothers and Spanish fatherswere almost reckoned Spaniards, and the next generation always so.Washburne, in his `History of Paraguay' (p. 32, cap. i., vol. i.),points out the contrast between the effects of the treatment meted outby Penn to the Indians in Pennsylvania and that by Irala in Paraguay.Where, he asks, are the Indian tribes with whom the celebrated Quaker treated?In Paraguay, on the other hand, at least in the time when Washburnewas Minister from the United States to Lopez (from 1861 to 1868),the few remaining Paraguayans of the upper class were almost all descendedfrom the intermarriages of the followers of Irala with the natives.The tyranny of Lopez, and the effects of the disastrous warwith Brazil and the Argentine Republic, have almost extirpatedevery Paraguayan (of the old stock) with the least pretensionsto white descent.Ruiz Diaz de Guzman, speaking of the mixed race in Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,says:`They are generally good soldiers, of great spirit and valour,expert in the use of arms, especially in that of the musquet,so much so that, when they go on long journeys, they are accustomedto live on the game which they kill with it.  It is common for themto kill birds on the wing, and he is accounted unfit for a soldierwho cannot bring down a pigeon.  They are such excellent horsementhat there is no one who is not able to tame and ride an unbroken colt.`The women generally are virtuous, beautiful, and of a gentle disposition.'If the inhabitants of Paraguay and the river Plate of those dayswere good marksmen, it is more than can be said of the Gauchosof the Argentine provinces and the Paraguayans of twenty years ago.Without military training, so far from being able to bring down a pigeonon the wing, few could hit the trunk of a tree at fifty paces.The usual method of shooting used to be to cram as much ammunitioninto the gun as the hand would contain, and then, looking carefully awayfrom the object aimed at, to close both eyes and pull the trigger.Accuracy of aim was not so much considered as loudness of report.As regards their powers of riding, they are still unchanged;and as to the virtue of their women, virtue is so largelya matter of convention that it is generally wisest to leavesuch matters uncommented on, as it is so easy not to understandthe conventions of the people of whom one writes.Whilst Irala was conciliating the Guaranis in Paraguay, Charles V. hadnot forgotten that the new settlement of Buenos Ayres had been abandoned.After much search, he selected Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vacato be the new Governor; and, as Alvar Nunez was perhapsthe most remarkable of all the Spanish `conquistadores' of the New World,it may not be out of place to give some facts of his career,as his policy in regard to the Indians was almost that of the Jesuitsin after-times.As he himself informs us in his Commentaries,* his `father was thatPedro de Vera who won Canaria,' and his mother `Dona Teresa Cabeza de Vaca,a noble lady of Jerez de la Frontera.'  After the Spanish fashion of the time,he used the names of both his parents.--* `Comentarios de Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca'.  Published by  Don Andres Gonzalez Barcia in his collection of `Early Historians  of the Indies' (Madrid, 1749).--In 1529 he sailed with the ill-fated expedition of Panfilo de Narvaezto Apalache in Florida, was shipwrecked, tried to regainthe Spanish settlements in boats, and then cast by a storm absolutely naked,and with only three companions, upon an unknown land.  Taken by the Indians,he was made a slave, then rose to be a pedlar, then a doctor,and finally a chief, held sacred for his mysterious powers.At last he made his way on foot into the territory of New Spain,not as a captive, but as the leader of several hundred Indians,who followed him and did his bidding as if he had been born their chief.Rambling about for months, but always followed by his Indians,he at length encountered a Spanish horse-soldier, and, accosting him,found he had almost forgotten Spanish during his ten years' sojournwith the Indians.  His first entreaty, when he found Spanishgradually returning to him, was to the Spaniards not to harasshis Indian following.  Then he besought the Indians themselvesto cease their nomad life and cultivate the soil.  In neither casewas he successful, as the Spaniards, like all other Europeans,held Indians little removed from dogs.  And for the Indians,the few remaining are as much attached to their old wandering life as inthe days of the discovery of the New World.  In all that Alvar Nunez writes,he shows a grandeur of soul and spirit far different from the writings,not only of the conquerors of the New World, but of the conquerors of Africaof to-day.  For him no bragging of his exploits.*1*  All that he sayshe sets down modestly and with excuses (as every now and then,`Me pesa hablar de mis trabajos'), and as befits a gentleman.Lastly, he leaves the reader (when describing his captivity in Florida),by telling him quite quietly and without comment that God was pleased to savefrom all these perils himself, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andres Dorantes,and that the fourth was a negro called Estevanico, a native of Azimur.But, not contented with his ten years' captivity, after three years at homehe entered into a certain `asiento'*2* and `capitulacion'*3* with the Kingto sail at his own charges with an expedition to succourDon Pedro de Mendoza, who was hard pressed by famine and the Indiansat Buenos Ayres.  He agreed to furnish eight thousand ducats,horses, arms, men, and provisions at his own expense, upon conditionthat he was made Governor and Adelantado of the Rio de la Plata,and General both of its armies and its fleets.--*1* It must be allowed, however, that in their writings    few of the Spanish `conquistadores' of America bragged much.    They mostly gave the credit of all their doings to the God of Battles.    The boasting has been reserved for the conquerors of Africa    in our own time.*2* `Asiento' is a contract.  The contract which Charles V.,    at the well-meant but unfortunate instigation of Las Casas,    made with the Genoese to supply negroes for America    is known as `El Asiento de los Negros'.*3* In the `capitulacion' made by Alvar Nunez with the King    occurs the celebrated clause, `Que no pasasen procuradores ni abogados    a las Indias', i.e., that neither solicitors nor barristers should go    to the Indies.  It is unfortunate it was not held to stringently,    as in Paraguay, at least, the Reptilia were already well represented.--Upon November 2, 1537, he embarked at Cadiz with his fleet,consisting of a caravel and two full-rigged ships.  All went wellup to the Cape de Verdes.  On nearing the equator, it occurredto the `Maestro del Agua' to examine his stock of water,and, out of one hundred pipes which had been put aboard, he foundbut three remaining, and from these the thirty horses and four hundred menwho were on board all had to drink.  Seeing the greatness of the necessity,the Governor -- for Alvar Nunez almost always speaks of himselfin the third person -- gave orders that the fleet should make for land.`Three days,' he says in his Commentaries, `we sailed in search of it';and on the fourth, just before sunrise, occurred a very notable affair,and, as it is not altogether `fuera de proposito', I set it down,and it is this -- `that, going towards the land, the ships had almost touchedon some sharp rocks we had not seen.'  Then, as now, I take it,vigilance was not a noticeable quality in Spanish sailors.Just as the vessels were almost on the rocks, `a cricket commenced to sing,which cricket a sick soldier had put into the ship at Cadiz, being anxiousto hear its music, and for the two months which our navigation had enduredno one had heard it, whereat the soldier was much enraged;and as on that morning it felt the land [`sintio la tierra'],it commenced to sing, and its music wakened all the people of the ship,who saw the cliffs, which were distant almost a crossbow-shotfrom where we were, so we cast out anchors and saved the ship,and it is certain that if the cricket had not sung all of us,four hundred soldiers and thirty horses, had been lost.'  Some of the crewaccepted the occurrence as a miracle from God; but Nunez himselfis silent on that head, being a better observer of natural historythan a theologian.  But `from there, and sailing more than a hundred leaguesalong the coast, the cricket every evening gave us his music,and thus with it we arrived at a little port beyond Cape Frio,where the Adelantado landed and unfurled his flag, and took possessionfor His Majesty.'  The expedition disembarked at Santa Catalina in Brazil.`There the Governor landed his men and twenty-six of the horseswhich had escaped the sea, all that remained of forty-six embarked in Spain.'The `odium theologicum' gave the Governor some work at once.Two friars -- Fray Bernardo de Armenta and Fray Alonso Lebron, Franciscans --had burnt the houses of some Indians, who had retaliatedin the heathen fashion by slaughtering two Christians.The `people being scandalized', the Governor sent for the friars,admonished them, and told them to restrain their zeal.This was the first false step he made, and set all friars and prieststhroughout America against him.  Hearing at Santa Catalinathat Buenos Ayres was almost abandoned, and that the inhabitants had foundedthe town of Asuncion del Paraguay, Alvar determined to march thither by land,and send his ship into the river Plate and up the Paraguay.The two Franciscan friars he told to remain and `indoctrinate' the Indians.This they refused to do, saying they wished to reside amongstthe Spaniards in Asuncion.  Had they been Jesuits, it is ten to onethey had remained and spent their lives `indoctrinating',for the Jesuits alone of all the religious Orders were ever readyto take every risk.Upon his march the Governor, contrary to all good policy and precedent,ordered that nothing should be taken from the Indians without due paymentbeing made.  To insure this being done, he paid for all provisions himself,and served them out to the soldiery.  This made him as unpopularwith his soldiers as his dealings with the two Franciscans had made himamongst the friars.  Surely he might have known that Pizarro, Cortes,Almagro, and the rest, were men who never paid for anything.Still, he persisted in his conduct to the end, and so brought ruin on himself.The Indians seemed to appreciate his method, for he says that `when the newswas spread abroad of the good treatment the Governor gave to all,they came to meet the army decked with flowers and bringing provisionsin great abundance.'  It was, he also says, `a thing to seehow frightened the Indians were of the horses, and how they brought them food,chickens and honey to keep them quiet and in good humour,and they asked the Governor to tell the horses not to hurt them.'After passing the river Iguazu, he sent the two friars aheadto collect provisions, and `when the Governor arrived the Indians hadno more to give.'*--* This is perhaps the first account of the levying of the tithe  in the New World.--So having started from the coast upon November 2, 1541, he arrived at Asuncionon March 2, 1542, having accomplished a march of more than two thousand mileswith but the loss of a single man and without the slaughterof a single Indian.  Hardly had he arrived at Asuncion before he found himselfembroiled on every side.  The Indians were in full rebellion,the settlement of Buenos Ayres almost in ruins, and the officersappointed by the King to collect the royal dues all hostile to him to a man.After having consulted with the clergy to find if they thought it lawfulto attack the Guaycurus who had assailed the newly-founded town,he received the opinion `that it was not only lawful, but expedient.'Therefore he sent off an expedition against them, to which was joined a priestto require the Guaycurus to become Christians and to acknowledgethe King of Spain.  The propositions, not unnaturally,did not seem reasonable to the Indians, who most likelywere unaware of the benefits which Christianity confers,and probably heard for the first time of the King of Spain.The Governor, who seems to have doubted of the humanity of the clergy,called another council, which confirmed the previous opinion.Strangely enough, this seems to have surprised him, for he probablydid not reflect that the clergy would not have to fight themselves,and that the first blood ever spilt on earth was on accountof a religious difference.Just before the expedition started it was found that the two Franciscan friarswho had come with him from Santa Catalina could not be found.It then appeared they had started back to the coastaccompanied by a bevy of Indian damsels, thirty-five in all.They were followed and brought back, and then explainedthat they were on their way to Spain to complain against the Governor.The five-and-thirty dusky catechumens remained without an explanation,and the people were once more `scandalized'.  The Governor then started outagainst the Guaycurus.  Only those who know the Chaco,or western bank of the river Paraguay, can form the least idea of whatsuch an expedition must have been.  Even to-day in the Chacothe change since the beginning of the world can be but slight.As a steamer slips along the bank, nothing for miles and miles is seenbut swamp, intersected with backwaters,*1* in which lie alligators,electric eels, and stinging rays.  Far as the eye can reachare swamps, swamps, and more swamps, a sea of waving pampa-grass.After the swamps thickets of tacuaras (canes), forests of thorny trees,chanares, nandubay, jacarandas, urundey, talas, and quebrachos,each one hard enough to split an axe, some, like the black canela,almost like iron; the inhabitants ferocious and intractable as whenthe Governor himself first saw them; the climate heavy and humid, the air dankwith vinchucas*2* and mosquitoes and the little black infernal midgetcalled the jejen; no roads, no paths, no landmarks, but here and thereat intervals of many leagues a clearing in the forestwhere some straggling settlement exists, more rarely stillthe walls of a deserted Jesuit mission-house or church.  Ostriches and deer,tigers,*3* capibaras and tapirs, and now and then a herd of cattleas wild as buffaloes, are seen.  Sometimes an Indian with his lancesits motionless upon his horse to watch the vessel pass --a sentinel to guard the wilderness from encroachments from without.So Alvar Nunez, as he tells us in his Commentaries, started withfour hundred men and with one thousand friendly Indians,all well armed and painted, and with plates of metal on their headsto reflect the sun, and so strike terror to their enemies.To save the horses they were put on board,*4* whilst the Indiansmarched along the bank, keeping up with the ships.  Horses at that timein Paraguay and in Peru often were worth one thousand crowns of gold,though Azara tells us that in the last century in Buenos Ayresyou could often buy a good horse for two needles, so cheap had they become.Then, as at present, time was of no account in Paraguay, so almost every daythey landed the horses to keep them in condition and to chasethe ostriches and deer.--*1* These backwaters are known in Guarani by the name of `aguapey'.*2* The vinchuca is a kind of flying bug common in Paraguay.    Its shape is triangular, its colour gray, and its odour noxious.    It is one of the Hemiptera, and its so-called scientific appellation    is `Conorhinus gigas'.*3* R. B. Cunninghame Graham writes elsewhere:  "All over South America    the jaguar is called a tiger (tigre)."  -- A. L., 1998.*4* Azara, in his `Historia del Paraguay', etc., tells us that in 1551    Domingo de Irala at Asuncion bought a fine black horse    for five thousand gold crowns.  He bound himself to pay for him    out of the proceeds of his first conquest.--Just the kind of army that a thinking man would like to march with;not too much to eat, but, still, a pleasant feeling of marchingto spread religion and to make one's fortune, with but the solitaryunpleasant feature to the soldier -- the system of payment for provisionswhich the Governor prescribed.  All was new and strange; the world wasrelatively young.  Each night the Governor religiously wrote up his diary,now chronicling the death of some good horse, or of an Indian,or commenting upon the fruits, the fish, the animals, the trees,and `all the other things of God which differ from those in the Castiles.'Occasionally a fight took place with Guasarapos or with Pagayuas,but nothing of much account (`de mucha monta'); always the tales of gold-minesto be met with further on.  Eventually the expedition came to a pointnot far from where is now the town of Corumba.  There Alvar Nunez foundeda town to which he gave the name of Reyes, which has long fallen into decay.He also sent two captains to explore and search for gold,waiting two or three months for their return, and suffering froma quartan ague which confined him to his bed; then, having failed to findthe talked-of gold-mines, he set his face again towards Asuncion.Just before starting he gave the final blow to his waning popularity.Some of his followers, having taken Indian girls, had hidden themon board the ships; this, when he knew it, Nunez at once forbade,and, sending for the fathers of the girls, restored their children to them.`With this,' he says, `the natives were much pleased, but the Spaniardsrendered angry and desperate, and for this cause they hated me.'Nothing more natural, and for the same cause the Spanish Paraguayanshated the Jesuits who carried out the policy which the wise Governor began.On April 8, 1543, the Governor returned to Asuncion,worn out and ill with ague.  There he found all confusion.  Domingo de Irala,a clever, ambitious Biscayan soldier who had been interim Governorbefore Nunez had arrived, had worked upon the people,saying that Nunez wished to take away their property.As their chief property was in Indians whom they had enslaved,this rendered Nunez most unpopular, and the same kind of allegationswere laid against him as were laid against the Jesuitswhen in their turn they denounced slavery in Paraguay.All the complaints were in the name of liberty, as generally is the casewhen tyranny or villainy of any sort is to be done.So Alvar Nunez*1* tells us in his Commentaries that at the hourof the Ave Maria ten or twelve of the `factious' entered his housewhere he lay ill in bed, all shouting `Liberty!' and to provethey were all good patriots one Jaime Resquin put a bent crossbow to his side,and forced him to get out of bed, and took him off to prisonamid a crowd all shouting `Liberty!'  The friends of liberty(upon the other side) attempted a rescue, but the patriots*2* were too strong.So the unpatriotic Governor was thrown, heavily ironed, into a cell,out of which to make room they let a murderer who was awaiting death.`He' (Alvar Nunez grimly remarks) `made haste to take my cloak,and then set off down the street at once, calling out "Liberty!"'That everything should be in order, the patriots confiscatedall the Governor's goods and took his papers, publishing a proclamationthat they did so because he was a tyrant.  Unluckily, the Indianshave not left us any commentaries, or it would be curious to learnwhat they thought as to the tyranny of Alvar Nunez.  Most probablythey thought as the Indians of the Jesuit missions thoughtat the expulsion of the Jesuits from Paraguay, as is set forthin the curious memorial addressed in 1768 by the peopleof the Mission of San Luis to the Governor of Buenos Ayres,praying that the Jesuits might be suffered to remain instead of the friars,who had been sent to replace them against the people's will.*3*Having got the Governor into prison, the patriots had to elect another chief,and the choice naturally `fell' upon Domingo de Irala, who, having beeninterim Governor, had never ceased intriguing from the first.He promptly put his friends in office, after the fashion of all Governors,whether they enter office to the cry of `Liberty' or not.The friends of Alvar Nunez, in the usual Spanish fashion(long sanctified by use and wont), declared themselves in opposition --that is, they roamed about the land, proving by theft and murderthat their love of liberty was just as strong as that of those in power.Things shortly came to such a pass that no one could leave his house by night.The marauding Guaycurus burnt all the suburbs, and threatenedto attack the town.  Nunez himself was guarded day and nightby four men armed with daggers in a close prison.  As he says himself,his prison was not `fitting for his health,' for day and nighthe had to keep a candle burning to see to read, and the grass grewunderneath his bed, whilst for the sake of `health' he hada pair of first-rate fetters on his feet.  For his chief gaolerthey procured one Hernando de Sosa, whom Nunez had put in gaolfor striking an Indian chief.  A guard watched constantly at the prison gate,but, still, in spite of this he managed to communicate almost uninterruptedlywith his friends outside.  His method was certainly ingenious.His food was brought to him by an Indian girl, whom, so greatwas the fear of the patriots that he should write to the King,they made walk naked into the prison, carrying the dishes,and with her head shaved.  Notwithstanding this, she managed to bringa piece of paper hidden between her toes.  The party of Liberty,suspecting that Nunez was communicating with his friends,procured an Indian youth to make love to the girl and learn the secret.This he failed to do, owing, perhaps, to his love-makingbeing wanting in conviction on account of her shaved head.At last Irala and his friends determined to send the Governor a prisonerto Spain, taking care, of course, to despatch a messenger beforehandto distort the facts and prejudice the King.  The friends of Nunez, however,managed to secrete a box of papers, stating the true facts, on board the ship.At dead of night a band of harquebusiers dragged him from his bed(after a captivity of eleven months), as he says, `almost with the candlein his hand' -- i.e., in a dying state.  As he left the prison,he fell upon his knees and thanked God for having let him once morefeel the air of heaven, and then in a loud voice exclaimed:`I name as my successor Captain Juan de Salazar de Espinosa.'At this one Garci Vargas rushed at him with a knife, and told himto recall his words or he would kill him instantly.  This he was stoppedfrom doing, and Nunez was hurried to the ship and chained securelyto a beam.  On board the vessel, he says, they tried to poison him;but this seems doubtful, as there was nothing on earthto prevent their doing so had they been so inclined.Still, as a prudent man he took the precaution to providesome oil and a piece of unicorn (`pedazo de unicornio'),with which he tried the food.  Unicorns he could not have seen in Paraguay,nor yet in Florida, and he does not explain how he became so luckily equipped.--*1* `Comentarios de Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca', contained in Barcia's    `Historiadores Primitivos de las Indias Occidentales'.*2* The `patriots' are always those of the prevailing party in a State.*3*                               `(I.H.S.)    `God preserve your Excellency, say we, the Cabildo,    and all the Caciques and Indians, men, women and children of San Luis,    as your Excellency is our father.  The Corregidor,    Santiago Pindo and Don Pantaleon Caynari, in their love for us,    have written to us of certain birds which they desire we will send them    for the King. . . .  We are sorry not to have them to send,    inasmuch as they live where God made them, in the forests,    and fly far away from us, so that we cannot catch them.    Withal we are the vassals of God and of the King, and always desirous    to fulfil the wishes of his Minister . . . so we pray to God    that that best of birds, the Holy Ghost, may descend upon the King. . . .    Furthermore, we desire to say that the Spanish custom    is not to our liking -- for everyone to take care of himself,    instead of helping one another in their daily toil.'    This quaint and touching letter was written originally in Guarani,    and is preserved at Buenos Ayres.  `That best of birds,    the Holy Ghost,' shows faith grounded, at least, on ornithology,    and the whole spirit of the simple document is as pathetic    as its unconscious philosophy is true.--None the less, of all the discoverers of America he is the man of leastimaginative power -- that is, in matters appertaining to natural history --so one must conclude he had his piece of unicorn from Spain,where he most probably had bought it from some dealer in necessariesfor travellers to the New World.After a stormy voyage he arrived in Spain to find his accusersjust before him.  With truly Eastern justice, both accusers and accusedwere put in gaol, a custom worthy of adoption in other lands.Nunez was soon released on bail, and, his accusers having all died,in eight years' time he was triumphantly acquitted of all the charges broughtagainst him.  To prove, however, that Justice is and always has been blind,the King never restored him to his government in Paraguay, and,as Nunez says, forgot to repay him what he had expended in his service.*With Alvar Nunez was lost the only chance of liberal treatmentto the Indians, for from his time the governors, instead of beingmen of the world above the petty spite of party differences,were chosen either from officers who, having served in the frontier wars,quite naturally looked on the Indians as enemies, or were appointedby intriguing Ministers at Court.  From the death of Alvar Nunezto the inauguration of the missions by the Jesuits,no one arose to take the Indians' side, and it may bethat had his policy prevailed there would have been an Indian population leftin the mission territory of Paraguay; for had the civil governorsco-operated with the Jesuits, the dispersion of the Indians,which took place at the expulsion of the Jesuits, had not occurred.--* Guevara, `Historia del Paraguay' (printed in `La Coleccion de Angelis',  Buenos Aires, 1836), book vi., p. 108, says of Alvar Nunez:  `Merecia estatua por su rectitud, justicia y Christiandad.'  And in  another place Guevara says:  `La Florida lo cautivo/ con inhumanidad;  La Asuncion lo aprisiono/ con infamia; pero en una y otro parte  fue ejemplar de moderacion . . . recto, prudente y de sano corazon.'  Alvar Nunez died holding the office of `Oidor de la Audiencia de Sevilla',  according to P. del Techo (`Historia del Paraguay');  or as a member of the Consejo de Indias, according to Charlevoix.--Thus was Domingo Martinez de Irala left in sole command in Paraguay.He naturally had all to gain by not communicating with Spain.Had he done so, the part he played in reference to Alvar Nunezmust have been known.  He had, however, certain good qualities,courage in abundance, Herculean strength and great endurance,and the power of making himself obeyed.  But he had to justify himselfto Spain for his position, and the surest way to do sowas to discover gold-mines.  So, naming Francisco de Mendozahis lieutenant, he started up the Paraguay, taking with himthree hundred and fifty soldiers and two thousand Guaranis.After many hardships, he reached the frontiers of Peru,only to find the country already conquered from the Pacific side,and to be met by the messengers of the wise President, La Gasca,who told him to return, and named one Diego Centeno Governor of Paraguayinstead of him.  Centeno died before he could assume the governorship,so it seemed that fate determined that Irala was to continue in command.After a year and a half he returned to Paraguay, having foundno gold or riches, but bringing many thousand Indians as slaves.It is important to remember that Irala, who was remarkablefor his relatively kind treatment of the Indians, on this occasionled so many of them captive.  On arriving at Asuncion he founda rebellion going on, as not infrequently occurred when a Spanish Governorleft his domains.  His lieutenant, Mendoza, had been killedby one Diego de Abreu.  After quieting matters in Asuncion,he despatched Nuflo de Chaves (one of his captains) to found a townon the higher waters of the Paraguay.Like many other captains of those days, the idea of Chaves was to make himselfquite independent of authority; so, striking into the interior,he founded the town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia.After many adventures he was killed by an Indian, who struck him with a clubwhilst he was sitting eating without his helmet.Irala died at the little village of Ita in 1557, and was buriedin the cathedral at Asuncion, which he was building at the time.With him expired the generation of the conquering soldiers of fortune,who, schooled in the wars of Italy, brought to Americasome of the virtues and all the vices of the Old World.After him began the reign of the half-caste Spaniards who werethe progenitors of the modern occupants of the Spanish-American republics.At Irala's death the usual feuds, which have for the last three hundred yearsdisgraced every part of Spanish America, began.  Into them it is unnecessaryto enter, for with Irala died almost the only Governor of Paraguaywho showed the smallest capacity to make himself obeyed.True indeed that Arias de Saavedra, a native of Paraguayand Lieutenant-Governor under Ramirez de Velasco, the Governor of Tucuman,displayed some traces of ability and of intelligence.  He it waswho first appealed to Spain for missionaries to convert the Indians.Whilst Alvar Nunez and Irala, with Nuflo de Chaves and the other captains,had been conquering and building towns, the Jesuits had beenpreaching in the wilderness and gathering together the Indian tribes.Not ten years after the foundation of their Order,* or about 1550,they had landed at San Salvador de Bahia in Brazil.--* Acquaviva was General of the Order at this time; he was a man  of marked ability and great energy.--In 1554, in the district of Guayra, on the upper waters of the Parana,and above the cataract, the towns of Ontiveros, Ciudad Real, and Villa Rica,had been founded by Don Ruy Diaz de Melgarejo.In 1586 Fathers Alfonso Barcena and Angulo left the town of Santa Mariade las Charcas (Bolivia) at the request of Francisco Vitoria,Bishop of Santiago, who had appealed for missionaries to the Society of Jesus.They reached the province of Guayra, and began their labours.Shortly afterwards they were joined by Fathers Estezan Grao,Juan Solano, and Thomas Fields; Solano and Fields had already visitedsome of the wandering tribes upon the Rio Vermejo in the Chaco.In 1593 others arrived, as Juan Romero, Gaspar de Monroy,and Marcelino Lorenzana.  Shortly after this they foundedthe college in Asuncion.  Then Fathers Ortega and Vellarnao penetratedinto the mountains of the Chiriguanas, and began to preach the Gospelto the Indians.In 1602 Acquaviva, seeing the necessity of common action,called all the scattered Jesuits of Paraguay and the river Plateto a conference at Salta to deliberate as to their future policy.*  In 1605Father Diego Torres was named Provincial of the Jesuits of Paraguay and Chile,thus proving both the paucity of Jesuits in South America at the time,and the little idea the General in Rome had of the immensity of the countrieshe was dealing with.--* Before this date the Jesuits in Paraguay had been under  the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishops of Peru.--Torres arrived in Lima with fifteen priests, and almost at the same timesome others arrived at Buenos Ayres; both parties proceeded to Paraguay.Already the Jesuits found themselves a prey to calumny.Both in Tucuman and Paraguay they were expected to lend themselvesto the enslavement of the Indians.  In Chile Father Valdiviawas expelled from Santiago, and took refuge at Tucuman.  There he foundthe condition of affairs so intolerable that he went to Madridto solicit the protection of the King, Philip III., for his Indian subjects.In 1608 Philip issued his royal letters patent to the Society of Jesusfor the conversion of the Indians in the province of Guayra.The Bishop and the Governor, Arias de Saavedra (himself a Paraguayanby birth), offered no objection, and the scheme of colonizationwas agreed upon at once.Thus the Jesuits obtained their first official status in America.Fathers Simon Maceta and Jose Cataldino (both Italians)left Asuncion on October 10, 1609, and arrived in February, 1610,on the banks of the river Paranapane.*--* Paranapane = the White Parana, or, according to others,  the Parana without fish.--There they met the Indians amongst whom Fields and Ortegahad begun to labour, and there they founded the Reduction* of Loreto,the first permanent establishment instituted by the Jesuitsamongst the Guaranis.  Thus, in the woods of Paraguay,upon a tributary of the Parana but little known even to-day,did the Society of Jesus lay the first foundation of their famous missions.But little more than fifty years from the foundation of their Order,thus had they penetrated to what was then, and is perchance to-day,after their missions all are ruined, one of the remotest corners of the world.--* Reduction (`reduccion') was the Spanish name for a missionary establishment.--There they built up the system with which their name is linked for ever-- the system which for two hundred years was able to hold togetherwandering Indian tribes, restless as Arabs, suspicious aboveevery other race of men -- and which to-day has disappeared,leaving nothing of a like nature in all the world.Chapter II  Early days of the missions -- New settlements founded --  Relations of Jesuits with Indians and Spanish colonists --  Destruction of missions by the Mamelucos -- Father Maceta --  Padre Antonio Ruiz de Montoya -- His work and influence --  Retreat of the Jesuits down the ParanaIt does not seem doubtful but that the work done by Fathers Ortega and Filds*had borne some fruit.  Perhaps not quite after the fashionthat the Jesuits believed; but when Maceta and Cataldinoarrived at Guayra and founded the Reduction of Loreto,their success at first was of a nature that almost justifiedthe epithet `miraculous', an epithet which indeed all men applyto any enterprise of theirs which meets success.  Almost fromthe first inception of the missions, the Jesuits found themselvesin the strange position of, though being hated by the Spanish settlers,yet recurred to as mediators when any of the wild tribesproved too powerful for the Spanish arms.  Thus, far from cities,far from even such elementary civilization as Paraguay should show,almost upon the edge of the great cataract of the Parana,the Jesuits founded their first reduction; to which the Indians flockedin such numbers that a second was soon necessary, to which they gavethe name of San Ignacio, in memory of the founder of their rule.--* Some of the Spanish writers refer to Filds as Padre Tom Filds.  His real name was Fields, and he was a Scotchman.--For the first few years all went well with the Jesuits.  The Indians,happy to escape the persecutions of the Spaniards on the one hand,and the incursions of the Paulistas* on the other, flocked to the reductions,mission after mission was soon formed, and the wild Indiansgathered up into townships and taught the arts of peace.But though the Guaranis at first entered into the Jesuit reductionsas a refuge against their persecutors, the Portuguese and Spaniards,soon, as was only natural to men accustomed to a wild forest life,they found the Jesuit discipline too irksome, and often fledback to the woods.  Then the poor priest, left without his flock,had to take up the trail of the flying neophytes, follow themto the recesses of the forests, and persuade them to come back.--* The Paulistas were the inhabitants of the Portuguese (now Brazilian)  town of Sao Paulo.  Azara, who hated the Jesuits (his brother,  Don Nicolas de Azara, having been concerned in their expulsion),  says that fear of the Paulistas contributed to the success of the Jesuits  with the Indians.  Dean Funes (`Historia del Paraguay', etc.)  says just as reasonably that it was fear of the Spanish settlers.--As a means to secure the confidence of the Indians, the Jesuitsfound themselves obliged to communicate as rarely as possiblewith the Spanish settlements.  Thus, from the first the policy of isolation,which was one of the chief charges brought against the Order in later years,was of necessity begun.*  Voltaire, no lover of religious Orders,says of the Jesuits:**  `When in 1768 the missions of Paraguayleft the hands of the Jesuits, they had arrived at perhapsthe highest degree of civilization to which it is possibleto conduct a young people, and certainly at a far superior statethan that which existed in the rest of the new hemisphere.The laws were respected there, morals were pure, a happy brotherhoodunited every heart, all the useful arts were in a flourishing state,and even some of the more agreeable sciences; plenty was universal.'--* There was, however, a royal Order (`cedula real') which applied  to all America, which especially prohibited Spaniards from living  in the Indian towns, and, moreover, provided that even for purposes of trade  no Spaniard should remain for more than three days in an Indian town.** `Histoire Politique et Philosophique des Indes', vol. i., p. 289   (Gene\ve, 1780).--It is, however, to be remembered that Voltaire wrote as a philosopher,and not as an economist, and that his statement most probablywould be traversed by those who see advancement ratherin material improvement than in moral happiness, for without doubt,in Lima and in Mexico upon the whole, society must have madeamongst the Spanish and Spanish-descended citizens greater advancesthan in the Jesuit reductions of Paraguay.  In some respectstheir almost inaccessible situation close to the cataract of the Paranawas favourable to the early Jesuits, and in quick successionthe villages of Loreto, San Francisco Xavier, San Jose, San Ignacio,San Pedro, and others of less importance, were founded, containing in allabout forty thousand souls.*--* Cretineau Joly, `Histoire Religieuse, Politique et Litte/raire  de la Compagnie de Je/sus', vol. iii., cap. v., p. 322 (Paris, 1846).--So in the Jesuit reductions of the province of Guayrawas first begun the system of treating the Indians kindly,and standing between them and the Spanish settlers,which made the Company of Jesus so hated afterwards in Paraguay.Little by little their influence grew, so that when, in 1614,Padre Antonio Ruiz de Montoya arrived, he found that there were alreadyone hundred and nineteen Jesuits in Guayra and in Paraguay.Of all the Jesuits who, during the long period of their labours,appeared in Paraguay, he was the most remarkable; one of the most learned menof the age in which he lived, he yet united in himselfthe qualities of a man of action to those of scholar and of missionary.Without his presence most likely not a tenth part of the Indianswould have escaped after the destruction of the missions of Guayrain 1630 and 1631 at the hands of the half-civilized hordesknown as Paulistas or Mamalucos, who from the city of San Paulocarried fire and sword amongst the Guaranis.It is easy to understand that the Spanish colonists,who had looked on all the Indians as slaves, were rendered furiousby the advent of the Jesuits, who treated them as men.To-day the European colonist in Africa labours less to enslavethan to exterminate the natives; but if a body of clergy of any secthaving the abnegation and disregard of consequences of the Jesuits of oldshould arise, fancy the fury that would be evoked if they insistedthat it were as truly murder to slay a black man as it is to kill a manwhose skin is white.  Most fortunately, our clergy of to-day,especially those of the various churches militant in Uganda, think otherwise,and hold that Christ was the first inventor of the `colour-line'.At the first settlement of South America great semi-feudal fiefscalled `encomiendas' were granted to the conquerors.  One of the conditionsof their tenure was that the `encomenderos' (the owners of the fiefs)`should see to the religious education of the Indians'.Much the same kind of thing as to enjoin kindness and Christian forbearanceupon the directors of a modern Chartered Company.  But, in additionto the `encomiendas', two other systems were in vogue called`yanaconas' and `mitayos', which were in fact designed to reduce the Indiansto the condition of mere slaves.Herrera* says that the `"yanaconas" were men destined from birthto perpetual slavery and captivity, and in their clothing, treatment,and the conditions of their toil, were differently treated from free men.'--* `Historia General de los hechos de los Castellanos  en las Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano', decad. v., lib. iv., cap. xl.--In Paraguay these `yanaconas' were known as `Indios Originarios',and generally were descendants of Indians conquered in war; they, too,were in a condition of serfdom.  They lived in the house of the `encomendero',and could not be sold, and the `encomendero' was (in theory) obligednot only to feed and clothe them, but to instruct them in religious truths.In order to see that these conditions were duly carried out, visitors weresent each year to hear what mutually the `encomenderos' and the Indianshad to say.Herrera*1* describes the Indians under the `mitayo' systemby the name of `mitayos tindarunas', explaining that the word `tindaruna'signifies `forced labour'.  The chiefs had to providea certain number of them every year to work in mines and manufactories,and so well was the labour in the mines known to be fatal,that the Indians upon being drawn for service disposed of all their property,and not infrequently divorced their wives.  The `mitayos' wereat the beginning Indians who had not fought against the Spaniards,but had submitted to their rule.  They were grouped in townshipscomposed of portions of a tribe under a chief to whom the Spaniards gavethe position of Alcalde.  In the towns thus formed only the menbetween eighteen and fifty were liable to be drawn for service in the mines;originally their term of service was for only two months in the year,and for the remaining ten months they were in theory as freeas were the Spanish settlers.  By 1612 the abuses of their systemhad so diminished the number of the Indians that Don Francisco de Alfarowas named by the Spanish Government to report upon it,and to reform abuses where he found it possible.  His report declaredthat the Guaranis and Guaycurus should not be made slaves of,and it abolished in their favour the forced labour which they hadpreviously endured.  The European settlers in Asuncion thoughtthat this was owing to the influence of the Jesuits, and thereforethey expelled them from the town.  Recalled to Santiago,they founded there a college, and those who remained in Paraguaypushed on the mission-work.  Brabo*2* points out thatthe first twenty reductions founded by the Company of Jesus were settledin the first twenty years from their first appearance in the land,*3*and that from the foundation of the Mission of St. George(the last established of the first twenty towns) to that of San Joaquim,in the wild forests of the Taruma, they employed a hundred and twelve years.In the interval they chiefly occupied themselves in the consolidationof their first settlements, and in various unsuccessful attemptsto institute similar reductions amongst the Indians of the Chacoacross the Paraguay.--*1* `Historia General de los hechos de los Castellanos en    las Islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano', decad. v., lib. x., cap. lxxx.*2* `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas'    (Madrid, 1872).*3* The Franciscans had already five or six settlements.--But whilst the Jesuits were settling their reductionsin the province of Guayra and those upon the Parana and Uruguay,a nest of hawks looked at their neophytes as pigeonsready fattening for their use.  Almost eight hundred miles away,at the city of San Paulo de Piritinanga, in Brazil, a strange societyhad come into existence by degrees.  Peopled at firstby Portuguese and Dutch adventurers and malefactors, it had becomea nest of pirates and a home for all the desperadoes of Brazil and Paraguay.This engaging population, being in want of wives wherebyto propagate their virtues, took to themselves Indians and negresses,and bred a race worse ten times than were themselves,as often happens both in the cases of Mulattos and Mestizos in America.Under the name of Mamelucos* (given to them no one knows why)they soon became the terror of the land.  Equally at home on horseback,in canoes upon the rivers, or in schooners on the sea,excellent marksmen and courageous fighters, they subsisted chieflyby procuring Indians as slaves for the plantations in Brazil.In a short time they exhausted all the Indians near San Paulo,and were forced to search far in the depths of the unknown interior.Little by little, following the course of the great rivers in their canoes,they reached the Jesuit settlements upon the upper waters of the Parana,where they burned the towns and the churches, made captives of the converts,and killed the priests.  Montoya relates that a Jesuit,having clasped an Indian in his arms to save him, was deluged with his blood,a Mameluco having crept up behind him and plunged his lance into the Indianbehind the Jesuit's back.  The Mameluco, on being, as Montoya says,`reprehended' by the Jesuit, dogmatically remarked, `I shall be savedin spite of God, for to be saved a man has only to believe,'**a remark which showed him clearly an honest opponent of the Jesuits,as they insisted greatly on the doctrine of good works.--* The word in Brazil is used to designate a half-breed, but the etymology  seems unknown.** `Me he de salvar a pesar de Dios, porque para salvarse el hombre   no ha menester mas que creer' (Ruiz Montoya, `Conquista Espiritual').   Montoya adds with a touch of humour quite in Cervantes' vein:   `Este, sabe ya por experiencia la falsedad de su doctrina,   porque le mataron de tres balazos, sin confesion.'--Ruiz Montoya and others tell us that the plan of action of the Paulistaswas either to attack the Jesuit reductions on Sunday, when the sheepwere gathered in the fold listening to Mass, surround the church,murder the priest, and carry off the neophytes as slaves; or else,disguised as Jesuits, enter a mission, gain the confidence of the Indians,and then communicate with their soldiers, who were waiting in the woods.But not content with this, it seems, so often did they practise singing Massto pass as Jesuits, that on returning to San Paulo, in their orgies,their great diversion was to masquerade as priests.  So that the rascalsnot only profited by their villainy, but extracted much amusementfrom their wicked deeds.*  This, in Montoya's opinion, was even more damnablethan the actual crime.  And so no doubt it was, and we in England,by having made our vice as dull as virtue is in other lands,have gone some way towards morality, for vice and virtue,both deprived of humour, become not so far separatedas some virtuous dull folk may think.--* The Mamelucos sometimes pushed their forays right through Paraguay  into the district of the Moxos, and Padre Patricio Fernandez,  in his curious `Relacion de los Indios Chiquitos' (Madrid, 1726),  relates their adventures in that far-distant district,  and the conflicts which the Indians, led by their priests and helped  by the Spanish settlers, sustained.--Quite naturally, these redoubtable land and river piratessaw in the Jesuit reductions upon the Paranapane, and generallythroughout the district of Guayra, merely an opportunity of capturingmore Indians than usual at a haul.  In 1629 they first appearedbefore the Mission of San Antonio and destroyed it utterly,burning the church and houses, and driving off the Indians to sell as slaves.San Miguel and Jesus-Maria shortly suffered the same fate.  In ConcepcionPadre Salazar was regularly besieged, and he and all the people reducedto eating dogs, cats, rats, mice, and even snakes.  At the last moment,when about to surrender, Father Cataldino, hastily arming some Indians withany rude weapons at his command, marched on the place and raised the siege.A worthy member of the Church militant this exploring, fighting,intrepid Italian priest, and one the Company of Jesus should honour,for to him, perhaps as much as to any of these first explorersof the Upper Parana, is credit due.But still the Mamelucos ran their course, destroying town after town,so that in the short space of a year (1630-31) they destroyed partiallythe reductions of San Francisco Xavier, San Jose, San Pedro,and La Concepcion; and the two first founded, San Ignacio and Loreto,were ruined utterly.  The wretched Indians, to whom by lawthe Jesuits were forbidden to serve out firearms, stood no chanceagainst the well-trained Paulistas, with their horses, guns, and bloodhounds,assisted as they were by troops of savage Indians who dischargedpoisoned arrows from blowpipes and from bows.  Small wonder that,as Montoya, Charlevoix, Lahier,*1* and Filiberto Monero*2* all agree,despair took hold of them, so that in many instancesthey cursed the Jesuits and fled back to the woods.  When one reflectsthat many of the Indian tribes looked upon baptism as a poison,*3*it is not strange that they should have associated effect with cause,and set down all their sufferings to the influence of the malignant riteto which the Jesuits had subjected them.  The isolated Jesuitsran considerable risk from their own sheep, and Padre Mola,after the ruin of San Antonio, was suspected by them of being in leaguewith the Paulistas, and had to flee for safety to another town;and as a touch of comedy is seldom wanting to make things bittererto those in misfortune, a troop of savage Indians, having arrivedto attack the Reduction of San Antonio, and finding it already burning,instantly thought poor Padre Mola had been the instigator,and, starting on his trail, almost surprised him before he reached a refugefrom their patriotic rage.--*1* Lahier (Francisci) S. I., `Annae Paraguarie, Annor. 1635, et duor. sequ.'*2* `Relazioni della Provincia del Paraguai'.*3* Brabo.--Thus in the greater world reformers of all sorts have not infrequentlyin times of scarcity and danger been taken by their protegesfor the authors of their trials and stoned, whilst the smug Governmentwhich caused the ruin, well bolstered up in the affection of its `taxables',chuckled, serenely confident in the unending folly of mankind.Most certainly the Jesuits struggled to do their duty to their neophytesin what they thought they saw was right.  On foot and unattendedFathers Maceta and Mansilla followed the fifteen thousand captives to Brazil,confessing those who fell upon the road before they died,and instant in supplication to the Paulistas for the prisoners' release.Father Maceta especially behaved heroically, carrying the chains of thosewho could hardly drag themselves along, himself half deadwith hunger and his constant toil.  Especially he strove to effectthe release of a captive chief called Guiravera, who had beenone of his bitterest enemies, and strove so hard that a Paulista captain,either touched by his zeal or wearied with his pleading,released the chief, his wife and family, and six of the Indians of his tribe.The chief returned to become the Jesuits' best friend,and the two priests on foot followed the captives' train.What they endured on foot without provisions, tortured by insects,and in danger from wild beasts, as well as constant perils from the Paulistas,who now and then pricked them with lances or fired pistols over their headsto frighten them away, none but those who have journeyedin the forests of that forgotten corner of the world can estimate.I see them in their torn and sun-browned cassocks struggling throughthe `esteros'*1* in water to the knees, falling and rising oft,after the fashion of the supposititious Christian on life's way;pushing along through forest paths across which darted humming-birds,now coming on a dying man and kneeling by his side, now gatheringthe berries of the guavirami*2* to eat upon the road, and then againcatching sight of a jaguar as it slunk beside the trail, and all the timeconvinced that all their efforts, like the efforts of most of thosewho strive, would be in vain.  So stumbling through the woods,crossing the rivers on inflated ox-skins, baked by the sunupon the open plains, at length the Jesuits reached San Paulo,where they had a college, and without resting set at once to work.In season (and what in cases of the kind is ten times more important),out of season, they besought, pleaded, and preached, and findingas little grace from the Paulista chiefs as a transgressor againstsome fiery dogma would find from a sour-faced North British dogmatist,they started for Rio de Janeiro to see the Council-General of Brazil.There they were told that the right person to addresswas the Captain-General of the colony, who had his residence in Bahia,five or six hundred miles away.  Not the least daunted, they set out,and found Don Diego Luis Oliveira more or less friendly, but as usualfearful of giving offence to those who had a vested interest in the trade.Then the two Jesuits, hearing that another invasion of the Paulistaswas expected in Guayra, started back on their long journeythrough the woods, over the plains, across the mountain ranges,and through the dank `esteros' which lay between them and their missionson the Parana.  The Captain-General seems to have been rousedto a sense of the position by their words, for on his annual visitationat San Paulo he spoke in public to the colonists against their slave raids,when a shot fired from the meeting ended his speech.*3*  The inhabitantsthen signified to him that, sooner than give up what seemed to thema justifiable and honest means of life, they would be debaptized.How they proposed to debaptize themselves is not related,but perhaps after the fashion of the Guaranis -- by sand, hot water,and scraping with a shell; though why the tongue should be thus scarifiedseems doubtful, for no sect of Christians that is knownexacts that people at that sacrament should put out their tongues,and even baptism does little or nothing to increase the power of scandalinherent both in those who have been and those who never were baptized.--*1* An `estero' is a tract of country covered by water    to the depth of two or three feet.  The bottom is usually hard,    but it is full of holes and hummocks.  High pampa grass and reeds    not infrequently obscure the view, and clouds of insects    make life miserable.  If the tract extends to more than a day's journey,    the night passed on a dry hummock, holding one's horse and listening    without a fire to the wild beasts, is likely to remain    present to one in after-life, especially if alone; the only things    that seem to link one to humanity are one's horse and the familiar stars.    Perhaps that is why Capella has always seemed to me in some sort    my own property.*2* This curious berry, about the size of a large damson,    grows on a little shrub in sandy and rocky soils.    It has a thick yellow rind and several large seeds,    and the property of being icy cold in the hottest weather --    a true traveller's joy.  Dr. de Bourgade de la Dardye,    in his excellent book on Paraguay (the English edition    published in London in 1892), thinks it is either a eugenia or a myrtus.*3* Charlevoix, vol. i., liv. vii., p. 384.--About this time (1630) the poor Jesuits were much tormentedby the return to paganism of their Indians, and most especiallyby a hideous dwarf who set himself up as a god, and founda host of worshippers.  Good Father Charlevoix thinksthat `ce petit-monstre',* despairing of being thought a man, had no resourcebut to give out he was a god, and remarks that, as even more hideous godshave been adored, it is not surprising that the Indians took him at his word.When stripped of the somewhat strange phraseology of the simple Jesuit,there is nothing really shocking in the incident.  People in general,in making gods, endue them with their own least admirable attributes,and logically these poor Indians but followed out the general scheme.--* Ibid., liv. vii., p. 359.--But in the midst of heresies and dwarf-gods, with the Paulistasalmost always in the field, a man arose who was to leadthe Jesuits and their neophytes out of Guayra and settle themsecurely below the cataract in the Misiones of Paraguay.Born probably late in the sixteenth century in Spain,Antonio Ruiz de Montoya was amongst the first of the Jesuit Fatherswho came to Paraguay.  In 1612 we find him recently arrived from Spain;*1*sent up to the province of Guayra to the assistance of FathersMaceta and Cataldino.  For thirty years,*2* as he himself informs usin his book, he remained in Paraguay, and in his own pathetic wordshe tells us how most of his life was spent.  `I have lived,' he says,`all through the period of thirty years in Paraguay, as in the desertsearching for wild beasts -- that is, for savage Indians --crossing wild countries, traversing mountain chains, in orderto find Indians and bring them to the true sheepfold of the Holy Churchand to the service of His Majesty.*3*  With my companions I establishedthirteen reductions or townships in the wilds, and this I didwith great anxiety, in hunger, nakedness, and frequent peril of my life.And all these years I passed far from my brother Spaniards have made mealmost a rustic and ignorant of the polished language of the Court.'Travelling as he did continually, few knew the countryfrom Guayra to Yapeyu*4* so well as he; he tells us thatfor `all travelling equipment' he took a hammock, and a little mandioca flour,that he usually travelled on foot with either sandals or bare feet,and that for eight or nine years he never once tasted bread.--*1* Charlevoix, `Histoire du Paraguay', vol. lvi., p. 285.*2* `Conquista Espiritual del Paraguay', Ruiz de Montoya,    introductory chapter.*3* This may either mean to the service of God or to the service of the King    (Philip III.), for in the time of Montoya `Majesty' was used in addressing    both the King of Spain and the King of Heaven.*4* Yapeyu, or Reyes, was the southernmost of the Jesuit reductions.    It was situated upon the Uruguay in what is now    the Argentine province of Entre Rios.--About the year 1611-12 we find him charged with a missionto the Provincial at Asuncion to disabuse him of a reportwhich had been carried there that the Jesuits of Guayrawere garnering in no fruit from all their labours in the wilds.The rumour had been so much repeated that the superiors in Asuncionwere on the point of calling back the missionaries and giving up all hope.Montoya, accompanied by six Indians, set out upon the journey,which by land to-day is enough to appal the boldest traveller.Walking along, he found himself about the middle of his way alone,his Indians having loitered in the rear.  Night caught him in the forests,and a storm came on.  He passed the night at the foot of a large tree,hungry and wet, and, waking in the morning, found himselfso crippled with arthritic pains as to be obliged to continue his journeyon his hands and knees.  Alone and helpless, he dragged himself to a placecalled Maracayu, and, failing to obtain a canoe, went on another league,and there lay down to die, his leg being swelled enormouslywith the rheumatic pains.  Then, as he says himself, he prayed to San Ignacio,telling him that from a sentiment of obedience he had set out uponthe journey through the waste.  Nothing could have been better,for the saint (who must have seen him all the time), flattered, perhaps,that his own chief virtue had been the cause of so much pain,promptly healed him and restored his leg to its usual size,and Montoya went on his way rejoicing to Asuncion.  The Provincialheard and was disabused, but was unable to send a single man to help,and poor Montoya set off again back to Guayra alone, having gained nothingbut his sufferings on the road.Again, in 1614, we find him in Asuncion combating calumniesspread by the Spanish settlers against the Jesuits.In the same year (as he informs us*) he was witnessin the Reduction of Loreto of a strange circumstance.`An Indian,' he says, `of intelligence and pious conduct called meto administer the last Sacraments, and to confess him before he died,and this I did.  As there seemed little hope of his recovery,and pressing business called me away, I quitted him after having given ordersfor his burial.  He died in a short time -- at least, all thosewho were with him had no doubt of this; on my return I found the manwhom I had charged to stay beside the Indian till his deathpreparing for his funeral.  Toward mid-day they came to tell methat the dead man had come to life, and wished to speak to me.  I ran there,and found him with a cheerful face in the middle of a crowd of Indians.I asked him what had happened since I last saw him, and he answered methat the instant that I quitted him his soul had taken its departurefrom his body; then, at a point which he thought near to his hammock,a devil had appeared, who said to him, "You are my prey,"and that he answered it could not be, for he had confessed himselfto the best of his ability, and had received the holy Viaticumbefore his death; that the devil had sustained that his confessionhad been incomplete, and that he had forgotten to confessthat twice he had been drunk, to which he answered that it was an oversight,and he hoped that God would not remember it.  Then, on the devil sustainingthat he had committed a sacrilege, St. Peter had appeared, followed by angels,and driven off the fiend.  I asked him how he had known St. Peter,and he replied by describing him, though he had never seenan image of the saint.  "The saint," he said, "covered me with his mantle,and I felt myself instantly carried through the air.  First I perceiveda lovely landscape, and further on a great city, from whicha shining light appeared.  Then the Apostle and the angels stopped,and the first said to me, `This is the city of the Lord;we live here with Him, but the time of your entry is not yet.It is written that your soul shall once more join your body,and in three days you must appear in church.'  Then all was dark,and in an instant I woke up alive and well."--* `Conquista Espiritual', p. 22.--`I,' says Montoya, `understood by the last words of St. Peterthat the man had to die in three days, and I asked what he thought himself."I think," said he, "that next Sunday they will carry my body to the church,and I am certain that I only returned to life in order to exhortmy relatives and my friends to listen to your instructions." . . .When Sunday came he made his general confession,* admitted the two sinsthe devil had reproached him with, exhorted all to live a Christian life,and a few moments afterwards quietly gave up the ghost.'--* This time, it is to be hoped, without omissions.--This is the sole occasion on which Padre Ruiz Montoya even remotelytouches the field of miracles, as he in general reliesupon himself, his knowledge of the world, and on his patience,which must have been almost North British in its quality,if he acted up to his own favourite maxim of `by returning thanks for injuriesis how wise men conduct their business.'*--* `Dando gracias por agravios negocian los hombres sabios.'--In 1623 we find him praying Father Cataldino to let him accompanythe expedition to Itiranbaru, a mountain wooded to the summit,in which lived several wild tribes.  There he so worked upon the Indiansas to establish them in a reduction under the title of St. Francis Xavier,*and left the mountain, which had been a haunt of savages,as Padre del Techo says in his curious work on Paraguay,`all at the service of the Lord.'--* Soon afterwards ruined by the Paulistas.--In 1623, whilst preaching, he was suddenly assailed by hostile Indians,and seven of his Indians pierced with arrows at his feet.Undoubtedly, he must have been killed had not an Indiantaken his hat and cloak, and run into the middle of the enemyto distract the fire.  In the confusion both the heroic Indian and Montoyamanaged to escape, the latter getting into a canoe which, fortunately,was ready at the river-side.  But in the midst of all his occupationshe had time to study natural history in the spirit of the time,as the following description clearly shows:  `Amongst the otherrarities of the land is an amphibious animal. . . .  It is like a sheep,with but the difference that its teeth and nails are like a tiger's,which animal it equals in ferocity.  The Indians never look on itwithout terror, and when it sallies from the marshes where it lives(which it does ordinarily in troops), they have no other chance of escapebut to climb up a tree, and even then sometimes are not in safety,for this terrible creature sometimes uproots the tree, or sometimesstays on guard until the Indian falls into its jaws.'  Thus far Montoya;but Charlevoix informs us that, `en langue Guaranie', it is known as the `ao',and rather tamely adds, `When one of these animals is slain,the people make a jacket of its skin.'Again, Montoya tells us of the horse on which the venerable Padre Roqueused to ride, which, when he died, refused all food, and wept perpetually,two streams of water running from its eyes.  It never allowed an Indianto mount it after its master's death, and finally expired,close to his grave, of grief.  A kindly, scholarly, intrepid priest,well skilled in knowledge of the world, and not withoutsome tincture of studies in science, as the above-related anecdotesreveal to us.  No doubt the Indians loved him far and wide,and his superiors stood in some little awe of him, as those in officeoften do of their subordinates when they show that capacity for actionwhich is a sure bar to advancement either in Church or State.In 1627 Montoya was made head of the missions in Guayra,which opened up to him the opportunity of showing what kind of man he was.In this year the Spaniards of Villa Rica, the nearest town in Paraguayto the reductions in Guayra, sent out an expedition to chastize some Indianswho had insulted a chief called Tayaoba, whom Montoya had baptized.This was the pretext for the expedition, but Montoya knew wellthat the real object was to hunt for slaves.  He brought before the Governorthe edict of the King of Spain forbidding any war to be made upon the Indianswithout sufficient cause.  All was in vain, and the expeditionleft Villa Rica and plunged into the wilds.  Montoya, sore againstthe Governor's desire, went with the expedition, taking with himPadre Salazar and some well-armed Indians.  It was lucky for the Spaniardsthat he was there, for on the second day a flight of arrowsburst from a wood and wounded many of them.  The captain of the expeditionordered a retreat, which, situated as they were, exposed on all sidesto the fire of an enemy whom they could not see, must have proved fatal.Montoya counselled throwing up earthworks before some hutswhich stood upon the edge of the woods in which the Indians were;this done, he sent a messenger to Villa Rica for reinforcements.Even behind the earthworks the Spaniards were hard pressed;no one could show himself without being pierced by an arrow.The number of the Indians daily increased, till on the third daythey numbered about four thousand, and seemed likely to advance upon the huts.The Spanish captain ordered a rally, and the neophytes wished to decamp,taking Montoya with them, and then gain the shelter of the woods.This he would not allow, and, charging with the soldiers,put the Indians to flight.  The Spaniards, far from being gratefulfor their lives, seeing their hopes of making prisoners had vanished,wished to lay hands upon the Indians whom Montoya had brought,and who had fought beside them in the recent fray.  Hearing thatin the morning the Spanish soldiers would attack his neophytes,Montoya sent them off by night, and in the morning, when the Spanish captainfound him and the other priest alone, he said, `Thinking you had no other usefor the Indians, I advised them to return.'  The captain had the graceto say nothing but, `Then, you gave them good advice, my father.'The two priests waited patiently till the soldiers had retired,and then sent for their Indians and quietly went home.  Thus it appearsthat at necessity Padre Montoya was a true son of San Ignacio.In 1628 Montoya seems to have met for the first time Padre Diaz Tano,who afterwards was his companion both in the retreat from Guayradown the Parana and in his mission to the King.  No matterwhether a man make his career with Indians in the wilds of Paraguayor amongst the so-called reasoning people in more sophisticated lands,if he once show himself superior to the ordinary run of men,there is something of an invidious character certain to be attributed to himby those who think that genius is the worst attribute that man can have.This, Montoya did not escape from amongst the Spaniards, but the Indians,at least, were less envious, being perhaps less educated, for they believedthat the soul of one of their `caciques',* known in his life as Quaratici,had entered into him.  The rumour reached at last a chief called Guiravera,known to the Spaniards as the `Exterminator' from his cruelty,who, hearing that the soul of his late rival had entered into Montoya,came to see him at the head of a large retinue of people of his tribe.Montoya and Maceta were at Villa Rica, and on the chief's approachthey happened to be seated in the plaza of the town.  As he approached them,followed by his men, and with a threatening air, they remained seated,merely motioning him to take a seat upon a bench.  This he did, after makingone of his men cover the seat with a tiger-skin and stand behind on guard.What passed between them, most unluckily, Montoya has not set down.What he has told us only makes us wish for more, for it appearsthat after the usual salutations Guiravera refused to speak,and getting up walked about the town, silently looking at everything.But, as it ever happens, even Montoya was no exceptionto the general run of history-writers, who usually are occupied alonewith facts which seem to them important at the time,forgetting that posterity (for whom they write) can judge of the resultas well as they themselves, but thirst for details to complete the chainbetwixt them and their predecessors.  One thing is set down `in extenso'-- not by Montoya, but by another Jesuit -- that is,the sermon which Montoya preached to bring the chief into the fold.Considered as a sermon it does not seem out of the common way,and judged by its results was futile at the time, for the chiefanswered coldly that he would think the matter over, and then retiredinto the woods.  But the seed thus sown in Villa Rica was to bear fruit,for in a year the chief, either tired of his ancestral gods or having ponderedon the sermon, came into the fold and was baptized as Paul.--* `Cacique' = chief.--An irruption*1* of the Mamelucos called Father Montoya frombaptizing Indians and recovering their souls to the more prosaic,if as useful, task of saving their bodies, which he didat the immediate peril of his own.  The Mamelucos had appeared (1628)before the Reduction of Encarnacion, and many of the Indians had alreadytaken refuge in the woods.  Those who remained were like a flock of sheepwithout a shepherd, and knew not what to do.  Padre Montoya hastenedto the spot, and called on every Christian to take up arms.Under the circumstances he undoubtedly was right; still, in reading historyone is puzzled to observe how often and in how many different countriesChristians have to resort to arms.  But before proceeding to extremities,Montoya sent out Fathers Mendoza and Domenecchi with some ofthe principal inhabitants of the reduction to parley with the Mamelucos,who, under their celebrated leader Antonio Raposo, were encampedoutside the place.  Upon arriving within range of the Paulista campthey were greeted with a shower of balls and arrows, which killedseveral of the Indians and wounded Father Mendoza in the foot.  But when,in spite of his wound, the Jesuit advanced towards the camp and insistedon speaking with the leader, the Mamelucos were so struck with his couragethat they gave up to him several of the Indians whom they had taken prisonersupon the previous day.  Next day Father Montoya, encouraged bythe unhoped-for success of Father Mendoza, went out himself,and, facing the Paulistas, somewhat imprudently threatened themwith the wrath of Heaven and the King if they did not retire.The wrath of Heaven is often somewhat capricious in its action,and the King of Spain, although as wrathful as he had been an Emperor,was too far away to inspire much terror in his subjects on the Parana.So that the Paulista treated the wrath of both their Majestiesas qualities which he could well neglect, and for sole answerordered his men to march upon the town.  But, whether owingto their hard hearts having been touched by the good Father's eloquence,or the fact that the neophytes were under arms, when the Paulistasarrived close to the town they altered their intentions and filed offinto the woods.  Profiting by the respite from hostilities,Montoya, in conjunction with Padre Diaz Tano and a Father bearingthe somewhat curious name of Padre Justo Vansurk Mansilla,*2*devoted all his attention for the time to the Mission of Santa Maria la Mayor,which was the most flourishing of all the missions of the time,and which to-day still shows the greatest remnants of the Jesuits' work,both in regard to architecture and the remains of Indian populationstill settled on the old mission lands.  But even therethe Jesuits did not escape without their trials, for it appears*3*that a quantity of new proselytes arrived with women, whom the good Fathersstigmatized as `concubines', and whom the ignorant Indiansin the innocence of their hearts looked on as wives.  The order being givento dismiss these concubines (or wives), a few submitted; but the rest,leaving the mission, started cultivating a tract of land in the vicinity.--*1* These raids were known as `malocas'.*2* In Paraguay it was not unusual for foreign Jesuits    to hispaniolize their names; thus, Smith became Esmid.    But it was more usual to add a Spanish name, as appears    to have been the case with P. Vansurk Mansilla.  Father Manuel Querini,    in his report to the King of Spain in 1750, mentions the names of Boxer,    Keiner, and Limp, with many other French, English, and German names,    amongst those of priests at the various missions.*3* Montoya, `Conquista Espiritual'.  Also Charlevoix.--Then the good Fathers, with Montoya at their head, hit on a stroke of genius.Taking the opportunity when the seceding Indians were awaygathering their crops, they set fire to their houses and carried offthe children and the women,* back to the mission.  The recalcitrantsappeared next day at Santa Maria la Mayor, and were received againinto the bosom of the Church.  Heresy, also, now and then made its appearance,for two rascals, having built two temples upon two hills,transported to them the skeletons of two magicians long since dead,and the fickle people left the churches empty, and went to worshipat the magicians' shrines.  But in this season of sorrow and of care,and whilst the churches in the Mission of Encarnacion were left deserted,Montoya once again showed his determination, and put things right.Not being able to cope alone with the heathen, Father Diaz Tanowent to Guayra, and induced Montoya (still the superior of the reductionsin that province) to give his aid.  He came, and, having armedsome of the faithful, at dead of night attacked the temples and razed themto the ground.--* It is certain that the Guaranis, like many other Indians,  were polygamists, and Xarque, in his `Vida Apostolica  del P. Joseph Cataldino', thus explains the matter:  `El tener tanto numero de concubinas, no solamente lo ocasiona  su natural lascivo, sino tambien, el vicio de la embriaguez,  pues teniendo tantas criadas tenian con mas abundancia su cerveza y vino.'  Thus Xarque seems to agree with the late Miss Mary Kingsley,  who in one of her books (though she says nothing about  the `natural lascivo' of the negroes of the West Coast of Africa)  seems to attribute the polygamy of the negroes to the difficulty  a man experiences, in the countries in which she travelled,  in getting his food prepared by one wife.--In 1631 Montoya and others came in the forests of Guayraupon the wild Caaguas.  These they strove hard to civilize,but, after labouring long, with all their eloquence were ableto induce only eighteen to return with them to the Encarnacion.It was `with difficulty that they were able to give thema sufficient knowledge of the mysteries of our faith to be ableto bestow the rite of baptism.'  It may be that the Caaguas,not having much to occupy their minds, approached the mysteries of our faithin more receptive attitudes than is attained by those whose minds are full.But, anyhow, Montoya, with true prudence, deferred their baptismtill just before their death, for a few months of life outside the forestsproved fatal to them all.  Faith is a wondrous thing,and able to move most things, even common-sense.  One wonders, though,why, when the Jesuits learned from experience that the poor Indiansinvariably died when exposed to the burning sun upon the plains,they continued in their fatal efforts to inflict baptismon the unoffending people of the woods.  If it were necessary,it surely might have taken place in their own homes, and the patients thenmight have been left to chance, to see how the reception of the holy riteacted upon their lives.In 1631 the Mamelucos broke into the province of Guayra.All was confusion, and Montoya sent Father Diaz Tano to Asuncionto beg the Governor, Don Luis de Cespedes, to send them help.He answered that he could do nothing, and thus by leavingthe whole territory of Guayra without defence lost a rich provinceto the Crown of Spain.  Though at the time (1631) Portugal and Spainwere united, yet in the Indies their subjects were at war,and though in Europe Spain was the stronger of the two,in America the Portuguese conquered about that time rich provinces,which to-day form part of the quondam Empire of Brazil.Upon the failure of Don Luis de Cespedes to render help,Padre Diaz Tano was despatched to Charcas*1* to lay the matterbefore the Audiencia Real (the High Court of the Indies).The frequent journeys and diplomatic negotiations in whichthe Jesuits of Paraguay were engaged rendered them far more aptto manage business than members of the other Orders in America.Whilst in Guayra all was confusion, and the Paulistas swept through the landruining everything, upon the Uruguay things prospered, and Padre Romerofounded two new reductions (1631), known as San Carlos and Apostoles;he also laid the foundation of that territory in whichthe persecuted neophytes of Guayra were soon to find a safe retreat.Father Diaz Tano by this time had returned from Charcaswith a decree of the High Court, declaring the action of Don Luis de Cespedesin failing to protect Guayra against the Mamelucos prejudicial tothe interests of the King; but as neither he nor the High Court of Charcaspossessed any power by means of which to stimulate the Governorto greater zeal, the decree was useless, and Tano and Ruiz Montoyafound themselves summoned hastily to meet a new attack.  But beforethey arrived the missions, both of San Francisco Xavier and of San Jose,had been destroyed.  As there were still three reductions undestroyed,Montoya, as Provincial of Guayra, called all the Jesuits of the provinceto deliberate as to their chance of making a defence.  The debate ran high;some of the priests wished that the neophytes should fight to the end;others, more sensible, pointed out that the ill-armed and quite untrainedmilitia of the missions could do nothing with their bows and arrowsagainst the well-led and well-disciplined Paulistas all armed with guns.*2*Padre Truxillo gave it as his opinion that it would be more prudentto transport the Indians to a place of safety, and pointed outthat near the cataract of Guayra they would be ableto cross the river and place it between themselves and the Paulistasin case of an attack.  This advice seemed prudent to the rest,and Father Truxillo set out to make his preparation for the march.Few European travellers even to-day have visited the great cataractknown as El Salto de Guayra, or in Portuguese As sete Quedas.Bourgade la Dardye*3* has described it in his book on Paraguay.Situated as it is in the midst of almost impenetrable forests,it has not even now been properly placed upon the map.  Bourgade la Dardyeinclines to think he was the first to visit it since the expedition sentby the elder Lopez, President of Paraguay, under Lieutenant Patino in 1861.Before that time it had been left unvisited since 1788,when the Boundary Commissioners sent to determine the dividing linebetween the Spanish and Portuguese possessions camped near it for a week.Felix de Azara writes about it in his `Historia del Paraguay',*4*but he does little more than reproduce the account givenby the Boundary Commissioners.  He places it in 24d 4' 27" lat.,and refers to it as `a tremendous precipice of water*5*worthy of Homer or of Virgil's pen.'  He says the waters do not fallvertically as from a balcony or window (`como por un balcon o/ ventana'),but by an inclined plane at an inclination of about fifty degrees.The river close to the top of the falls is about four thousand nine hundredCastilian yards in breadth, and suddenly narrows to about seventy yards,and rushes over the fall with such terrific violence as if it wishedto `displace the centre of the earth, and cause thus the nutationwhich astronomers have observed in the earth's axis.'  The dew or vapourwhich rises from the fall is seen in the shape of a columnfrom many miles away, and on it hangs a perpetual rainbow,which trembles as the earth seems to tremble under one's feet.`The noise,' he says, `is heard full six leagues off, and in the neighbourhoodneither bird nor beast is found.'  In Azara's time the journeywas not too pleasant, for he says:  `He who wishes to see this fallmust cross the desert for thirty leagues from the town of Curuguatyto the river Guatimi.  There he must choose trees to construct canoes.In these he must embark all those who go with him, arms and provisions,and besides, where he embarks, leave an armed escortto secure his base of supplies from the wild Indians' attack.In the canoes he then must navigate the Guatimi for thirty leaguesuntil it joins the Parana, and always with much care,for in the woods upon its banks are Indians who give no quarter.*6* . . .Then there remain three leagues to sail upon the Parana,then one can reach the falls either in the canoes or struggling alongthe woods which fringe the river's bank.'--*1* Charcas is situated in what is now Bolivia, and was extremely inconvenient    for all dwellers on the eastern side of the Andes to reach.    Whether this was a masterpiece of policy calculated    to discourage lawsuits, or whether it was merely due    to Spanish incuriousness and maladministration, is a moot point.*2* The Indians of the missions were not allowed to possess firearms    at this period.*3* `Paraguay', Dr. E. de Bourgade la Dardye; English edition    by George Philips junior (London, 1892).  The Indians    call it Salto de Canandiyu, which, according to Azara,    was the name of a `cacique' whom the first Spaniards met there.*4* `Descripcion y Historia del Paraguay', Madrid, 1847.*5* `Y es un espantoso despen~adero de agua', etc.    (`Descripcion del Paraguay', tomo i., p. 39).*6* `No dan cuartel'.--Azara was, perhaps, of all the travellers of the last century,the man who above all things shines in accuracy, and in point of facthis description of the cataract is the best we have up to the present time.Bourgade la Dardye tells us that not far above the cataractthe Parana expands into a lake almost five miles in breadth,and from the lake the river issues in two great arms, which haveforced their way through the mountains known as the Sierra de Mbaracyu.Dr. Bourgade la Dardye seems to think the circular eddies found in the whirlsare the most curious features of the falls.  He describes them thus:`They flow in falls varying from fifty to sixty feet in depth;these circular eddies, which are quite independent of one another,range along an arc of about two miles in its stretch.They are detached like giant caldrons yawning unexpectedly at one's feet,in which the flood seethes with incredible fury; every one of thesehas opened for itself a narrow orifice in the rock, through whichlike a stone from a sling the water is hurled into the central whirlpool.The width of these outlets rarely exceeds fifteen yards,but their depth cannot be estimated.  They all empty themselvesinto one immense central chamber about two hundred feet wide,rushing into it with astounding velocity. . . .  A more imposing spectaclecan scarcely be conceived, and I doubt whether abysses such as theseexist elsewhere in the world.'  He places the falls in latitude 24d 2' 59",but corrects the longitude given by Azara as 56d 55' west of Paristo 58d 18' 8" -- that is, 53d 57' 53" west from Greenwich, which certainlyhas some importance in fixing the breadth of the territory of Paraguay.But neither Azara nor the French traveller, with their yards and feet,their longitude and latitude, and the rest, give an ideaof the grandeur of the place.  Buried in the primeval forests,forgotten by the world, known to the wandering Indians who give no quarter(any more to-day than in Azara's time), the giant cataractis a lost wonder of the world.  In the ruined missions on the Parana,two hundred miles away, I have heard the Indians talk of it with awe.They told how through the woods tangled with undergrowth,matted together with lianas, they had hewed a path.  Monkeys and parrotschattered at them, and a white miasmatic vapour hung over trees and lakes,burying the clearings in its wreaths, and lifting only at mid-day,to close again upon the woods at night.  They talked of alligators, jaguars,the giant ant-eater, and the mysterious bird known to them as the `ipetata',which in its tail carries a burning fire.  In the recesses of the thicketsdemons lurked, and wild Caaguas, who with a blowpipe and a poisoned arrowslew you and your horse, themselves unseen.  Pools coveredwith Victoria regia; masses of red and yellow flowers upon the trees,the trees themselves gigantic, and the moss which floated from their brancheslong as a spear; the voyage in canoes, whirled like a cork upon the rapids;lastly the falls themselves, and how they, awestricken at the sight,fell prostrate and promised many candles to the Virgin and the saintson their return, they talked of into the watches of the night.Somehow, I like those countries which, as the province of Guayraand Paraguay, appear to have no future, and of which the charm is in the past.It pleases me to think that the sharp business men of times gone by,patting their stomachs (the prison of their brain),predicted great advancement, and were all deceived.  For then it seemsas if the prognostications of to-day's schemes may also fail,and countries which they have doomed to progress still remain as is Guayra,their towns deserted, with but the broken spire of some old churchemerging from the verdure of the tropics, as the St. Paul's Rocksrise sheer out of the sea.  If there is charm in the unknown,there is at least as great a charm in the forgotten,and the Salto de Guayra is one of the most forgotten corners of the earth.To this wild place Father Mendoza proposed to lead the Indiansfrom the Reductions of San Jose and San Francisco Xavier,and then unite with them any of the fugitives he could assemblefrom those reductions which had been destroyed.  But eventhe doglike patience of the Indians was at an end, and they preferredto die or be led captives rather than run the chances of escapein such a solitary place.  In their despair, and placed betweenthe Paulistas and the fear of emigration, the neophytes turned,as even more civilized people than themselves will turn,on their best friends, and held the Jesuits responsible for all their woes.Two Indian women, wives of `caciques', having been taken by the Paulistas,the Indians broke into the church where a Jesuit (Padre Salazar)was officiating, and interrupted him during the Masswith the most bitter insults.  One of the Indians menaced him with a lance,another with an arrow, whilst a third tried to snatch the chalicefrom his hands.  He escaped, and ran, holding the chalice,out into the woods, followed by two little Indian boys.  Wandering about,he fell in with the other Jesuits, all like himself outcasts,without a church, and almost deserted by the Indians.Padre Ruiz Montoya alone possessed a shadow of authority,and he advised the outcasts with the remnant of their flocksto retire into the woods, and sow a crop of maize for food,whilst he endeavoured to get help from Paraguay.  Hardly was this done,when news was brought him which made him alter all his plans.Two messengers came to inform him that an army of Paulistaswas marching on Villa Rica, and that a strong detachment of themwas advancing from the south.  Then Padre Montoya took a supreme resolve,and ordered the evacuation of the two principal reductions(San Ignacio and Loreto) which yet remained intact.  They were the firstwhich had been founded in Guayra, and were as important asany of the Spanish towns in Paraguay.  The churches, all the Jesuit writers,as Montoya, Charlevoix, Mastrilli, and Lozano, are agreed,were finer than any in the land.  The Indians were, according to Montoya,far better Christians than the inhabitants of the Spanish settlements,and their faith and innocence were above all praise.They cultivated cotton and had large herds of cattle,so that the most bitter enemies of the Jesuits must allowthat much had been accomplished in the short space of two-and-twenty years.In 1609 the Jesuits came to Guayra, and found it absolutely untouched;and when in 1631 they left it, it was upon the road to becomeone of the most flourishing American provinces of the Spanish throne.The other missionaries imagined that nothing would persuade the Indiansto depart from their homes, where for so many years they had been happy;but after Montoya explained to them his plans, they all assented to themas with a single voice.The plan by means of which the Jesuit Moses led his sheepout of the wilderness of Guayra was most remarkable.The river Parana forms a great artery between Brazil and Paraguay;upon each side of it a network of rivers disembogue.  The Paranapane,on which most of the missions of Guayra were situated, flows from the east,and falls into the Parana, not much more than fifty milesabove the cataract.  After the last of the once-flourishingsix Jesuit reductions had been evacuated at the orders of Montoya,he collected all the boats, rafts, and canoes, and after much persuasiongot all the Indians persuaded to follow him to seek for safer habitationslower down the Parana.  The population of the six reductionshas been estimated at about one hundred thousand souls; but of these,during the years of 1629 and 1630, thousands had been led captiveto San Paulo, and thousands had dispersed into the woods.Still, assembled on the banks of the Paranapane, there wasa multitude of Indians of every sex and age.  Fortunately or unfortunately,no record by an eye-witness exists,* except that written by Montoya,and he is modest to a fault about all details, and absolutely silentas to the part he played himself.  He tells us that at the starting-pointwere gathered two thousand five hundred families, and thisin spite of the dispersions and the efforts made by the Spanish settlersin the town of Ciudad Real,** who feared, with cause, to be exposedto the full fury of the Paulistas without allies.  It appears the Indianswere in a state of spiritual exaltation, for some young men having remarkedthe Jesuits were packing up a Christ and an image of the Blessed Virgin,which in happier times had been miraculous, they declaredthat to affront exile, and even death, in such good companywas a foretaste of heaven.--* At least, I have been unable to discover any other account  by an eye-witness.** This city was situated near the great falls of Guayra,   and was destroyed by the Paulistas, as well as the city of Villa Rica,   after the Jesuits and their Indians left the province.--Montoya, in opposition to the modern style, tries to shiftthe burden of the praise on to the shoulders of the Provincial,Padre Francisco Lopez Truxillo,*1* but with indifferent success.This matter of bearing your own praise will require regulation in the future,when an advance of civilization has opened people's eyes to the perceptionthat praise is just as disagreeable to the sufferer as is blame.The sentinel whom they had placed to warn them of the enemy's approachgave the alarm.  Montoya sent at once to Ciudad Real for help,but the Spanish settlers were too hard pressed themselves to give assistance.Nothing remained but to make a portage of all their rafts, boats,and canoes, and then to re-embark and sail down the Paranaout of the reach of the Paulistas.  Montoya passed in review his boats,and found he had seven hundred, and that twelve thousand peoplehad embarked with him on leaving the Paranapane.  When the Paulistas foundthe Jesuits had evacuated all their towns, they burnt the churches,on the principle, perhaps, that, the nests once pulled down,the rooks would not return.  They turned the Jesuit cells into barracksfor themselves, taking, as Montoya says with horror, `infamous women'into those chaste abodes, where never woman had passed through the doors.The Paulistas then entered into a rigorous examination*2* of the Jesuits'private lives, hoping to find some scandal to bring against them.Especially they questioned the Indian women, giving them presents to discovereverything they knew.  All was in vain, the discipline of the Order,or the strict conscientiousness of the individual members of it, not havinggiven scandal any hold.*3*  The most difficult part of the great exoduswas now to come.  The rapids and the cataracts of the Parana extendto nearly ninety miles, and the whole country is a maze of tangled forestinterspersed with rocks.  No paths exist, the place is desert,and over the dank mass of vegetation the moisture from the clouds of vapourthrown up by the falling water descends in never-ending rain.*4*In order to endeavour to save the trouble of reconstructingnew rafts and canoes at the bottom of the cataract, Montoya launchedthree hundred empty boats (sending an Indian in advance) to see if any of themwould arrive safely at the bottom of the falls.  Not one escaped;and so the pilgrimage began, almost without provisions and without arms,in the middle of a country quite uncultivated, and where game was scarce.*5*To make things worse, intelligence was brought that, a few miles belowthe beginning of the falls, the Spaniards of Guayra had built a wooden fort,surrounded with a strong stockade, hoping to intercept the retreating Indians,and make slaves of any who might fall into their hands.  Montoya himself,dressed as an Indian, went out to observe the enemy, and on his returnthe whole immense assemblage silently plunged into the woods,leaving so little traces of its passage that the Spaniards in the fortwere still expecting them when they were far beyond their reach.--*1* `Conquista Espiritual', p. 48.*2* `Rigoroso examen' (`Conquista Espiritual').*3* In all the books and pamphlets I have searched about the Jesuits    in Paraguay, both friendly and unfriendly to the Order,    I have never found a charge of personal unchastity advanced    against a Jesuit.  In regard to the other religious Orders    it is far otherwise.*4* Azara, `Descripcion e Historia del Paraguay', tomo i., p. 40:    `En las inmediaciones del Salto hay proporcion para tomar    las medidas geometricas que se quiera y metiendose por el bosque    se puede reconocer lo inferior del Salto, bien que para este    es menester desnudare totalmente porque llueve mucho.'*5* Azara records (book i.) the Indian fable that no living thing    could exist near the cataract.  Though this is of course untrue,    yet in most Paraguayan forests near water, game is both scarce    and hard to find.--Each Indian had to take his bundle on his back; even the childrencarried bundles in proportion to their strength.  The missionaries carriedwhat was held most sacred, as altar-plate and images of saints.In front a band of men armed with machetes (cane-knives)opened the way through the dense woods and pathless jungle of the bank;and as they marched along, Montoya says they sang hymnswhich the Jesuits had taught them, and at the sound of themfugitives who had been hiding in the woods came out and joinedtheir march.  Especially those from the out-station of Tayaobajoined them; their priest, Pedro de Espinosa, had met his death`with a good chance of his eternal welfare,' as Montoya says.*But after the second day the hymns no longer sounded through the woods,nor did they play upon the harps and other instruments,whose strings being all broken and the wood unglued,`they left them on the rocks, being too sad to look at them.'All through the weary journey Montoya seems never once to have despaired,and sets down in his book the adventures of each separate day,never forgetting to chronicle anything strange or patheticas it occurred to him.  On the fourth day he sent off Fathers Diego,Nicolas Hennerio, and Mansilla into the province of Itatinesto found a mission there, acting upon orders which had just reached himfrom the Provincial of the Order shortly before he had started from Guayra.They took with them `bells, images, and everything suitablefor the foundation of a mission'; but the first two were martyredby the wild Indians, and the third just fled in time to save his life.It took the fugitive Indians eight weary days of marchingto reach the lower end of the cataract, where once againthe Parana was navigable.  On their arrival they hoped to findprovisions and more boats; but none were there, their own storeswere almost done, and the people too exhausted to march on.Fever broke out, and many of them died; and others, lost in the forests,without a guide, wandered about till death released them from their march.A weaker man than Padre Montoya might have despaired of ever issuingfrom the woods.  However, he set the Indians to work to make canoes,and others** to cultivate patches of maize for food, working himselfalternately with axe and hoe to give example to the neophytes.Others, again, cut down the enormous canes, which in that regiongrew to fifty feet in height, to make them into rafts.--* `Con buenas prendas de su salud eterna' (`Conquista Espiritual').** Fathers Suarez, Contreras, and Espinosa were Montoya's lieutenants   in this memorable retreat.  It is difficult to give the palm   to the energy and courage of the four priests, or to   the resignation and faith of the immense multitude of Indians   who were saved by them.--So, after a considerable time, all was in readiness for a new start,and luckily provisions from the reductions on the Parana arrived.So they embarked again, and on the journey a raft in whicha woman and two children were sitting upset, to Montoya's agony,as he knew that `in that river there are fish that the people call culebras,*which have been seen to swallow men entire, and throw them out againwith all their bones broken as if it had been done with stones.'He says:  `I confess I suffered infinitely, and, turning my eyes to heaven,I blamed my sins as having been the cause of so much misery,and said, "O Lord, is it possible that for this Thou hast broughtthese people out of their country, that my eyes should endurethe spectacle of so much misery, and my heart break at so much suffering,and then to let them die devoured by savage fish!"'  As the good manwas praying, the Indian woman's head appeared above the water,and Montoya himself, aided by Indians, drew her and the childrenin safety to the land.  But his trials were not at an end,for many of the hastily constructed rafts and canoes sank before his eyes,and the mortality of Indians was great.  Eventually they founda temporary refuge in the Reduction of the Nativity upon the Acaray,and at Santa Maria la Mayor upon the Iguazu.  Then famine raged,and the arrival of so many people increased the scarcity,so that six hundred of the new arrivals died in one reduction,and five hundred in the next.  At last the scarcity became so greatthat the poor Indians had to roam about the forests to gather fruit,and many of them died in the recesses of the woods.--* `Culebra' is the Spanish for a serpent.  These fish may have been waterboas,  or, again, as seems probable by their digestive powers,  some kind of hypothetical fish not yet catalogued.--Seeing no hopes of saving the remainder, Montoya led them further onto the banks of a little river called the Jubaburrus,*and there he once again founded two reductions, which he namedLoreto and San Ignacio, after the two the Mamelucos had destroyed.He bought ten thousand head of cattle out of the money the King allowedto the Jesuits of Guayra, and from the sale of some few objectssaved from the general destruction of the towns, and settled down his Indians,who in Guayra had been all agriculturists, to a pastoral life.Thus did he bring successfully nearly twelve thousand peoplea distance of about five hundred miles through desert country,and down a river broken in all its course by rapids,landing them far from their enemies in a safe haven at the last.Most commonly the world forgets or never knows its greatest men,while its lard-headed fools, who in their lives perhaps have beenthe toys of fortune, sleep in their honoured graves, their memoryliving in the page of history, preserved like grapes in aspicby writers suet-headed as themselves.  But though this Hegirawas the most stirring episode of Montoya's life, he yet had work to do,and in the province of diplomacy rendered as great, or even greater,services to the Indians, whom he loved better than himself,as in the memorable journey when he led them down the Parana.--* The name of this river seems to have passed through the machine  of some medieval typewriter, for it is like no name in any language,  and Montoya knew Guarani well, having written much in that language.--Chapter III  Spain and Portugal in South America -- Enmity between  Brazilians and Argentines -- Expulsion of Jesuits from Paraguay --  Struggles with the natives -- Father Mendoza killed --  Death of Father MontoyaIn the province of Guayra the Spaniards who had looked with disfavouron the Jesuits, and had enslaved the Indians when they were able,were in sore straits.  The Mamelucos, finding no more Indians to enslave,fell on the two towns of Villa Rica and Ciudad Real, destroyed them utterly,and forced the inhabitants to flee for refuge into Paraguay.Thus Guayra went the way of Matto Grosso and several otherprovinces of Spain, and became Portuguese.  Strangely enough,most of these losses happened when Spain and Portugal were joinedunder one crown.  At home the Spaniards and the Portuguese,however much they detested one another, were forced to keep the peace.In America they were always at war, which ended invariablyto the detriment of Spain.*  The strife begun by the Papal Bull of 1493,in which Pope Alexander VI. divided the territoriesdiscovered and to be discovered between Portugal and Spain, went on,till bit by bit Spain was stripped of the provinces of Matto Grosso,Rio Grande, and Guayra, and found herself drawn into the numerous disputesabout the Colonia del Sacramento, which cost so much bloodto both contending Powers.  Perhaps the most curious and interestingincident of the long struggle was the Three Years' War,which began in 1750, after the marriage of Ferdinand VI. of Spainwith Dona Barbara of Portugal.  By the treaty entered into at this marriage,seven of the most flourishing of the missions situatedon the left bank of the Uruguay were ceded to Portugalin exchange for La Colonia del Sacramento on the river Plate.The towns resisted change of sovereignty, as Portugal to themwas typified by the Paulistas, their most inveterate enemies.The Marquis de Valdelirios in his curious despatches touches muchupon this war, but perhaps the best account is to be foundin the curious memoir of the Irish Jesuit Father, Tadeo Hennis,**who was the backbone of the resisting Guaranis.--* Even so late as the year 1777, in which the last treaty of boundaries  was signed at San Ildefonso, Portugal was the gainer, though not so greatly  as by the former treaties of 1681 and 1750.** `Efemerides o Diario de la Guerra de los Guaranies', por P. Tadeo Hennis.   This journal has, I think, never been published in its entirety,   but portions of it are to be found in the collection of documents,   Bulls, despatches, etc., published at Madrid in 1768   under the title of `Causa Jesuitica de Portugal'.  The author of this book   calls Hennis a German, but his name, Thadeus Ennis (as it is often spelt),   and his love of fighting look un-Germanic.  Portions of the diary   are also to be found in the work of Bernardo Ibanez de Echegarray,   entitled `Histoire du Paraguay sous les Je/suites' (Amsterdam, 1780).   Either the original or an old manuscript copy exists   in the archives of Simancas, where I have seen, but unfortunately   did not examine, it.  A portion of the work is also included   in the `Coleccion de Angelis' (Buenos Ayres, 1836).--The ancient enmity of the two nations has been continued in their descendants,the Brazilians and the Argentines and Uruguayans, and little by littleBrazil is absorbing all the northern portion of the Republic of Uruguay.After the retreat under Montoya down the Parana, the Jesuit missions,especially in Paraguay and what is now the province of Corrientes,for some time enjoyed a period of peace and of repose, and the strangepolicy of the Jesuits was developed, and township after township aroseamongst the Guaranis (1630-31).  But there was still no restfor Ruiz Montoya, who was of those who rest but in the grave.  In 1632,at the instance of the Governor and magistrates of the township of Jerez,Montoya sent Fathers Jean Ranconier and Mansilla to the north of Paraguayto found a mission amongst the Itatines, a forest-dwelling tribe.Their territory was marshy and the climate bad, and woods of indiarubber-treescovered all the land.  Fathers del Techo and Charlevoixboth speak of the `rebounding balls' with which they played,which, thrown upon the ground, start up again as if they were filled with air.This is, perhaps, one of the first times that indiarubber is mentioned,though in some places Jean de Lery* seems to indicate he was acquaintedwith its use.--* `Histoire d'un Voyage faict en la Terre du Bre/sil'.--The Jesuits found that to make progress was not easy with these Indians,who willingly enough listened to their preaching, but refused to altertheir social habits, to which the Jesuits ascribe the fact that even thentheir numbers were diminishing.  Like most of the Indians of America,they were polygamists, which custom in their race operates differently topolygamy amongst the negroes:  for whereas they seem to increase and thrive,the Indians even at the conquest often tended to become extinct.When a headman amongst the Itatines died, a number of his followersjumped down precipices to accompany him upon his journey to a better world.This custom and polygamy gave much trouble to the Jesuits,but their most admirable patience and knowledge of mankind helped themto overcome them by degrees.  All was about to flourish in the mission,when one Acosta, a Brazilian priest, appeared.  Perhaps he was in leaguewith the Paulistas, or perhaps was jealous of the Jesuits, for he tried hardto lead a number of the Indians to San Paulo to show them (as he said)how they should follow the true law of God.*--* The way of the neophyte even to-day is hard, so many priests  of different jarring sects disputing for his soul as hotly as if  it were a preference stock which they had private intimation  was just about to rise.--The Itatines, either suspecting that Acosta's true law was false,or tired of his preaching, rose and killed him; but the effect was bad,and there grew up amongst those infidels a coldness even towardsthe Jesuits themselves.  Had it not been for two miraculous eventswhich happened opportunely, as such things should happenif they are to be turned to good account, much harm might have been done.A chief, having cursed a priest, was seized at once with a malignant ulcerin the throat, which shortly killed him.  The Itatines did not apparentlythink anything of the influence of the unhealthy climate in which they lived,and set the occurrence down to the act of God.But more was still to come.  Another chief having so far forgotten himselfas to jeer at a priest, a thunderbolt fell so close to himthat he was knocked senseless, and lay as dead.  These two events confirmedthe Jesuits' power, and things began to flourish in their four new missions.But the Great Power, so careful of the individual effort of His priests,seems to have been most unaccountably remiss of their success consideredas a whole.  In the same year (1632) the Mamelucos appeared and ruinedall the four missions, so that the efforts of the Jesuits and the miracleswere lost.In 1633 the first skirmish took place between the Bishop of Paraguayand the Jesuits.  This skirmish little by little grew into a war,kept up for more than a hundred years, and ended finallyin the expulsion of the Jesuits from Paraguay.  The Governor,Don Luis de Cespedes, having called upon the Indians of the Jesuit missionsfor personal service, a proceeding quite against boththe King's orders and the Papal Bulls, the Bishop thought the momentopportune to press for tithes.  This, too, was equally forbiddenboth by a Bull and by an order of the Council of the Indies.  Padre Romerowent to Asuncion and displayed his Bulls and his orders of the Council,and the Governor withdrew his claims.  The Bishop, after some opposition,withdrew likewise, and the Provincial of the Order arrived at Asuncion,bringing with him an order from the King signifying thatthe Indians of the reductions were to be left entirely to the Jesuits.So for the present the Jesuits scored a victory, though in the futureit was to cost them dear.  But the Governor of Paraguayhaving returned apparently to his design of exacting personal servicefrom the Indians of the missions, the Provincial checkmated himwith a royal order from Philip IV.  The order was addressedto the Viceroy of Peru, the fourth Count of Chinchon.  The missive,dated at Madrid in 1633, condemned in the strongest termsall personal service (that is, forced labour) amongst the Indians,not only of the Jesuit missions, but of Peru and Mexico.With a touching confidence in his own powers, and absolute right Divine,the well-meaning King added to his orders a paragraph commandingall to be done as he had ordered within six months.  Strange to findPhilip IV., whom Velasquez has immortalized and shown us as he sat uponhis horse ineffable, so far away from the Museo del Prado, where alonehe ever seems really to have lived.  But foolish Governors and Bishopswere not the Jesuits' worst enemies in Paraguay.  In 1634 the Provincial,Father Boroa, was shipwrecked in a voyage up the Uruguay, and only savedby the devotion of his neophytes.Sometimes the cruel treatment of the natives by the Spanish settlerswas avenged upon the Jesuits.  This was the case with a band of Guapalaches,who, coming on Father Espinosa in a wood, attacked and massacredhim and all his Indians, and, having cut his body into pieces,left it for the wild beasts to eat.  Upon another occasion Father Mendozafell into an ambuscade, from which he might have escaped had not his horsesunk in a miry stream.  Long he defended himself with an Indian shield,but at length was stretched upon the ground and left for dead.During the night he revived, and dragged himself up to some rocks;but the Indians in the morning, following up his trail, came on himpraying in a loud voice.  They told him that he served a blind God,or at best a powerless God, as He did nothing to defend His servant;then, after torturing him cruelly, they despatched him,and, taking out his heart, said:  `Let us see if his soulwill take the road to heaven.'  These savages do not seem to have beengenuinely interested in finding out what became of the soulafter the dissolution of the body, for they sat down and madea hearty meal of two young Indians who accompanied the unlucky priest.But they had heard their victim say that when he baptized themit purified their souls, and the last words of Father Mendoza had beento recommend his soul to God.  I often wonder if the Christians of to-day,their creed so firmly fixed by the martyrdoms of simple folk,who held their faith without perhaps much reasoning on it,know what they owe to men like Father Christopher Mendoza,slain by the Indians in the Paraguayan woods.  Your ancient martyr,fallen out of fashion and forgotten by the Christians of to-day,should have his homage done to him, if only by the chance writer,who in his studies for some subject of no interest to the general worldcomes on his trail of blood; for martyrdom, no matter how obscure,forgotten by the people of the faith for which the martyr suffered,is a slur not only on the faithful, but on the faith itself.  In 1636 occurredthe second invasion of the Paulistas, which induced Father Montoya,accompanied by Father Diaz Tano, to go to Europe to seek protectionfor the Indians both from the King of Spain and from the Pope.The Mamelucos burst into the province of Tape,* and,as the mission of Jesus-Maria (one of the few left undestroyedat the former invasion) was most exposed, Father Romero askedpermission of the Governor of the River Plate** to make some trenchesto defend the place.  The Governor consented, but the storm burston the mission before the defences were in a fit state to defend.The mission priests Antonio Bernal and Juan Cardenas were in the front ranksencouraging the Indians, and both were badly wounded.  Fathers Mola and Romerowent about ministering to the wounded, but escaped themselves.  At last,the Mamelucos having set fire to the church, capitulation became inevitable,and the chief part of the Indians were led away in chains.The same fate would have overtaken the mission of San Cristobal,where father Romero had retreated with some fugitives from Jesus-Maria,had not the people and their priest retreated hastily uponthe mission of Santa Ana.  But even there they were not long in safety,and had to undertake another perilous journey down the river Iguai.Here a party of passing Mamelucos fell into an ambuscade,and were hewn in pieces, presumably before the Lord.  The Mamelucospushed their advance so far that Father Montoya had given ordersthat all the missions of that province should be burned.  The inhabitants,who trusted him quite blindly, were just about to begin to burn their houses,when an order from the Provincial stopped them from doing so till he himselfappeared upon the scene.  He arrived, and, gathering up the scattered Indiansas far as he was able, left them for safety in some of the missionswhich had not been destroyed, and set off himself to ask for helpfrom the Governor of Paraguay.--* This province was sometimes called Guayra, and sometimes La Provincia  de Vera, Vera being the family name of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca.  Its position, etc., may be determined by reference to  the curious volume of maps published at Madrid by Don Francisco Javier Brabo  in 1872.** That a mission could be so undefended as to need trenches,   that a Jesuit should ask leave to make such elementary defences,   even in the face of imminent danger, seems to prove that the Jesuits   at least in 1636 had no intention of defying the sovereign power,   as was so often alleged against them.--Finding no help either from him or from the Governor of the River Plate,he went to Corrientes, and was received almost with contumely.Then, desperate, he equipped an army of the mission Indians,and advanced to fight the Mamelucos; but they had retreated into Brazil,and were beyond his reach.  Seeing that nothing was to be hopedfrom the Spanish Governors, he sent a box of papers in a shipgoing to Portugal, and laid his case before the Council of the Indies.Montoya and Charlevoix relate that the box was thrown into the sea near Lisbonby some enemy of the Jesuits, but providentially was washed up by the tide,and, being found miraculously, was taken to the King of Spain.Whether this happened as it is written, who shall say?  But, in distress,when have good men (before the time of the encyclopaedists)been without a miracle to sustain their cause?  In the next year (1637)Father Montoya and Tano started upon their mission to Europe,and a new field was opened to Montoya in which to show his talentson the Indians' behalf.Whilst Father Montoya was in Spain, the Provincial appointed Father Alfaroto take his place.  He fell on troublous times, for the Mamelucoswere preparing to attack the three remaining missionsin the province of Guayra.*  As they were not defensible,it was agreed to evacuate them, and to retreat into the provincesupon the Uruguay.  When they were just about to start from Santa Teresa,where the inhabitants of the other missions had been collected,the Mamelucos appeared just before Christmas.  The Indians were driven offas slaves, and the Mamelucos, with their usual sense of humour,attended Mass as penitents on Christmas Day, with candles in their hands,and listened to the sermon in an edifying way.  The priest reproached themfor their cruelty, and they, after listening devoutly, gave himthe liberty of two choir boys, and quietly left the church.--* San Joaquin, Santa Teresa, Santa Ana.--At length the Jesuits, rendered desperate by the perils to whichthe mission Indians were exposed, armed several bands of Indians and attackedthe Mamelucos.  But, as was to be expected, the half-armed Indianswere always worsted by the well-armed and disciplined Paulista bands,and then the Jesuits took the supreme resolve to evacuate Guayra entirely,and place the Indians in safety between the rivers Parana and Uruguay.Formed into three great companies, the Indians started on their second exodus.Although the difficulties were less than in the voyage down the Parana,still, to march several thousand Indians just emerged from savagery,accompanied by their women and children, and charged withall their possessions, through a wild country, where they were exposedto the attack of a well-armed enemy upon the way, was not an easy task.Father Christobal Arenas formed them into three divisions,leading the first himself; but the Provincial seems to have donemost of the organizing, for Charlevoix says that `to his courage, prudence,and inalterable kindness,' the success was due.*--* `Histoire du Paraguay', liv. ix., p. 446.--Courage and prudence and inalterable kindness are the three virtueswhich have most moved the world; perhaps the last has been most efficacious,and one would hope that in the future it would be the only oneof the whole three required.Twelve thousand Indians, not counting women and children,were thus led into a territory* between the rivers Uruguay and Parana,rich, fertile, and, as the distance between the riversis not above some five-and-twenty miles, defended in some measure,and easily rendered almost impregnable.--* This territory is now the Argentine province of Misiones.--No one can see the heart of man, and, even if God sees it,He never tells us what is there, so that we are obliged to judge of actionsas we find them, and leave the search for motives to omniscients.On the face of it, the Jesuits, both those who led the Indiansdown the Parana and those who headed them in this migrationto the Mesopotamia between the Uruguay and Parana, were not impelledby thought of gain; and if a Jesuit must of necessity have some dark schemebehind the smallest action of his life, these men concealed it so deep downwithin their souls that all the researches of their keenest enemieshave not been able to throw light on it.  But, even settledin their new homes, the Indians were defenceless against the Mamelucos,as it was a state maxim of the Spanish court that the Indiansshould never be allowed the use of guns.  This was a wise enough precaution,without doubt, for the Indians of the Encomiendas, who livedamongst the Spaniards and owed them personal services;but arms for the Indians of the missions were a necessity of life.Therefore, before he started for Madrid, the Provincial impressed upon Montoyato approach the Council of the Indies and the King, and represent to themthat it was impossible to guarantee the existence of the reductionsagainst the Mamelucos unless the Indians were allowed to provide themselveswith arms.  So Father Montoya, though he was charged to pressfor various reforms, was most especially impressed upon this point.He was to tell the King that the Indians were not to be allowedto keep their arms themselves, but that they would be kept by the Jesuits,and served out to the Indians in case of an attack; then, that the armswould not cost a penny to the treasury, but be all paid out of the almscollected for the purpose by the Company; lastly, and this wasa true stroke of Jesuit policy, that, to instruct the Indians how to shoot,they would bring from Chile certain Jesuits who in the world had servedas soldiers.  One sees them brought from the frontiers of Araucania,and from the outposts of the trans-Andean towns, half sacristan,half sergeant, instant in prayer, and yet with a look about themlike a serious bull terrier -- a fitting kind of priest for a frontier town,and such as could alone be found amongst the Jesuits.About this time (1639) the third invasion of the Mamelucos took place,and Father Alfaro, who had been left in charge of the missionson the Uruguay and Parana, was shot by a Mameluco with a crossbow,and fell dead from his horse.  The Governor of Paraguay, on hearing of it,marched with an army, and, having killed two or three hundredof the Mamelucos, took the rest prisoners, and carried themback to Asuncion.  There, to the disgust of all the Jesuit historians,he menaced them with the wrath of Heaven and let them go.The feelings of a churchman, when his own privilege is thus usurped,may be compared to those of a strict game-preserver who seeshis coverts poached.  It is not so much the damage that is doneas the personal insult and the humiliation which he suffers in his pride.In this year, too, the Indians of the missions renderedtheir first armed service to the State which afterwards so oftendrew on them in its necessity and treated them so ill.The Governor of Buenos Ayres, Don Pedro Estevan Davila,was setting out upon an expedition against a tribe of Indianswho had taken refuge in the islands of the Lake Ybera.Eighty of the Indians were sent, and, being well led and armed,contributed considerably towards success.  Next year a second contingentwas required by the Governor of Tucuman, and duly sent to his assistance.History seems to repeat itself, and foolish soldiers and othersnever to gain experience; for the Governor (Padre del Techoin his `Historia Paraquaiae' tells us), having made war in Flanders,could never be dissuaded that the same system was not suitablefor warfare in America.  Accordingly, he set out in good order,but neglected to send out scouts, and consequently fell intothe middle of the Calchaquis strongly entrenched within a marsh,attacked them with a rush, lost heavily, and had to retire to Tucuman.But all this time Father Montoya and Diaz Tano were strivingin Rome and at Madrid with the Pope and with the King.Urban VIII., at that time God's vicegerent for the Christian portionof the world, received Diaz Tano kindly, listened to all he had to saywith interest, promised him his help, and gave him a Papal lettermenacing the Mamelucos with the wrath of God.  From Rome Father Tanowent to Madrid, and thence to Lisbon, whence he sailed armed withthe protection of the Pope and accompanied by a fresh band of zealous priests.Arrived in Rio de Janeiro, he published the Papal letter, and fixed iton the doors of the Jesuit College and on those of their church.  He seemson this occasion to have been wanting in the chief Jesuit virtue, prudence,or at the least he seems to have mistaken the character of the peopleamongst whom he was.  Most of the colonists having relationswith the Mamelucos were indignant, and a mob broke in the doorsboth of the college and of the church.  The riot grew so seriousthat the Governor convoked a council, and cited Father Tano to appear.He came and spoke, and in the eyes of the chief people of the placemade out his case; but the multitude, caring not much for reason(and nothing for philanthropy), became more furious, but was appeased at lastby a petition being sent in protest to the Pope.But if these things passed in Rio de Janeiro (which Del Techo refers toas `oppido sanctorum'), what was the fury of the people in San Paulo,the very centre of the Mamelucos, when the Vicar-General published the briefby order of Don Pedro Albornoz!  The people rose immediately,and menaced the Vicar-General with instant death unless he instantlywithdrew the brief.  This he refused to do, although forced on his kneesand with a naked sword held at his throat.  His courage quieted them,and they drew up an appeal which they tried hard to make him sign,but he again refused.  The mob, having demanded the brief,was told it was in the college of the Jesuits.  Thither they went post-haste,and were met upon the steps by the Superior, dressed in canonicals and holdingthe holy wafer in his hand.  He spoke, and most of them fell prostrateon the ground before the Body of our Lord.  Others stood upright,and said that, whilst they adored the Holy Sacrament with their whole souls,they would not suffer that their slaves, who were their chiefest property,should be set free.  An atheist (or some kind of Protestant) cried outto fire upon the priest, but he had no support.  The Superior then gave thema copy of the brief, and they returned to the Vicar-Generalto ask for absolution for any censure of the Church they might have incurred;but he for the third time was obdurate, and let them welter in their sin.The news of the revolution which liberated Portugal from Spainhaving just reached the town, the Jesuits had to retreat from it,leaving the inhabitants enraged against them and more determined than beforeto push their forays into Paraguay.  But the time was pastfor their incursions, for Father Ruiz Montoya had prospered at Madrid,and secured even more than he had hoped for when he started on his quest.On arriving at Madrid, which he did after a prosperous journey of four months,he waited on the King (Philip IV.), and laid before him and commissarieschosen from the Indies and Castile the following points:1.  That the law of 1611, which provided that no Indians, unless takenin a just war, should be reduced to slavery, should be put into effect.2.  That the Pope should be approached to confirm the briefsof Paul III. and Clement VIII., which contained the same provisions.3.  That those who did not conform to these instructionsshould be handed over to the Inquisition to be judged.4.  That the Indians who had been enslaved by the Paulistasshould be at once set free and the aggressors punished.The King after deliberation granted every point, and, further,regulated the tribute which the Indians were to pay.*  All this was easyto enact, but, like most other laws, not quite so easy to put into effect.Moreover, as the revolution which separated Portugal from Spainhad just occurred, all Spanish thunder against the Mamelucoswas of but small account.  Montoya then pressed the demandfor license to use firearms in self-defence against the Mamelucos.The King after deliberation granted this last point, and from that timethe incursions of the Mamelucos ceased in Paraguay and generallythroughout the mission territory.  Then also there was set on footthat Jesuit militia which rendered such good service to the crown,but was the cause of so much murmuring, as it protected the mission Indiansboth from the Paulistas and from the inroads of the Spanish colonists.--* This seems to prove the malice of those who set about  that the Indians of the missions paid no taxes to the Crown.--Father Montoya never returned to Paraguay, where he had fought so longand done so much for the poor Indians.  Apparently it was not writtenthat he should see the results of all his efforts, for, having embarkedat Seville for Peru, he was detained at Lima on business of the Order.From thence he went to Tucuman, and, having returned to Lima,died aged seventy.  The Viceroy and the chief members of the Audiencia(with whom he had struggled all his life) accompanied his body to the grave,and it is said that several miracles showed forth the gloryhe enjoyed in heaven.That may be so, and if they happened (as they well may have done,for, after all, a miracle* really exists for those who credit it),if Heaven has honoured him, 'tis more than man has done:for even in Paraguay his name is not remembered, though it remains enshrinedin the neglected pages of many a dusty Latin or a Spanish book.--* Vieyra, the great Portuguese Jesuit, said that all miracles  were possible to God, but yet that he had never heard that our Lord  had ever cured anyone of folly.--But all the time that Fathers Montoya and Diaz Tano were in Europea serious danger to the Jesuits was growing up.  At the discoveryof the New World, the Franciscans had been the first of all the Ordersto go out.  Some had accompanied Columbus, some were with Cortes in Mexico.Almagro and Pizarro's hosts had their Franciscan chaplains.In his commentaries, Alvar Nunez relates how he met some of the Orderin Brazil.  Lastly, the first of all the saints of the New Worldwas a Franciscan.In 1638 the Franciscans in the province of Jujuy* disputed with the Jesuitsthe right to certain missions, accusing them, as Padre del Techo says,`of putting their sickle into their ripening corn.'**What could be more annoying if it were true?  As if a Wesleyan missionin the Paumotus Group should, after having shed its Bibles and its blanketslike dry leaves, suddenly find an emissary from Babylon itselfarrive and mark the sheep!--* Now a province of the Argentine Republic.** `Historia Paraquariae', book xii., cap. xii.--But from Jujuy the dissensions spread to Paraguay, where the Franciscanshad several missions extending from Yuti to Cazapa, thus beingalmost within touch of the Jesuit Gospellers in Santa Maria,upon the eastern bank of the Tebicuari, which bounds their territory.These jealousies might have gone smouldering on, and never burst outinto fire, had not the appointment of a Franciscan to the see of Paraguaycaused the flames to flare out fiercely.Had a firebrand been wanted to stir up strife, none bettercould have been found than Don Bernardino de Cardenas, who was just thenappointed to the bishopric of Paraguay.Chapter IV  Don Bernardino de Cardenas, Bishop of Paraguay -- His labours  as apostolic missionary -- His ambitions and cunning --  Pretensions to saintliness -- His attempts to acquire supreme power --  Quarrels between Cardenas and Don Gregorio, the temporal GovernorDon Bernardino de Cardenas first saw the light in the town of La Plata,*capital of the province of Charcas in Bolivia, or, as it was then called,Alta Peru.  The date of his birth is uncertain, but it would appearto have been in the early years of the seventeenth century.  At an early agehe entered the Franciscan Order.--* La Plata was sometimes called Chuquisaca, and is to-day known as Sucre.--As the Franciscans had had the honour of having furnished to the calendarthe first saint canonized in the New World, it seems to have beenthe dream of Cardenas from his earliest youth to emulate him.In this desire he seems to have acted in good faith,and all his life the dream of saintship haunted him.Charlevoix* says `he made a rather superficial study of theology,and then engaged in preaching, in which, with memory, assurance, and facility,he found it easy to succeed in a country where brilliant giftsare more esteemed than solid learning.'  Certainly a preacherwithout assurance, memory, and facility would scarcely have succeededin any country; and in what country in the world is brilliancynot far esteemed above the deepest scholarship?  Besides, `he wasa man of visions (`homme a\ visions') and revelations, which hetook good care to publish.'  Visions are generally, in the case of saints,confined to the soul's eye, and revelation to the inward ear;if, therefore, the recipient of them does not make them known,they run the risk of being lost.  In a word, according to Charlevoix,**he was `one of the most complete and dangerous ecstatics that ever lived.'`His first successes' (whether as preacher or ecstatic are not specified)caused his superiors to name him guardian of their college of La Plata.They soon repented of their choice.  No sooner was he named Superiorthan he sought to qualify himself for saintship by a sort of royal road.Saints are of several classes, and, in looking through the calendars,it strikes one how different seem to have been the methods by whichthey severally attained their goal.--* `Histoire du Paraguay', vol. i., book ix., p. 478.** Charlevoix, vol. i., book xi.  Dean Funes, in his   `Ensayo de la Historia Civil de Paraguay, Buenos Ayres y Tucuman',   vol. ii., book iii., p. 10 (Buenos Ayres, 1816), says of him:   `Se adquirio/ muy en breve una reputacion mas brillante que solida.'--Prince Juan Manuel, in the preface to his `Fifty Pleasant Storiesof Patronio', says that, `amongst the many strange things our Lord God made,He thought good to make one marvellous in special -- that is, that,of the numberless men who are on earth, not one entirely resembles any otherin his face.'  He might have said the same of saints and of their ways.One, like St. Francis of Assisi, treats his father (as it seems to me)but scurvily, and yet to every other created man and all the animals he isa brother.  The saint of Avila founds convents, mingles with men of business,and has visions in the intervals of her journeying through Spain upon an ass.Again, another preaches to the Indians or the Japanese,gives up his substance, begs his bread from door to door,and leaves the devil's advocate scarcely a quillet or a quiddity against him.Lastly, you find against the names of some merely the docket`virgin' or `martyr', as their case or sex may serve.Don Bernardino adopted none of these methods of procedure.Carrying a heavy cross, with ashes on his head and shoulders bared,followed by all his priests, he sallied out one day to discipline himselfin public.  This plan did not succeed with all the world,for his superiors ordered him to remain inside his convent gates.There he remained, and, as his Life informs us, profited by his retreatto study Holy Scriptures, and to such good effect that,the next time he preached, he charmed his hearers by his eloquence.Soon after this the Archbishop of La Plata held a provincial council,with the object of reforming the morals of the Indians in his diocese.Cardenas, being a fluent speaker, was chosen for the postof Apostolic Missionary.  From this time dates the beginning of his fame.In those days all the Indians of the Charcas, and generally of all Peru,were sunk in misery, but little removed from slaves, and their religionwas a mixture of Christianity and paganism -- just the kind of folka fluent preacher of the style of Cardenas could work upon.All through the province he made his apostolic progress,preaching, converting, and confessing, everywhere preceded by his fameas seer of visions, miracle-worker, and recipient of celestial light.He took his way, dressed like a pilgrim, on foot, carrying a wooden cross,and followed by a multitude of Indians from town to town.Religion in America (Catholic or Protestant) has always tended to revertto the original Eastern form, from which, no doubt, it sprung.  The influenceof the vast plains and forests, and the great distances to travel,have introduced the system of camp meetings amongst the Protestants,whereas the Catholics have often held a sort of ambulatory mission,the people of one village following the preacher to the next, and so on,in the same fashion as in Palestine the people seem to have followedJohn the Baptist.Soon the news was spread about that the Indians who followed Cardenas hadtold him of rich mines, on the condition that he would not divulge the secretto the Spaniards.  At that time the search for mines was carriedalmost to madness in Peru.  Even to-day, in almost every mining town,a mysterious, poverty-stricken man sometimes approaches youwith great precaution, and, drawing from his pocket an objectwrapped in greasy paper, declares with oaths that it is `rosicler'(red silver ore), and that he knows where there are tons and tons of it.In Mexico the curious class of miners known as `gambusinos'rove through the valleys of the Sierra Madre armed with pick and pan,passing their lives in hunting mines, as pigs hunt truffles.If they come upon a mine, they never try to work it, but sell the secretfor a trifling sum, and, drinking out the money, start on again to findthe mines worked by the Aztecs, till an Apache bullet or arrow stops them,their El Dorado still ahead, or they are found beside their pick and shoveldead of thirst.Neither in Mexico nor in Peru do things grow less in telling,and we may well suppose the stories of the mines the Indians told to Cardenasbecame colossal; for at last the Alcalde of Cochabamba wrote on the subjectto the Count of Salvatierra, the Viceroy of Peru.As Charlevoix says, `it seemed as if it all worked to the advantageof the holy missionary, who, not content with saving souls, did not forgetthe interests of his native land.'  In the middle of his triumphs,being recalled to Lima, no one doubted that it was in orderto confer with the Viceroy about the supposititious mines.  Others, again,imagined that a mitre was destined for the successful evangelist,and therefore many, even quite poor people, pressed forward to offer fundsto help him on his way.  With quite apostolic assurance,he took all that was offered to him, being certain, as some think,that, the mines being real, he could some day repay with usuryall he had borrowed, or, as others said, being indifferentabout the matter, and trusting to repay in that better countrywhere no usury exists and where no gold corrupts.The Viceroy, being a man of little faith, sent to investigatethe supposititious mines, but found them non-existent.The superiors of Cardenas, as judicious as the higher officersof the Franciscan Order often proved themselves throughout America,informed him that he had given offence to many by hispublic scourgings and processions carrying a cross, and, most of all,that in his sermons propositions had escaped him of a naturelikely to bring him under the censure of the Holy Office.A convent in Lima was assigned to him as a retreat and place of meditationon the virtues of submission and obedience.As we may well believe, no man who felt he had the stuff within himselfto make a saint ever cared much for obedience or submission, except in others;so in his convent, instead of meditating on his faults, he passed his timein writing a memorial to the Council of the Indies, setting forth his viewson the way in which to spread the gospel amongst the Indians.Nothing was better calculated to win him favour.  Every Indian baptizedwas so much yearly gain to the Spanish Government.Conversion and taxation always went hand-in-hand, and thereforeIndians who, unbaptized, brought nothing to the treasury,having received the Gospel truths, were taxed so much a headto show them that from thenceforth they were Christians.Thus, we find that in the Paraguayan missions each Indian paida dollar every year as a sort of poll-tax, and most of the disputesbetween the Viceroys of Paraguay and the Jesuits arose fromthe number of the Indians taxable.  The Viceroys always allegedthat the population of the missions never increased, on account of the Jesuitsreturning false numbers to avoid the tax.Cardenas specially inculcated, in his memorial to the Council of the Indies,that it was not expedient to place the Indians under the regular clergy,a theory of which he himself was destined to become a great antagonist.Promotion, as we know, cometh neither from the east nor from the west;so it fell out that during his retreat, through the influence of his friendDon Juan de Solorzano, a celebrated lawyer, who had heard him preachwhen Governor of Guancavelico, he found himself named Bishop of Asunciondel Paraguay.  This piece of luck opened the doors of his convent to him,and he repaired at once to Potosi to wait the arrival of the Papal Bullauthorizing him to take possession of his bishopric.  There he appearedin the habit of his Order, a little wooden cross upon his breast,and a green hat upon his head, a costume which, if not quite fittingto his new dignity, was at least suited to the Indian taste.His biographer informs us that, without a word to anyone,he began to preach and hear confessions.  Being absolutely without resources,he was reduced to distribute indulgences and little objects of piety,and at the end of every sermon to send his green hat round the audience.His talent for preaching stood him in good stead, and after every sermongifts were showered upon him, and a crowd accompanied him home.The priest of Potosi being just dead, Don Bernardino took his placewithout permission, and set himself up in the double characterof parish priest and Bishop to hold a visitation throughout the diocese.Some people took this conduct as evidence of his saint-like humilityin condescending, though a Bishop, to officiate as a mere priest.The Archbishop had a different opinion, but, as Don Bernardinohad a great following, he thought it best to dissemble his resentment.Cardenas himself, by his imprudence, furnished the Archbishop with an excuseto get him out of the bishopric.A rich Indian, whom Cardenas confessed upon his death-bed, left himten thousand crowns.  Not content with that, he influenced one Diego Vargasto change his will and leave him money.  On this the Archbishop wrote to him,requesting that he would go and govern his own see.  He had to go,but left the town, which he had entered without a farthing,with a long train of mules carrying his money, plate, and furniture.Why he did not instantly go to Asuncion is not quite clear,for in America it was the custom, owing to the great distance from Rome,that Bishops, on receipt of the royal order of appointment,got themselves chosen by the chapter of their diocese to govern provisionally.Instead of doing that, he went to Tucuman, and thence to Salta,where he arrived in 1641.In Salta, his first visit was to the Jesuit college, where he laid his casebefore the Jesuit fathers, and showed them several letters,one from the Cardinal Antonio Barberini dated in 1638,and another from the King without a date, naming him Bishop of Asuncion.On the strength of these two letters he asked the Jesuitsif he could get himself consecrated without the Papal Bulls.Charlevoix alleges that they dared not refuse to answerin the way he wished.  Why this was so is not so easy to make out,as, even with his green hat and wooden cross, he could not at that timehave been a formidable personage.  Their written opinionhe sent at once to the rector of the Jesuit college at Cordova,asking for his opinion and that of the doctors of the university.The answer reached him in Santiago del Estero, and was unfavourable.On reading the letter, Cardenas fell into a most unsaint-like fury,and tore it up without communicating it to anyone, not evento the Bishop of Tucuman, Don Melchior Maldonado.  This was not strange,as he had counted on this Bishop to consecrate him.Notwithstanding what was at stake, he went on in the diocese of Tucumanjust as he had done in that of Charcas, preaching, confessing,and celebrating Mass.  Don Melchior Maldonado, a quiet man of no pretensions,wrote him a letter in which he said:  `You came into my dioceselike a St. Bernard; such is the reputation you have for holiness and preachingthat my people pay me no respect, and only look on me as a manof common virtue and mediocre talents.  Although I hope I am not jealous,still, I must remind you that you act as if you were St. Paul.'A Bishop of common virtue and of mediocre talents is, of course,a Bishop lost, and one can well conceive that poor Don Melchior Maldonadowas placed in an unpleasant position during the stay of Cardenasin his diocese.  Such were Don Bernardino's powers of persuasionthat at last the Bishop consecrated him.  The ceremony was hardly over,when a letter arrived from the Rector of the University of Cordovaadvising Bishop Maldonado against the consecration.  Unluckily for Paraguay,it was too late to undo the action, and Cardenas was now in a positionto take possession of his see.  Poor Melchior Maldonado, Bishop of Tucuman,had, as it happened, laid hands a little hastily upon the candidate.The Council of Trent pronounced upon the case, and found`that the consecration of the Bishop of Paraguay had been a valid oneas touching the sacrament (ordination), and the impression of the character,but that it had been void as regards the power of discharging the functionsattaching to the dignity, and that the Bishop and his consecratorhad need of absolution, which the same holy congregation thinksought to be accorded with the good pleasure of the Pope.'As the same holy congregation had previously declaredthe taking possession of the diocese by Cardenas had been illegal,it is difficult for ordinary minds to grasp their real opinion of the case.Finding that he had failed with the University of Cordova,Don Bernardino took his way to Santa Fe, from whence he wrotean insulting letter to the poor rector.  The letter was conceivedin such outrageous terms that the Bishop of Tucuman wrote in expostulation,saying he expected to see something extraordinary happen in Paraguayif he gave way to such excess of passion.Don Bernardino's usual luck attended him in Santa Fe.  This town then formedpart of the diocese of Buenos Ayres, though situated about four hundred milesfrom the metropolis.  It happened that the see of Buenos Ayres was vacant,and the chapter of the cathedral invited Cardenas to visitthat portion of the diocese through which he had to pass.Cardenas was, of course, delighted to show his talents for preaching,as he had done before in Charcas and in Potosi.  When he arrived at Corrientesthe enthusiasm for his holiness and talents was extraordinary.In Corrientes, Don Bernardino seems to have felt, for the first time,his calling and election really sure.  At the time he landed (1642)the land was sunk in ignorance and superstition.  Even to-day in Corrientes(the city of the seven currents), situated just at the junction of the riversParana and Paraguay, close to the celebrated missions of the Jesuits,the inhabitants, living in a country almost tropical,are half Indians in type.What Corrientes looked like in Don Bernardino's timeis matter of conjecture.  Perhaps it was not greatlydifferent from some remote Spanish-American frontier townssome five-and-twenty years ago, save for the groups of Spanish soldiery,with their steel morions, trunk hose and heavy arquebuses lounging about,and in the matter of the scarcity of horses in the streets.No doubt the self-same listless air hung over everything,and in the place of the modern blue and white barred flagswith a rising sun or cap of liberty stuck like a trade-mark in the corner,the blood and orange Spanish colours with the quarteringsof castles and of lions flapped heavily against the flagstaff of the fort.The Indian women dressed all in white, their hair cutsquare across the forehead and hanging down their backs,sat with their baskets of fruit and flowers in the market-place.  The town,as now, built chiefly of adobes, with a few wooden huts dotted about,was semi-oriental in design.  On every church were cupolasafter the eastern fashion, flat roofs on every house, and everythingshone dazzling white against the dark, metallic-looking foliage of the trees.The streets, as now, were sandy water-courses, crossed here and therewith traverses of rough-hewn stone to break the force of the waterin the season of the rains.At night the fireflies glistened amongst the heavy leavesof the mamayes and the orange-trees, whilst from the Chaco rosethe mysterious voices of the desert night, and from the outskirts of the townthe wailing Indian Jarabis and Cielitos sung in a high falsetto keyto the tinkling of a cracked guitar, but broken now and thenby the sharp warning cry `Alerta centinela!' of the soldiers on the walls.Could one have landed there, one would have felt much as a sailor feels,dropped on the beach of Eromango or on some yet unbemissionaried islandof the Paumotus Group.Embarking from Corrientes up the river Paraguay, the Bishop met two vesselssent from Asuncion to do him honour.  When night approached he put in practiceone of the manoeuvres which in Peru had stood him in good stead.On every side a swarm of launches and canoes accompanied the shipto see the Bishop, whom already many believed a saint.  He asked them allto retire a little from his ship.  All did so but the guard of honoursent from Asuncion.  Towards the middle of the night the sound of scourgingwakened them.  It was their Bishop trying to prepare himself for the dutiesthat awaited him.  Every succeeding night the same thing happened.During the day he celebrated Mass pontifically upon the deck.  Voyages uponthe river Paraguay before the days of steamers took a considerable time,especially as every night the custom was to anchor or to make fast the vesselto a tree.  Soon the rumour reached Asuncion that a second St. Thomaswas on his way to visit them.  St. Thomas, as is said, once visited Paraguay,and a cave in the vicinity of a town called Paraguari, where he once lived,exists to-day to prove the passage of the saint.Fate seemed determined that the Bishop should always meet the Jesuits,no matter where he went.Becoming weary of the slow progress of the ships, he disembarkedfour leagues below Asuncion, at a farm belonging to the Company.He managed to dissemble his resentment so perfectly that no one knewhe had a grudge against them.  Arrived at the capital,he went at once to the church of San Blas, then to the Cathedral,where he celebrated Mass and preached, his mitre on his head.After service he dismissed the people to their homes to dine, saying, however,that he himself was nourished by an invisible food and by a beveragewhich men could not perceive.  `My food' (he said) `is but to dothe work and will of Him who sent me.'  Therefore he remainedin prayer and meditation until vespers, and that office finished,he retired to the palace accompanied by a shouting crowd.In his position his conduct was most adroit, for, as his Bullshad not arrived, he must have known he had no legal status, and that,in default of that, he had to conquer public sympathy.  The chapternever doubted that Don Bernardino would place himself entirely in their handsas his Bulls had not arrived.  He, however, seems to have thoughtthat the act of celebrating Mass pontifically in the Cathedralhad put him in possession of his powers.  So he named one Cristobal Sanchezas his Vicar-General.  Two of the members of the chapter,Don Diego Ponce de Leon and Don Fernando Sanchez, remonstrated,but a considerable portion of the chapter sided with Cardenas.The stronger party left the Cathedral and celebrated Massin the church belonging to the Jesuits, thus giving Cardenasa second cause of offence against the Company.The Bishop, not being secure of his position, had recourse to every art*to catch the public eye:  fasting and scourging, prayers before the altar,two Masses every day, barefoot processions -- himself the central figure,carrying a cross -- each had their turn.  Along the deep red roadsbetween the orange-gardens which lead from Asuncion towardsthe Recoleta and the Campo Grande, he used to take his wayaccompanied by Indians crowned with flowers, giving his benedictionas he passed, to turn away (according to himself) the plague and to insurea fertile harvest.  Not being content with the opportunitieswhich life afforded, he instituted an evening service in a churchin order to prepare for death.--* But besides putting into execution all his histrionic talents, he had  the adroitness to address himself to those feelings of self-interest which  he knew were perhaps more powerful than those of admiration and respect  for his own saintly proceedings in his new diocese.  Cretineau Joly,  in his `Histoire de la Compagnie de Jesus', vol. iii., p. 333  (Paris, 1845), tells us that Cardenas `parle aux Espagnols,  il s'addresse a\ leurs intere^ts, il re/veille les vieux levain  de discorde . . . et il accuse les missionnaires d'e^tre seuls  les apo^tres de la liberte/ des Indiens.'--Soon, as was to be expected in such a country, this service provedthe occasion of much scandal, and, instead of showing peoplehow to leave the world, became the means of introducing many into lifein a clandestine way.  The rector of the Jesuit college thought it his dutyto inform the Bishop; but he, like all good men, thought nothing badcould spring from anything that he himself originated.  No doubthe put it down to malice, as good people will when worldlings put the fingeron the weak spot of a religious institution; but anyhow,regardless of the scandals, he continued his nocturnal rites.The Governor of Paraguay at that time was one Gregorio de Hinostrosa,an officer born in Chile, an honest, pious, wooden-headed man,and much beloved by the inhabitants of Paraguay.  On his arrivalDon Bernardino tried to conciliate him.  Unluckily, a friendshipwith the Bishop was impossible without a blind submission to his will.In the beginning all was flattery; when Don Gregorio attended Mass,the Bishop used to meet him at the church door.  Not to be outdone,the Governor returned the Bishop's politeness in a similar way,but went so far in his complaisance that Don Bernardinoceased to respect him.  Soon there arose bickerings and jealousies,and at length they hated one another fervently.Nor was the Bishop more successful with his clergy.  Some of them laughedat his pretensions to be a saint, and called him an ambitious schemer.Again, amongst the laity, many did not quite understandhis habit of celebrating two Masses every day.  He answeredthat he never celebrated without releasing a soul from purgatory,and that there had been saints who celebrated nine Masses every day,and, moreover, that he was Pope in his own diocese.  This cut the ground fromunder the feet of his detractors, for in a town of the calibre of Asuncionthe people looked on a service in a church as a welcome means of gettingthrough the day, and had he celebrated a dozen masses they would but have beenmore delighted with their new Bishop.Under the pretext that there were not enough priests to serve the churches,he, by degrees, took several parishes into his own hands,and went from church to church to celebrate his Mass in each,whilst not forgetting to draw the various stipends for his work.But, not content with this, he began to ordain young men who knew no Latin,and even criminals, setting forth the view that ordinationwas a sort of second baptism, which purged all crimes --a most convenient theory, and one which is not half enough insisted onin these degenerate days.The position of Asuncion gave him an opportunity of an almost unique kindto show his talents in another sphere.  Across the river Paraguay,there about one mile broad, extends the country called the Chaco,a vast domain of swamp and forest, inhabited in those days, as at present,by tribes of wandering Indians.  From the city walls, whilst listening tothe church-bells, one can see the smoke of Indian encampments across the riveronly a mile away.Of all the Indian tribes in the time of Cardenas, the most ferociouswere the Guaycurus.  The Jesuits had laboured almost in vain amongst them.Missions had been founded, and all gone well for months, and even years,when on a sudden, and without reason, the Guaycurus had burned the houses,killed the priests, and gone back to the wilds.  From Santa Feup to the province of Matto Grosso they kept the frontier in a turmoil,crossing the river and feeding like locusts on the settlements in Paraguay.Not long before his arrival the Guaycurus had intimatedtheir intention of holding a conference with Don Gregorio Hinostrosa.Don Bernardino thought the chance too good to lose, and at once declared that,as a Bishop, it was his place to carry on negotiations with the barbarians.Dressed in his robes and with an escort furnished by the Governor, he metthe chiefs -- who no doubt looked on him as a new kind of medicine-man --preached to them through an interpreter, curiously being withoutthe gift of tongues, but notwithstanding that a reasonable number of themwere baptized.  On his return, he wrote to the King that by his effortshe had appeased the most ferocious Indians within his Majesty's domains.Within a week the Guaycurus surprised and burned a settlementa little higher up the stream.  Not content with this Caligulesque apostolateto the Guaycurus, the Bishop longed for serious occupation,and caused it to be rumoured about the city that he did nothingexcept by the direct authority of the Holy Ghost, an allegationhard to confute, and if allowed, likely to lead to difficultieseven in Paraguay.Some years before the advent of Don Bernardino the Dominicans had builta convent in Asuncion.  As they had no license to build,they were in the position of religious squatters on the domain of God.The citizens had applied to the Audiencia of Charcas, the supreme court onall such matters in South America, situated, with true Spanish unpracticality,in one of the most secluded districts of the continent.  The Audienciahad refused the license, but had taken the matter `ad advisandum'for ten years.  To take a matter into consideration for ten years,even in Spain or South America, where the law's delay is generally more mortalthan in any other country, was as good as giving a permission.So the Dominicans construed it, and no one dreamed of now molesting them.One day the Bishop, dressed in his robes, proceeded from his palaceto the convent, informing the Governor that he wanted him to meet him there.Entering the convent church, he took the sacrament from off the altarand stripped the church of all its ornaments, setting a gang of workmento demolish both the convent and the church.  When the work was over,he went to a neighbouring church, and then and there, without confession,celebrated Mass, remarking to the faithful that there was no need for himto make confession, as he was satisfied of the condition of his conscience.Some murmured; but the greater portion of the people, always readyto take a saint at his own valuation, were delighted with his act.Doubts must have crossed his mind, as shortly afterwards he wroteto Don Melchior Maldonado, Bishop of Tucuman, for his opinion.That Bishop answered rather tartly that his zeal appeared to himto savour more of the zeal of Elias than of Jesus Christ,and that in a country where churches were so few it seemed imprudentto pull down rather than to build.  `However,' he added,`my light is not so brilliant as the light your lordship is illumined by.'When once a man is well convinced that all he does comes from the Holy Ghost,there is but little that he cannot do with satisfaction to himself.Self-murderers, according to the custom of those times,were not allowed admission into holy ground, as if the factof having found their life unbearable debarred them from the rightto be considered men.  Such a man a few years previously had been buriedat a cross-road.  It now occurred to Cardenas to have a special revelationon the subject; and, curiously enough, this special revelationwas on the side of common-sense.  `This body,' said the Bishop,`is that of a Christian, and I feel pretty sure his soul is now in bliss.'He gave no reason for his opinion, as is the way of most religious folk,but, as he had special means of communication with heaven,most people were contented.  Incontinently he had the corpse dug upand buried in the church of the Incarnation, himself performingall the funeral rites.Although a miracle or two would have shocked nobody,still, in the matter of the suicide he had gone too farfor the simple people of the place.  They murmured, and for a momentthe Bishop's prestige was in jeopardy; but in the nick of timehis Bulls arrived, brought by his nephew, Pedro de Cardenas,who, like himself, was a Franciscan friar.  This saved him,and gave the people something new to think of, though at the same timehe incurred a new anxiety.In the Bulls there was a passage to the effect that, if at his consecrationany irregularity had been incurred, he was liable to suspensionfrom all his functions.  This the Jesuit who translated the documentsinto Spanish for the purpose of publication drew his attention to.However, Cardenas was not a man to be intimidated by so small a matter,but read the translation to the people in the Cathedral,and intimated to them that the Pope had given him unlimited power in Paraguay,both in matters spiritual and temporal.Though Don Gregorio, the Governor, was present at the ceremony,he made no protest at the assumption of temporal power by Cardenas.He had remarked it, though, and secretly determined to show himthat his pretensions were unfounded.  His nephew, Don Pedro de Cardenas,furnished the occasion.  This young man had been despatched to Spainto get the Bulls.  Upon the voyage he seems to have conducted himselfwith scant propriety.  On his return, when passing Corrientes,he took on board a lady whom Charlevoix, quite in the spirit of the authorof the Book of Proverbs, describes as `une jeune femme bien faite'.Having some qualms of conscience, he put on a secular dress,and on nearing Asuncion put his religious habit over it.In such a climate this double costume must have been inconvenient,and why he should have worn one dress above the other does not appear.His uncle, in his delight at the forthcoming of the Bulls,most probably paid little attention to his appearance.He lodged him in the palace, and assigned him a prebendary which was vacant.Where the `jeune femme bien faite' was lodged is not set down,and the people of Asuncion no doubt looked leniently on such affairs,as does society to-day in England.  After his usual fashion,the Bishop set all down to calumny.About this time the Governor had put in prison one Ambrosio Morales,a sub-official of the Inquisition, who had had a quarrel with an officer.Cardenas, being informed of this, could not lose so good a chanceof exercising the power he arrogated in temporal affairs.Holding a monstrance in his hands, he went to the prison and askedfor the prisoner, placing the monstrance on a table at the prison gate.The rector of the Jesuit college came and expostulated with him,saying that it was not fitting to expose the body of Jesus Christin such a place, and that it was not decent that the Bishop himselfshould stay there.  Considering his position, and the times in which he lived,it seems the rector was judicious in his expostulation.  Cardenas repliedthat he would stay there till the prisoner was released.  The rector,knowing him to be as obstinate as a male mule, went and begged the Governorto let Morales out.  This he did at once, and then the Bishop, cross in hand,returned in triumph to the palace with the rescued Inquisitorfollowing amongst his train.  The people, whose lives were dull,snatched at the opportunity for some amusement, and said that it was good luckthe Governor and Bishop were not always of one mind, for that their agreementhad caused the demolition of a church and convent, and their quarrelthe setting of a prisoner free.This little triumph emboldened the Bishop to go further.  He admitted Moralesinto minor orders, gave him the tonsure, and thus, having placed himabove the temporal power, enabled him to brave the Governor openly.The Bishop's nephew, taking the Governor's kindness for weakness,broke publicly into insulting terms about him.  The Governor's brother,Father Hinostrosa, pressed him to vindicate his dignity,but he refused, saying he wanted peace at any price.  This policythe Bishop did not understand, for all concessions he set down as weakness,and they encouraged him to fresh exactions and more violence.Dining with the Governor, the Bishop chanced to see upon the tablea fine pair of silver candlesticks.  To see and to desirewith Cardenas was to ask, and so he intimated to the Governorhis wish to have them.  The Governor, thinking, perhaps,to wipe out the remembrance of the difficulty about Morales,sent them to the palace with his compliments.  The Bishop took the present,and, turning to the man who brought them, said, `I should now be quite contentif I only had the silver ewer and flagon which I noticedin your master's house.'  The Governor, we may suppose,on hearing this made what the Spaniards call `la risa del conejo';but sent the plate and a message, saying all his house contained was atthe Bishop's service.  Don Bernardino, who, though he may have been a saint,as his friends proclaimed, was certainly far from a gentleman,sent for the flagon and the ewer, which he received at once,together with a friendly message from the Governor.But even this free-will offering brought no quiet, for a new quarrelsoon arose between the Bishop and the unlucky wielder of the temporal power.The Society of the Holy Sacrament enjoyed an `encomienda'at or near Asuncion.  The Bishop, no doubt thinking he was most fittedto indoctrinate the Indians, endeavoured to persuade the Governor to getthe Society of the Holy Sacrament to make their Indians over to himself.The Governor, who knew his fellow-countrymen, flatly refused,and upon this Don Bernardino fell into a fury, and reproached him withsuch bitterness that Don Gregorio, too, overstepped the bounds of prudence,and threw the conduct of his nephew with the `jeune femme bien faite'into the Bishop's teeth.Hell has been said to have no fury equal to a woman scorned,but a Bishop thwarted makes a very tolerable show.  Don Bernardinowas one of those who think an insult to themselves carries with ita challenge to God, an outrage on religion, and generally conceivethe honour of Heaven is attacked by any contradiction of themselves.To animadvert upon the actions of a Bishop's nephew is as bad as heresy-- far worse than simony -- and the man who does it cannot but bea heretic at heart.  So, at least, Don Bernardino thought;for, with candle, bell, and book, and what was requisite,he excommunicated the poor Governor, and declared him incompetentto bear the royal standard in a religious festival which was shortlyto take place.  Excommunication was at least as serious thenas bankruptcy is now, though in Spanish America it did not carry with itsuch direful consequences as in European States.Not wishing to use force, the Governor yielded the point,and did not trouble the procession.  His moderate conductgained him many partisans, and put many people against the Cardenas.The nephew, Pedro de Cardenas, thought it a good occasionto insult the Governor in public; so one day in the street he followed him,casting reflections on his mother and his female relatives.Don Gregorio, who was a man of tried courage, having served for yearsagainst the Indians of Arauco, the bravest race of all the Indians of America,controlled his temper, and, turning to the young Franciscan,said, `Go with God, my father; but do not try me any more.'It was not to be expected that in those times and such a placea man like Don Gregorio de Hinostrosa, who had passed his lifeupon the frontiers, and who held supreme authority, would quietly submitto such a public insult; so one night he appeared at the Bishop's palace,accompanied by soldiers, to arrest Don Pedro.  Out came Cardenas,and excommunicated the Governor and all his soldiers on the spot,and Don Pedro pointed a pistol at his head.  He, seeing himself obligedeither to make a public scandal or retire, being for peace at any price,retired, and the triumphant Bishop published his edict of excommunication,which he extended with a fine of fifty crowns to every soldierwho had been present at the scene.  On reflection, thinking, perhaps,it was unwise to excommunicate so many soldiers, who might be neededto repel an Indian attack, he sent and told the Governorhe was ready to absolve him upon easy terms.  The Governor,who had made light of the first excommunication, was rather staggeredwhen he found the second posted at the Cathedral door.And now a comedy ensued; for Don Gregorio went to the Bishop,and on his knees asked for forgiveness.  He, taken unawares,also knelt down, and, when the Governor kissed his hand,wished to return the compliment, and would have done sohad the rector of the Jesuit college not prevented him.As Charlevoix says, `to see them on their knees, no one could have imaginedwhich one it was who asked the other's grace.'  The Bishop granted absolutionto the Governor; but the soldiers' action had been flat sacrilege at least,for every one of them was forced to pay the fine.Two excommunications in a week were almost, one would think,enough to satisfy a Pope; but having nominated one Diego Hernandez,a Portuguese, to the post of Alguacil Mayor of the Inquisition,and given him the right to wear a sword in virtue of his office,the Governor, meeting the man in the street wearing a swordagainst his regulations, made him a prisoner.  At once Don Bernardinolaunched another excommunication.  But this time he had gone too far;the Governor laughed at his thunder, and condemned the prisoner to be hanged.At his wits' end, the Bishop sent a servant to the man,and told him to fear nothing, for that, if he suffered death,he was a martyr, and that he himself would preach his funeral sermon.The Governor, who was perhaps a humorist, laughed at the message, which,he said, was not consoling, and then himself let Hernandez out of prisonunder heavy bail.  The excommunication was then taken off,and peace once more reigned in Asuncion.As well as being not given to wine, it is essential that a Bishopshall know how to keep his own counsel -- as Lorenzo Gracian expresses it,*`not to lie, but not for that to speak out always the whole truth.'Everyone who knew the Bishop and his hasty temper was astonished athis behaviour to the Jesuits.  No one imagined he had forgotten the attitudethe rector of the University of Cordova had assumed towards his consecration,and still the Bishop seemed to show more favour to the Jesuits in Asuncionthan to the members of the other religious communities.Perhaps he felt the want of partisans amongst the educated classes,for his quarrel with the Governor had lost him many friends.Certainly in Asuncion it was of great importance that the Jesuitsshould not declare against him openly.--* `Oraculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia' (Amsterdam, en casa  de Juan Blau, 1659).--He praised them fulsomely both in the pulpit and in conversation,went in procession to their church, and treated them in publicwith marked consideration.  As a contemporaneous Jesuit has left a record,they were not his dupes, but still endeavoured to live up to the praiseshe dispensed to them.  He went so far as in a letter to the King, Philip IV.,to say that the Jesuits only in all Paraguay were really fittedto have the care of Indians, and he advised the King to transferthe Indians who were under other religious bodies, as well as thoseunder the secular clergy, to the care and guidance of that Order.No doubt in this the Bishop was right, even if not sincere.One of the qualifications the Jesuits had for the care of Indianswas that the Indians did not look on them as Spaniards.As in the same way that in Matabeleland, perhaps, a German, Frenchman,or Italian is less hateful to the natives than an Englishman,so in Paraguay the Indians liked the Jesuits better than the other Orders,for there were many foreigners amongst their ranks.  The Jesuitssoon comprehended that the Bishop wished to make them odious to the publicby overpraise.  To set to work in such a manner almost requiresan early training in a seminary, and that such tactics should have beenput in force against such skilled diplomatists as were the Jesuitsargues no ordinary capacity for diplomatic work in Cardenas.With him, however, the Spanish proverb, `Betwixt the word and deedthe space is great', had little application.  The vicar of a placecalled Arecaya, close to Asuncion, had fallen into disgrace; the Bishopremoved him from his parish, and asked the rector of the Jesuit collegeto send a priest to take his place.  The answer he received was politic,and to the effect that there was no Jesuit who could be spared,and even if there was it ill-befitted any Jesuit to infringe uponthe duties of the secular clergy; but that, if Cardenas intended to founda new reduction with all the privileges that the King had always givento that kind of establishment, the rector himself would ask permissionfrom his Provincial to undertake the work.  A splendid answer,and one which proved that the man who gave it was a man wasted in Paraguay,and that his place by rights was Rome or, at the least, some court.Don Bernardino, who in matters such as these was quite as cunningas the rector, thanked him, and said he did not want a saint,but a priest to take the duty of another priest for a short time.The rector, seeing his diplomacy had failed, told Father Mansilla,who was at Itatines, to transfer himself to Arecaya,and, writing to the Bishop, told him that he had no doubtMansilla would do all that was fitting in the case.  The Bishop,who had gained his point and saw no further use for diplomacy, said:`Of that I am quite sure, and if he does not I shall excommunicate him,and lay the district of the Itatines under an interdict.'Nothing appeared to give Don Bernardino such unmitigated pleasureas an excommunication; on the slightest protest he was ready,so that during his episcopate someone or other in Asuncionmust have always been under the ban of Holy Mother Church.The rector felt instinctively that Don Bernardino had not done with him.This was the case, for soon another order came to send two Jesuitsto undertake the guidance of a mission near Villa Rica.As at the time the Jesuits had no missions near Villa Rica,the order was most unpleasant to him.  Firstly, the two who went-- Fathers Gomez and Domenecchi -- had to leave their missions and undertakea lengthy journey in the wilds.  On reaching Villa Rica,they found not only that the inhabitants looked on them with great disfavouras interlopers, but that the Indians, whom they were sent to guide,were under the `encomienda' system, thus forcing them to wink at thatwhich they disapproved.  The resolution that they took did them great honour;it was to leave the town of Villa Rica and live out in the forestswith the Indians.The Jesuits of the college at Asuncion felt the situation keenly.People began to murmur at them for their invasion of the spiritual domainsof others, and the rector, in despair, sent to the Bishop, and begged himnot to praise them in his sermons.  Nothing cost Cardenas so littleas to promise, so he promised not to mention them again,and next time that he preached he spent an hour in telling of the wondersthat the Jesuits had done in saving souls, not only amongst Catholics,but also amongst the infidels and Turks.  The tactics of the Bishopwere so marked that at last a rumour reached Don Melchior Maldonado,the Bishop of Tucuman, of whom Don Bernardino always stood in dread.His letter somehow became public, and as in it he spokemost warmly of the Jesuits, and praised the rector, the public turned againupon their side.  Just at this time, however, the sleeping feudbetween the Bishop and the Governor broke out anew with so much furythat attention was directed from the Jesuits for the time being;but on them the situation still was hung, and both sides made advances to themfor support.Chapter V  Renewal of the feud between the Bishop and Don Gregorio --  Wholesale excommunications in Asuncion -- Cardenas in 1644  formulates his celebrated charges against the Jesuits --  The Governor, after long negotiations and much display of force,  ultimately succeeds in driving out the Bishop -- For three years  Cardenas is in desperate straits -- In 1648 Don Gregorio  is suddenly dismissed, Cardenas elects himself Governor,  and for a short time becomes supreme in Asuncion -- The Jesuits  are forced to leave the town and to flee to Corrientes -- A new Governor  is appointed in Asuncion -- He defeats Cardenas on the field of battle --  The latter is deprived of his power, and dies soon after as Bishop of La PazThe Governor, like a prudent soldier, was biding his time.  The Bishop,not yet strong enough to walk alone, dared not break openly with the Jesuits.Don Pedro Cardenas still following up his evil courses,poor Don Gregorio Hinostrosa, accustomed all his lifeto deal with `officers and gentlemen', thought fit to bring thisunder his uncle's notice.  The Bishop spoke to his nephewin a paternal fashion, enjoining certain penances upon him,and amongst others that he was to kiss the earth.  Although Don Pedro Cardenaswas not a man accustomed to lavish kisses on things inanimate, he complied,but, though complying, still pursued his vicious course.Quite in the manner of King Charles (of pious memory), the Governor determinedto arrest the recalcitrant with his own hand.  Armed to the teeth,and with a band of musketeers accompanying him, he appearedbefore the convent of St. Francis, where Father Cardenas had taken refuge,and, dragging him from his bed, haled him incontinently to the river's bank,and left him gagged and bound, a prey to flies and sun, for two whole days,dressed in his drawers and shirt.  On the third day he was embarkedin a canoe for Corrientes, with a small quantity of jerked beeffor all provision, and a woman's cloak wrapped round his shouldersto shield him from the cold.  Not quite the guise in which a clergymanwould care to appear before the eyes of his superiors, even in Paraguay.Naturally, the Bishop, having nothing else to do, got out his excommunicationin his usual style, but no man marked him.Meantime Asuncion was in confusion, the Bishop and the Governorkeeping no measure with the other man of sin.  One tried to obtainpossession of the other's person to throw him into prison;the other strove to animate the preachers in the various churchesto consign his rival's soul to hell.  In the deserted streets drums thundered,whilst in the air bells jangled, and the quiet, sleepy town was rent in twainby the dissensions of the opposing powers.  The churches closed their doors,and the consolations of religion were withdrawn from those who wanted them.To add to the confusion, Don Pedro Cardenas escaped from Corrientes, and,having taken to himself a companion -- one Francisco Sanchez de Carreras --raged through the city like a devil unchained.  In his extremity,the poor Bishop went to the Jesuits for advice, informing themhe could not stand the scandals that were taking place, and that he intendedto leave the city after launching an interdict of excommunication upon all.Placed in the position of declaring openly either for Bishop or for Governor,the Jesuits refused an answer, knowing that anything they saidwould be brought up against them.  All their advice to him was,`to trust in God, to persevere in his good efforts, to resign himselfto divine will, which will, as the Bishop knew full well,worked sometimes in a mysterious fashion for the welfare of the soul.'The Bishop answered this advice `fort sechement',* taking itfor a reproach, and as a sort of thing not to be toleratedamongst professionals -- as if one lawyer, having gone to anotherfor his advice upon a private matter, had received for answera lecture on conveyancing or a short treatise upon Roman Law.--* Charlevoix.--Still, the occasion called for something to be done;so, calling an Indian servant, he stripped to the waist,and, to the horror and amazement of the public, appeared withnaked feet and shoulders, dressed in a sack and armed with a heavy scourge.At the first blow he gave himself some canons of the Cathedral begged himto desist; but he, after prayer, replied that he intended, so to speak,to act as his own Pascal lamb, and wipe out the affront done to St. Francisin his unworthy blood.A naked Bishop in a sack is almost sure to attract some observationeven in Paraguay.  Religious women not unfrequently have been attractedby such a spectacle, and so it proved on this occasion.Although the Jesuits and the saner portion of the populationblamed the Bishop's action, he made himself a host of partisansamongst the women of all classes, who followed him as they have often followedother thaumaturgists in times present and gone by.His friend Don Melchior Maldonado, hearing what had passed,wrote to reprove him for his inconsiderate zeal.  In his epistlehe observed that, though some of the Apostles had scourged themselves,it was not their habit to appear half naked before a crowd of women;that our Lord Himself had not of His own accord taken off His garmentsfor the scourger; that saints who scourged themselves had, as a general rule,chosen a private place for their self-discipline.  This was quite reasonable,but the advice was little to the taste of the recipient, who hated criticismwhen levelled at himself.If crosses make a saint, about this time Don Bernardino hadhis full share of them.  News came from Itatines, where the two Jesuits hadbeen marooned, that both of them were ill.  Cardenas, who, we may remember,was `homme a visions', called in the rector of the Jesuit collegeto inform him that the Company of Jesus had a new martyr in their ranks.Though martyrs (even to-day) enter the ranks of General Loyola's armypretty frequently, it still seemed strange that the Bishopshould know of this particular recruit before the rector.Pressed for an explanation, he replied that a pious person who was vouchsafedcommunication with the Lord in prayer had seen Father Domenecchi in heavenshining in glory and with a halo round his head.Nothing could be more satisfactory.  All the essentialsof a well-attested miracle had been complied with.  A man was dead,another man had seen the dead man in an ecstasy of prayer,and, to make all complete, refused to testify himself, sending the Bishopas a sort of pious phonograph.  No true believer in such a case could doubt,and all went well till it appeared a man from Itatines, charged with a messageto the Jesuit college, had passed the night before he gave his messageat the Bishop's house.  In Holy Writ we read the wicked manshall have no rest; if this is so, it is as it should be,though generally the good seem just as troubled in their livesas the most erring of their brethren.  He who would be a saintmust be a-doing, year in, year out, just like a common workman,and Cardenas was no exception to the rule.The pseudo-miracle not having been quite a success, he turned to other fields,and summoned all the inhabitants of Paraguay to attend at the Cathedralupon a certain day.  The Governor, thinking there was a revolutionlikely to break out, fixed a review of all the troops for the same date.A Jesuit priest waited upon the Bishop to persuade him that the crowdswhich would assemble might break the peace.  The Bishop reassured him,and sent him to the Governor to say that his intentionwas to preach to the people and explain to them the faith; further,that he intended on that day to raise his excommunication and be reconciled:only he asked him to allow the troops to attend and hear his sermon.The crowd was great; the Bishop mounted the pulpit, and,extending his forefinger in the attitude of malediction so dear to Bishops,straight began to preach.  For a time all went well.  The Governor,presumably, was waiting for the circulation of the hat -- that awful mysterywhich makes all sects kin -- when to his horror Cardenas began to enumerateall his offences:  he was anathema, was excommunicated, a disbeliever,and had endeavoured to cast down that which the Lord Himself had set on high.The Bishop then informed the crowd that God was angry with the Governor,talked about Moses, and dwelt with unction on the fact that the great lawgiverhad been swift to slay.In a peroration which, no doubt, went home to all, he called upon his hearers,under penalty of a heavy fine and his displeasure, to seize the Governor,adding that if there was resistance `he should kill his brother, his friend,or his nearest relative.'*  After these words he seized a bannerfrom the hands of the astonished officer who stood nearest to him,and stood forth, like another Phineas, surrounded by his clergy,all of whom had arms beneath their cloaks.--* Exod. 32:27.--A most dramatic scene, and probably almost successful, had but the Bishoponly reckoned with two things:  Firstly, he had forgotten that the Governorwas an old Indian fighter, and ready for surprises; and, secondly,he had not taken into account the usual apathy of the common peoplewhen their leaders fight.  Dumbly and quite unmoved the people stood,staring like armadillos at a snake, and made no sign.  Then word was broughtthat the Governor had left the church and was assemblinga force of arquebusiers.Surrounded only by clergymen, Don Bernardino had to yield,and yielded like a Levite, with a subterfuge.  He sent a priestto beg the magistrates to come to the Cathedral and reason with him.After a consultation this was done, and Cardenas consentedto abate his fury and exhale his wrath.  He said that Holy Writ itselfgave leave to recur to force in self-defence (but did not quote the text),and that the Governor had meditated a like enterprise against himself;moreover, that, he being an excommunicated man, it became lawfulfor God's vicegerent to lay hold on him.After the scene was over, and the Bishop was escorted back to his palaceby the magistrates, a second letter came from Tucumanmaking plain his conduct to him after the manner of a friend.The rector of the Jesuits also thought fit to remonstrate,and say that Cardenas had gone too far in attempting to assumethe temporal power.  This sufficed to further strain the relationsbetween the Bishop and the Jesuits.As, even in Asuncion in 1643, it was unusual that the Governor should remainfor ever under the ban of Holy Mother Church, arbiters were chosento discuss the matter, and provide means whereby the Bishop couldconveniently climb down.  The arbiters absolved the Governor on the conditionthat he paid a fine of four thousand arrobas* of `yerba mate',which in money amounted to eight thousand crowns.  Quite naturally,the Bishop refused to abide by the decision, replaced his adversaryunder the ban, and recommenced to preach against him with considerable force.--* The arroba is about twenty-five pounds weight.--The higgling of the market not having proved effectualin the adjustment of the sum to be paid by the Governor, a priest,one Juan Lozano, who had been condemned to imprisonment by his superiorsfor his loose life, and who had taken refuge with the Bishop,hit on a stroke of veritable genius.  At a conference which took placebetween the Bishop and several notables of the place,including the rector of the Jesuits, Lozano gave it as his opinion that,if the Governor refused to pay, a general interdict should be proclaimed.The rector of the Jesuits retired indignantly, and `Pe\re Lozano,retroussant sa robe le poursuivit en criant a\ pleine te^te,et s'exprimant en des termes peu seans a\ sa profession.'*By this time Asuncion must have been like a madhouse, for no one seemsto have been astonished, or even to have thought his conduct singular.The Bishop, always ready to take the worst advice, got ready for his task,and on Easter Eve embarked upon the river, leaving his Vicar-Generalunder orders to proclaim the general ban.  This was done,and the edict so contrived as to catch the luckless Governorin every church.  The practical effect was to close all the churches,for to whatever church the Governor went the priest refusedto celebrate the Mass.  Several other persons were mentioned in the ban,which was posted up below a crucifix in the choir of the Cathedral.As Don Bernardino had omitted to state the particular offencesfor which they were condemned, the general confusion became intense,and no one attended Mass, so that the churches were deserted.After a little some of the churches opened in a clandestine manner,others remained closed, and the followers of the Bishop and the Governoralternately assembled in a rabble, and threw stones at all the churches,dispensing their favours quite impartially.  The various religious Orders,not to be behindhand, also took sides, the Jesuits giving as their opinionthat the Governor, not having a war upon his back, was really excommunicated;the Dominicans holding that the Bishop, in the general interest,ought to absolve him.  He, armed with the opinion of the latter Order,marched to the dwelling of the Bishop's Vicar-General,and, having nailed up both doors and windows, sent a trumpeterto tell him he should not leave his house till absolution had been granted.Still nothing came of it, and then the Governor did what he should have doneat first:  he sent a statement of the whole proceedingsto the high court at Charcas.  This high court (Audiencia) was situatedright in the middle of what is now Bolivia, miles away from Lima,half a world from Paraguay, at least two thousand miles from Buenos Ayres,and separated from Chile by the whole Cordillera of the Andes.Even to-day the journey from Paraguay often exceeds a month.--* Charlevoix.--The Bishop, not to be outdone, also prepared a statement,in which he accused his adversary of all the crimes that he could think of,and confirmed his statement with an oath.  The chapter,thinking things were in an impossible condition, besought thatthe fine laid on the excommunicated folk should be raised or lessened,as it appeared to them there was not money in the town to satisfy it.Cardenas refused, and thus four months elapsed.  Soon after thisarrived one Father Truxillo, of the Order of St. Francis,who came from Tucuman as Vice-Provincial.  Cardenas, thinking,as they were both Franciscans, that Truxillo must needs be favourableto his cause, made him his Vicar-General, with power to bind and to unloose --that is, to free the excommunicated folk from all their disabilities if,on examination, it seemed good to him.  Truxillo, who was quite unbiassedas to matters in Asuncion, looked into everything, and declaredthe Governor and everybody ought to be absolved.  He further gave itas his opinion that, the affair having gone to the high court at Charcas,he could do nothing but give an interim decree.  Don Bernardino heard the newsat Itati, an Indian village a few miles outside Asuncion.  From thencehe went to a somewhat larger village called Yaguaron, and shut himself upin a convent, after declaring everyone (except the superior clergy)under the severest censure of the Church if they should dare approach.Not a bad place for prayer and meditation is Yaguaron.  A score or twoof little houses, built of straw and wood and thatched with palm-leaves,straggle on the hillside above the shores of a great camalote-covered* lake.Parrots scream noisily amongst the trees, and red macaws hover like hawksover the little patches of maize and mandioca planted amongst the palms.Round every house is set a grove of orange-trees, mingled with lemons,sweet limes, and guayabas.  Inside the houses all is so cleanthat you could eat from any floor with less repulsion than from the platesat a first-class hotel.  A place where life slips on as listless and luxuriantas the growth of a banana, and where at evening time,when the women of the place go to fetch water in a long linewith earthen jars balanced upon their heads, the golden ageseems less improbable even than in Theocritus.  To Yaguaronthe higher clergy flocked to intercede for the good people of Asuncion,all except Father Truxillo, who, knowing something of his Bishop,did not go.  That he was wise, events proved shortly.  Two canons-- Diego Ponce de Leon and Fernando Sanchez -- he imprisoned in their rooms,calling them traitors to their Bishop and their Church.Deputations came from the capital to beg for their release,but all in vain.  The Bishop answered them that he had set his mindto purge his diocese of traitors; and the two canons remained in prison.After a detention which lasted forty days, they escaped and fledto Corrientes, which must have looked upon Asuncion as a vast madhouse.Truxillo, who seems to have been a man not quite so absolutely devoid of senseas the other clergy, endeavoured to organize a religious `coup d'etat';but, most unfortunately, a letter he had written to some of the saner clergyfell into the Bishop's hands.  Excommunications now positively rainedupon the land.  The Governor, the Jesuits, the Dominicans,each had their turn; but, curiously enough, the poorer peoplestill stood firm to Cardenas, thinking, no doubt, a man who treatedall the richer sort so harshly must do something for the poor.Nothing, however, was further from the thoughts of Cardenas,who thought the whole world circled round himself.  The Bishop's nephewhaving returned to Corrientes and his former naughty life, Don Bernardino,casting about for another secretary, came on one Francisco Nieto,an apostate from the Order of St. Francis, and living openlywith an Indian woman, by whom he had a son.  Him the Bishop made his chaplain,then his confessor; and poor Nieto found himself obliged to sendhis Indian wife away in spite of all his protests and his wish to liveobscurely as he had been living before his elevation to the post of secretary.A veritable beachcomber Father Francisco Nieto seems to have been,and the type of many a European in Paraguay, who asks no betterthan to forget the tedium of our modern life and pass his daysin a little palm-thatched hut lost in a clearing of a wood or near some lake.--* Camalote is a species of water-lily which forms a thick covering  on stagnant rivers and lakes in Paraguay and in the Argentine Republic.--So in Asuncion things went from bad to worse.  Such trade as then existedwas at a standstill, and bands of starving people swarmed in the streets,whilst the incursions of the savage Indians daily became more frequent.In fact, Asuncion was but a type of what the world would beunder the domination of any of the sects without the counterpoiseof any civil power.  The Governor, seeing the misery on every side,determined, like an honest man, to pocket up his pride and reconcile himselfwith Cardenas at any price.  So, setting forth with all his staff,he came to Yaguaron.  There, like a penitent, he had to beara reprimand before the assembled village and engage to pay a finebefore the rancorous churchman would relieve him from the ban.The weakness of the Governor had the effect that might havebeen expected, and heavy fines were laid on all and sundrywho had in any manner displeased the Bishop or leaned to the other sidein the course of the dispute.Right in the middle of the struggle between the clerical and lay authorities,a band of over three hundred Guaycurus appeared before the town.Unluckily, all the chief officers of the garrison were excommunicated,and thus incapable of doing anything to defend the place.Foolish as Cardenas most indubitably was, his folly did not carry him so faras to leave the capital of his diocese quite undefended.Still, he would not give way first, and only at the moment when the Indiansseemed prepared to attack the town, at the entreaty of a `pious virgin',he raised the excommunication on the Governor and his officersfor fifteen days.  The Governor, instead of, like a sensible man,seizing the Bishop and giving him to the `cacique' of the Guaycurus,led out his troops and drove the Indians off.  That very nighthe found himself once more under the censure of the Church, and the conflictwith his opponent more bitter than at first.  The Viceroy of Peru,the Marquis of Mancera, indignant at the weakness of the Governor,wrote sharply to him, reprimanding him and telling him at onceto assert himself and force the Bishop to confine himselfto matters spiritual.  On the Governor's attempt to reassert himself,the answer was a general interdict laying the entire capitalunder the Church's ban.  On this, he marched to Yaguaron with all his troops,resolved to take the Bishop prisoner; but he, seeing the troops approach,went out at once, fell on the Governor's neck, and straightway absolved him.After the absolution came a banquet, which must have beena little constrained, one might imagine, and even less amusingthan the regulation dinner-party of the London season,where one sits between two half-naked and perspiring womeneating half-raw meat and drinking fiery wines with the thermometerat eighty in the shade.  Thus disembarrassed from the Governor,Don Bernardino turned his attention to the Jesuits, and signified to themthat he intended to take the education of the young out of their hands.This was a mortal affront to the Jesuits, as they have always understoodthat men, just as the other animals, can only learn whilst young.Hard upon this new step, Cardenas issued an edict forbidding them to preachor hear confessions.  As for the Governor, the Bishop did not fear him,and the poorer people of Asuncion had always inclined to the Bishop's party,either through terror of the Church's ban or from their natural instinctthat the Bishop was against the Government.But Cardenas saw clearly that, to deal as he wished with the Jesuits,he must entirely gain the Governor's confidence.  This he tried to doby sending to him one Father Lopez, Provincial of the Dominicans.This Lopez was an able and apparently quite honest man,for he told the Governor that the wish of Cardenas was to expel the Jesuitsfrom Paraguay, and from their missions, warning him at the same timenot to allow himself to be made use of by the Bishop in his design.From that moment the two adversaries seemed to have changed characters,and Don Gregorio became as cautious as a churchman, whereas the Bishopseemed to lose all his diplomacy.To all the protestations of friendship which were addressed to him,the Governor answered so adroitly that the Bishop fellinto the trap, and thought he had secured a partner to help himin the expulsion of the Jesuits.  Finally, at Yaguaron, during a sermon,he formulated his celebrated charges against the Jesuits, which,set on foot by him in 1644, eventually caused the expulsion of the whole Orderfrom America, and, though refuted a thousand times, still lingerin the writing of all those who treat the question down to the present day.The charges were seven in number, and so ingeniously contrivedthat royal, national, and domestic indignation were all aroused by them.The first was that the Jesuits prevented the Indians from paying*1*their annual taxes to the crown.  Secondly, that the Jesuits kept backthe tithes from Bishops and Archbishops.*2*  Thirdly, he said the Jesuitshad rich mines in their possession, and that the product of these mineswas all sent out of the country to the general fund at Rome.This the Jesuits disproved on several occasions, but, as often happensin such cases, proof was of no avail against the folly of mankind,to whom it seemed incredible that the Jesuits shouldbury themselves in deserts to preach to savages, unless there wassome countervailing advantage to be gained.  Even the factthat at the expulsion of the Company of Jesus from America no treasure at allwas found at any of their colleges or missions did not dispel the convictionthat they owned rich mines.  The fourth charge was that the Jesuitswere not particular about the secrets of the confessional,and that they used the information thus acquired for their own selfish ends.Further, that Father Ruiz de Montoya had acquired from the King,under a misapprehension, a royal edict,*3* giving the territoryof the missions to the Jesuits, thus taking the fruits of their conquestfrom the Spanish colonists.  Fifthly, that the Jesuits entered Paraguaypossessed but of the clothes upon their backs, that they had made themselvesinto the sovereign rulers of a great territory, but that he was goingto expel them, as the Venetians had expelled them from Venetia.*4*Sixthly, that even the Portuguese of San Paulo de Piritinangahad expelled them.*5*  His last assertion was that he himself, together withthe Bishop of Tucuman and others, had secret orders from the Kingto expel the Jesuits from their dioceses, but that the other Bishopslacked the courage which he (Cardenas) was then about to show.He wound up all by saying that, once the Jesuits were gone,the King would once again enjoy his rights, the Church be once againrestored to freedom, and, lastly, that there would be plenty of Indiansfor the settlers to enslave.  Quite possibly enough, the public,ever generous to a fault with other people's goods, cared littlefor the rights of a King who lived ten thousand miles away;and as for the Church, it seems most probable they failed to seethe peril that she ran.  But when the Bishop spoke of enslaving the Indians,they saw the Jesuits must go, for from the conquest the Jesuits had stoodbetween the settlers and their prey.  All things considered,Don Bernardino made a remarkable discourse that Sunday morningin the palm-thatched village by the lake, for the echo of it still resoundsin the religious world against the Jesuits.--*1* This was untrue, as the Jesuit missions were not at that time (1644)    apportioned into parishes under the authority of the Jesuits,    and such tribute as then was customary was all collected    by government officials.*2* This was also untrue, as the tithes were never regulated in Paraguay    till 1649.*3* This accusation was quite untrue, for the edict referred to    was not obtained under misapprehension, but after a complete    exposition of all the facts.  Moreover, it was subsequently    renewed on several occasions by the Spanish Kings.*4* The Venetians did not expel the Jesuits, they left Venetia    of their own accord.*5* Fathers Montoya and Tano went respectively to Rome and to Madrid    to lay the sorrows of the Indians before the King and Pope.    Having obtained the edict from the King that Cardenas referred to,    and a brief from the Pope (Urban VIII.) forbidding slavery,    they had the hardihood to appear within the city of San Paulo    and affix both edicts to the church door.  As was to be expected,    the Paulistas immediately expelled them from their territories,    and hence the semi-truth of the sixth charge made by Bishop Cardenas.--Like other men after a notable pronouncement, it is most probablethat Cardenas was unaware of the full import of his words.Perhaps he thought (as speakers will) that all the best portions of his sermonhad been left unsaid.  Be that as it may, he shortly turned his thoughtsto other matters of more direct importance to himself.In judging of his life, it should not be forgotten that,by his sermon at Yaguaron, he placed himself upon the side of thosewho wanted to enslave the Indians.  Perhaps he did not know this,and certainly his popularity amongst the Indians outside the missionswas enormous.  His next adventure was to try and eject the Jesuitsfrom a farm they had, called San Isidro.  The Governor having forbidden himto do so, he armed an army of his partisans to expel the Jesuitsfrom their college in the capital.Outside Asuncion the Lieutenant-Governor, Don Francisco Florez,met the Bishop's secretary, Father Nieto, who informed him of the enterprise,exhorting him to enlist the sympathies of the Governor in so good a cause.Florez, a better diplomatist than his commanding officer, seemed to approve,and naturally deceived poor Father Nieto, who, like most hypocrites,became an easy prey to his own tactics when used against himself.Florez informed the Governor at once, and he sent to the Jesuits,and put them on their guard.  Next day he met the Bishop, and told himthat his enterprise could not succeed, as the Jesuits were under arms.No doubt he learned these artifices in his campaigns againstthe Indians of Arauco, or it may have been that, like otherswho have had to strive with churchmen, he learned to beat themwith their own controversial arms.  The Bishop fell completely into the snare,and, thinking the Governor was a fast friend, confided all his plans to himfor the expulsion of the Jesuits and the conquest of the mission territory.Just then Captain Don Pedro Diaz del Valle came from La Plata,and gave Don Bernardino a new decision of the High Court of Charcas,telling him to live in peace with all men, and govern his diocese with zeal.He certainly was zealous to an extraordinary degree, if not judicious.Therefore, the very mention of the word `zeal' must have beenpeculiarly offensive to such a zealous man.  The letter went on to saythat all the fines he had exacted were illegal, and commanded himto give back the `yerba' which he had extorted from his involuntary penitents,and in the future live on better terms with all around him.  To all of thishe paid no notice, as was to be expected, but, to avoid returning the `yerba',sent a letter to his officers to have it burned.  This letter,which he denied, was subsequently produced against himin the High Court at Charcas.Seeing the Governor was bent on frustrating or on deceiving him,he tried to get from Don Sebastian Leon, who held an officeunder the Governor, an edict of the Emperor Charles V.,which he had heard was in the archives, and which provided that,in case a Governor should die or be deposed, the notables of the placehad power to appoint an interim Governor to fill his place.If such a paper ever existed, it must have been a very early documentgiven by Charles V. at the foundation of the colony, for nothingwas more opposed to the traditions of Spanish policy throughout America.Don Sebastian Leon having informed the Governor, the latter saw that thingswere coming to a crisis, and that either he or the Bishop would haveto leave the place.  Not being sure of all his troops, and the Bishop havingthe populace upon his side, he sent to the Jesuit missionsfor six hundred Indians.  Thus the supremacy of the royal governmentfell to be supported by men but just emerging from a semi-nomad life,who owed the tincture of civilization they possessedto the calumniated Jesuits.On many occasions armies of Indians from the Jesuit missionsrendered important services to the crown of Spain:  not only againstthe Portuguese, but against English corsairs, and in rebellions,as in the case of Cardenas; or as when, in the year 1680,Philip V. wrote to the Governor of Buenos Ayres to garrison the portwith a contingent of Indians from the Jesuit reductions; in 1681,when the French attacked the port with a squadron of four-and-twenty ships;and at the first siege of the Colonia, in 1678, when three thousand Indiansmarched to the attack, accompanied by their Jesuit pastors,but under the command of Spanish officers.*--* Funes, `Historia Civil del Paraguay, Buenos-Ayres, y Tucuman'.--An army from the Jesuit missions consisted almost entirely of cavalry.It marched much like a South American army of twenty years agowas wont to march.  In front was driven the `caballada',consisting of the spare horses; then came the vanguard,composed of the best mounted soldiers, under their `caciques'.Then followed the wives and women of the soldiers, driving the baggage-mules,and lastly some herdsmen drove a troop of cattle for the men to eat.When Jesuits accompanied the army, they did not enter into action,but were most intrepid in succouring the wounded under fire,as Funes, in his `Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,*relates when speaking of their conduct at the siege of the Colonia in 1703.For arms they carried lances, slings, `chuzos' (broad-pointed spears),lazos, and bolas, and had amongst them certain very long English gunswith rests to fire from, not very heavy, and of a good range.Each day the accompanying Jesuits said Mass, and each town carriedits particular banner before the troop.  They generally camped, if possible,in the open plain, both to avoid surprises and for convenience in guardingthe cattle and the `caballada'.  In all the territories of South Americano such quiet and well-behaved soldiery was to be found;for in Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Guatemala, the passage of an armywas similar to the passing of a swarm of locusts in its effect.--* The testimony of Funes is as follows:  `A/ juicio de testigo ocular  no es ma/s admirable la sangre fria de sus capellanes'  (`Historia Civil del Paraguay', book iii., cap. viii.).--Don Bernardino, on his side, was occupied in animating the populaceagainst the Jesuits with all the fervour of an Apostle.  Naturally,he first commenced by launching his usual sentence of excommunicationagainst them, and having done so returned again to Yaguaron.  This village,like other Paraguayan villages, many of which in times gone by have beenthe scenes of stirring episodes, retains to-day but little to distinguish it.Nature has proved too powerful in the long-run for men to fight against.On every side the woods seem ready to overwhelm the place.Grass grows between the wooden steps of the neglected church;seibos, lapachos, espinillos de olor, all bound together with lianas,encroach to the verges of the little clearings in which grows mandioca,looking like a field of sticks.  All day the parrots scream,and toucans and picaflores dart about; at evening the monkeys howl in chorus;at night the jaguar prowls about, and giant bats fasten uponthe incautious sleeper, or, fixing themselves upon a horse,leave him exhausted in the morning with the loss of blood.When Cardenas used the place as a sort of Avignon from whichto safely utter his anathemas, it must have worn a different aspect.No doubt processions and ceremonies were continual, with carrying aboutthe saints in public, a custom which the Paraguayans irreverently refer toas `sacando a/ luz los bultos'.*  Messengers (`chasquis'), no doubt,came and went perpetually, as is the custom in countries such as Paraguay,where news is valuable and horseflesh cheap.  Thereto flocked,to a moral certainty, all the broken soldiers who swarmed in countrieslike Peru and Paraguay, with Indian `caciques' looking out for work to dowhen white men quarrelled and throats were to be cut.  Priests went and came,friars and missionaries; and Cardenas most certainly, who loved effect,gave all his emerald ring to kiss, and made those promiseswhich leaders of revolt lavish on everyone in times of difficulty.--* Literally, `taking out the blocks to air'.  The effigies  are made of hard and heavy wood, and I remember once  in Concepcion de Paraguay assisting on a sweltering day  to carry a Madonna weighing about five hundredweight.--When the Indian contingent arrived, the Governor marched upon Yaguaron,although the air was positively lurid with excommunications.The Bishop, rushing to the church, was intercepted by the Governor,who seized his arm and tried to stop him.  Cardenas struggled with him,and declared him excommunicated for laying his hand uponthe anointed of the Lord.  But, most unfortunately, there wasno Fitz-Urse at hand to rid the Governor of so turbulent a priest.A mulatto* woman rushed to the Bishop's aid, together with some priests.This gave him time to gain the altar and seize the Host,which he exposed at once to the public gaze, and for the momentall present fell upon their knees.  Turning to the Governor,he asked what he wanted with armed men in a church.  The Governor repliedhe had come to banish him from Paraguay, by order of the Viceroy,for having infringed upon the temporal power.  Cardenas, taken aback,replied he would obey, and, turning to the people, took them allfor witnesses.  The Governor, no doubt thinking he was dealingwith an honest Araucan chief, retired.  The Bishop immediatelydenounced the Governor in a furious sermon, after which he left the church,carrying the Host in full procession, accompanied by the choirsinging the `Pange Lingua', followed by a band of Indian womenwith their hair dishevelled, and carrying green branches in their hands.He then returned to the church, and from the pulpit denounced the Governor,who, standing at the door surrounded by a group of arquebusiersblowing their matches, answered him furiously.--* The proverb says in Paraguay, `No se fia de mula ni mulata'.--The honours, so to speak, being thus equally divided, it remainedfor one side or the other to negotiate.  Cardenas, knowing himselfmuch abler in negotiations than his adversary, proposed a conference,in which he bore himself so skilfully that he made the Governor consentto dismiss his Indians, and allow him six days to make his preparationsfor the road.  This settled, at dead of night he set out for the capital.Arrived there, he showed himself in public in his green hat,having upon his breast a little box of glass in which he bore the Host.A band of priests escorted him, all with arms concealed beneath their cloaks,in the true spirit of the Church militant.  The bells were rung,and every effort strained to raise a tumult, but all in vain.He had to throw himself for refuge into the convent of the Franciscans.At once he set about to fortify the place to stand a siege.  In several placeshe constructed embrasures for guns, and pierced the walls for musketry.But, thinking that his best defence lay in the folly of the people-- as public men always have done, and do -- he sent to the Cathedralfor a statue of the Blessed Virgin, and another of San Blas,and placed them at the gate.  Then, remembering that calumnywas a most serviceable weapon, he put about the town a reportthat the Indians from the missions had pillaged Yaguaron,and that they even then were marching on the place.  Again recurringto the edict of Charles V., which he pretended to have found,he issued a proclamation that, as the present Governor was excommunicated,and therefore could not govern, the office being vacant, he intendedto nominate another in his stead.  His subsequent behaviour shows most clearlythat he wished to nominate himself.Again both sides sent off a relation of their doingsto the High Court of Charcas.  Don Bernardino wrote in his that the Jesuitshad offered the Governor thirty thousand crowns, and placed a thousand menat his command, if he would expel the Bishop from the country,under the belief that he (Don Bernardino) knew of their hidden minesin the mission territory.  His witnesses were students and priests,and one of these proving recalcitrant, the Bishop had him heavily chained,and then suspended outside the convent of the Franciscans.This drastic treatment had the desired effect, as torture always haswith reasonable men, and the poor witness signed, but afterwards protested,thus giving a good example in himself of the truth of the Spanish saying,`Protest and pay'.*--* `Pagar y apelar'.--By this time the patience and long-suffering of the Governorwere quite exhausted.  He therefore sent to the Bishop to say a ship was readyto take him down the river, and at the same time reminded him of his promiseat Yaguaron to obey the order of the Viceroy of Peru.  He sent the messageby the royal notary, Gomez de Coyeso, who accordingly repairedto the convent of San Francisco.  At the door a priest appeared,armed with a javelin, who three times tried to wound the notary,on which the Governor stationed a band of fifty soldiers at the convent gate,in spite of the presence of the statues of the Blessed Virgin and San Blas.Then, having published an edict that the Bishop was deposed,he proceeded to elect another in his stead.One of the canons, Don Cristobal Sanchez, who had governed the dioceseduring the interregnum before the advent of Don Bernardino,still lived in retirement near the town.  The Governor approached himwith the request that he would once more take the interim chargeuntil the King should send another Bishop to replace Cardenas.Sanchez consented, on the understanding that the Governor would guaranteehis personal safety.  This being done, Sanchez was taken to the Jesuit collegeas the securest place.So it fell out that everything concurred to strengthenthe hatred of the Bishop to the Jesuits.  To the Jesuit college camethe Governor and all the notables, and, having taken Sanchez in processionthrough the streets, they placed him on the Bishop's throne in the Cathedral,and invested him with all the power that he had held before the comingof Don Bernardino Cardenas.  The proclamation set forth by the Governoralluded to the informality of the consecration of Don Bernardino,and to his actions during his time of power.At last the Bishop saw that he must go.  So, after launchinga supreme anathema, and after having expressed his great unwillingnessto tarry longer in a city where half the population had incurredthe censure of the Church, and marked with a cross those churcheswhere he permitted Mass to be celebrated, he went on board the ship.Before embarking, he drew a silver bell from underneath his cloak,and to the sound of it he solemnly proclaimed the town accursed.The bells of the Franciscan convent and the Bishop's palace,according to his orders, all tolled loudly.  This causedso much confusion that, in order to appease the tumult,the authorities ordered the bells of all the churches in the town to ring.Entering the vessel, Don Bernardino sat himself upon the poopon a low stool, with all the clergy who were faithful to himgrouped about the deck.  With him he had the sacred wafer in a glass box,and not far off a group of sailors on the forecastle lounged aboutsmoking and drinking `mate' whilst they played at cards.Someone reminded him it was not fitting that God's Bodyshould thus be seen so near to sailors, and therefore the Bishop,according to the custom of the Church in cases of accident or desecration,consumed the offended wafer, and peace descended on the ship.Thus, in 1644, he took his first departure from the place wherefor the last two years he had brought certainly rather a sword than peace.His friends assured the public that, at the moment he stepped on boardthe ship, stars were seen to fall from heaven towards the church of St. Luke,and passed from thence to the episcopal palace and disappeared;that at the same time a slight shock of earthquake had been experienced;that stones had danced about, and several hills had trembled.The sun, quite naturally, had appeared blood-red; trouble and desolationhad entered every heart, and animals had prophesied woe and destruction,predicting ruin and misfortune to the town till the good Bishopshould return once more.The events of the past two years in Paraguay had not been favourableto the conversion of the Indians.  Not only in the missions,where the neophytes had seen themselves obliged to furnish troopsagainst their Bishop, but in the territory of Paraguay itself,the Indians had not had a good example of how Christians carry outthe duties of their faith.  As a general rule, the Indian (unlike the negro)cares little for dogma, but places his belief entirely in good works.Perhaps on this account the Jesuits, also believers in good works,have had the most success amongst them.  Be that as it may, the Jesuits,after the departure of the Bishop, found that many of their recent convertshad fallen away and gone back to the woods.Whilst Jesuits in Paraguay were seeking to convert the Indians,and whilst the Governor, no doubt, was thanking his stars forthe absence of his rival, in Rome the question of the Bishop's consecrationfilled all minds.  From May 9, 1645, to October 2 of the same yearno less than four congregations of the Propaganda had been heldabout the case.  The Pope himself was present at one of them.Nothing was arrived at till 1658, when finally the consecrationwas declared in order, but not until Don Bernardino was appointedto another see.Just about this time (1644-45) a rumour was set on foot that the Jesuitshad discovered mines near their reductions on the Parana.  These rumourswere always set about when there was nothing else by means of whichto attack the Jesuits.  An Indian by the name of Buenaventura,who had been a servant in a convent in Buenos Ayres, on this occasionwas the instrument used by their enemies.  For a short timeeveryone believed him, and excitement was intense; but, most unluckily,Buenaventura happened at the zenith of his notoriety to run awaywith a married woman, and, being pursued, was brought to Buenos Ayres,and then in public incontinently whipped.  In any other country Buenaventuraafter his public whipping would have been discredited, but a letter arrivedfrom the Bishop of Paraguay, telling the Governor of Buenos Ayresthat the mines really existed.  At that time a new Governor,one Don Jacinto de Lara, had just arrived.  Being new to America and its ways,he started out himself to try the question, and with fifty soldiers,taking Buenaventura as his guide, went to the missions.As might have been expected, on the journey Buenaventura disappeared,this time alone.  `Cette fuite lui donna beaucoup a\ penser,'says Charlevoix.  But having gone so far, the Governor determinedto try the question thoroughly.Father Diaz Tano, one of the best and hardest-working missionarieswho ever entered Paraguay, besought the Governor to satisfy himselfand search their territory for gold and silver, and requested himto call upon the Bishop for confirmation of the statements he had made.This he did, and then, accompanied by his soldiers, began his search.He gave out that the first man to find a mine should beat once promoted to be captain and have a large reward.After several days' march, and having found no mines,letters were brought him from the Governor of Paraguay and from the Bishop.The first informed him that he had heard rumours of mines,but nothing certain.  The second declined to specify the mines,which thus were destined to remain for ever, so to speak, `in partibus'.But he gave advice, and good advice is better than any mine,whether of silver or of gold.  He told the Governor to startby turning out the Jesuits, and he would find the profits of their expulsionjust as valuable as mines.Whether this also made the Governor pensive I do not know,but, luckily, the Jesuits, who were concerned in exposing the imposture,had come on Buenaventura, and brought him ironed to the Governor.He, after having tried to make him confess his imposture without success,condemned him to be hung.  The Jesuits, with their accustomed humanity(or ingenuity), begged for his life.  This was accorded to them,and once again Buenaventura received a good sound whipping for his pains.Thus ended the journey of Don Jacinto, without profit to himself,except so far as the experience gained.  No doubt he saw and markedthe Jesuit towns, the churches built of massive timber or of stone,and the contented air of Indians and priests, which always struckall travellers in those times.  He saw the countless herds of cattle,the cultivated fields; enjoyed, no doubt for the first time since arrivingin South America, the sense of perfect safety, at that time to be experiencedalone in Misiones.  But in despite of his exposure of the imposture,the rumour as to the existence of the mines never died out,and lingers even to-day, in spite of geological research in Paraguay.Whilst this was going on in Misiones, in the remote and recently-converteddistrict of the Itatines, in the north of Paraguay, the exampleset by the Bishop had borne its fruit.  The Indians became unmanageable.One of the chiefs broke into open rebellion, and wounded a Jesuit fathercalled Arenas at the very altar-steps.  Soon the general corruption of mannersbecame almost universal throughout the district.  This, I fancy,must be taken to mean that the Indians reverted to polygamy,for the Jesuits always had trouble in this matter, being unableto persuade the Indians of the advantage of monogamy.But most fortuitously, just as the general corruptiongained all hearts, a tiger rushed into the town, and, after killingfourteen people and some horses, disappeared again into the woods.The Jesuits, ever ready to take advantage of events like these,called on the Indians to see in the visitation of the tigerthe wrath of Heaven, and to leave their wicked ways.The Indians, always as willing to submit as to revolt, submitted,and the good fathers `prirent le parti de faire un coup d'autorite/,qui leur re/ussit,' as Charlevoix relates.They decoyed the chief, his nephew, and son, into another district,where they seized and shipped them off two hundred leaguesto a remote reduction across the Uruguay.  The Spaniards used to sayof Ferdinand VII., when he had committed any great barbarity,`He is quite a King' (`Es mucho Rey'), and the Indians of the Itatinesesteemed the Jesuits for their `coup d'autorite' in the same manneras the Spaniards their King.His usual luck attended Cardenas in his exile in Corrientes.  This town formedpart of the diocese of Buenos Ayres, which happened to be vacant at the time.He therefore took upon himself to act just as he had acted in Paraguay --appointed officers of justice, held ordinations, and instituted a campaignagainst the Jesuits of the town.Whilst he was thus occupied in his favourite pastime of usurpingother people's functions, two citations were sent himto appear before the High Court of Charcas.  He disregarded them,and sent a statement of his case by the hands of his nephewto the Bishop of Tucuman.  In the letter he set forth all his complaintsagainst the Governor of Paraguay, calling him a violator of the Church,a heretic, and generally applying to him all those termsin which a thwarted churchman usually exhales his rage.Mixed up with this was a detailed accusation of the Jesuits,to whose account he laid all his misfortunes whilst in Paraguay.Lastly, he called upon the Bishop of Tucuman to summon a provincial councilto condemn the monstrous heresies which he attributed to the Jesuits,reminding him that the Council of Trent had recommendedthe holding of frequent provincial councils, and stating his opinion that,unless a council were called at once, the Bishop would incur a mortal sin.The answer Cardenas received from Tucuman was most ironically couchedin the best style that his long-suffering friend was able to command.After addressing Cardenas as `your illustrious lordship',he proceeded to demolish all his statements in such a manner as to arguethat he had had much practice with refractory priests in his own diocese.He told him that the Jesuits were the only Order in Paraguaythat really worked amongst the Indians.  He reminded himthat from that Order the `second Paul', i.e., St. Francis Xavier,had himself issued.  He asked him whether, as a churchman,he thought the yearly sum of twelve thousand crowns given by the Kingout of the treasury of Buenos Ayres towards the Jesuits' workwas better saved, or that the thousands of Indians whomthe Jesuits had converted should be lost to God.  And as to heresy,he said he was no judge, leaving such matters to the Pope;but that no one accused the Jesuits of corruption in their morals,or of any of the greater crimes to which the great fragility of human naturerenders us liable.  He reminded him the Jesuits had made no accusationon their part, but always spoke of him with moderation and respect.And as to a provincial council, he said that it was impossible,for the following good cause:  The Bishop of Misque* was too infirm to travel;the Bishop of La Paz was lately dead, and the see still vacant;the Bishop of Buenos Ayres only just arrived, and too much occupiedto leave his diocese.  Therefore, the only Bishops availablewere himself and Cardenas, and that they never would agree.--* Misque is at least fifteen hundred miles from Tucuman.--`Moreover,' he remarked, `what is it that your illustrious lordshipwishes me to do?`To advise a Bishop?`God has only given me the charge of my own sheep.  Your lordship knowsas well as I do how a Bishop should comport himself.'He finished with a quotation, saying that a Bishop's statewas not to lie `in splendore vestium, sed morum; non ad iram,sed ut omnimodum patientium.'What Cardenas replied is not set down in any history which has come undermy observation, but what he must have thought is easy to divine.The Governor of Paraguay, not content with having put his case beforethe Supreme Court of Charcas, sent also to the Council General of the Indiesin Seville, detailing all the vagaries of the Bishop.  The Jesuits alsoempowered an officer to represent them there.During these preparations, and whilst everyone was off his guard,the Guaycurus endeavoured to surprise the capital, and wouldhave done so had not some regiments of Guaranis arrived in timefrom the mission territory.  This should have been an object-lessonto those who always tried to show the Jesuits in the light of enemiesto the authority of the King of Spain.  Nothing, however,proved of the least avail, and though on several occasions the Spanish powerin Paraguay was only saved by the exertions of the Jesuits and their Indians,the calumnies of Cardenas had taken too deep root to be dispelled.Meanwhile, in Corrientes, Cardenas schemed night and dayto return to Paraguay.  In his own city of La Plata naturally he hadsome friends, and these did all they could to get him reinstated.In spite of all their efforts, an order came from Charcasfor him to leave the city under pain of banishment.*  Anyone but Cardenaswould have been disconcerted; he, though, pretended, as in the orderhe was still styled Bishop of Paraguay, that before leaving for Charcas,to present himself before the court, he had to go to Asuncion to namea Vicar-General, and towards the end of 1646 he embarked upon the riverfor Paraguay.--* `Que lo hagan salir de nuestros Reynos y Sen~orios como ageno y estran~o,  por importar assi para la quietud de aquellas Provincias,  y al servicio de su Majestad.'--The Governor was on the alert, and sent a vessel with orders to turn him back,which order was carried out in spite of his remonstrances,and he returned to Corrientes in a miserable state.Then came another citation to appear at Charcas, and an intimationthat he was appointed Bishop of Popayan.  As Popayan (in New Granada)was at least three thousand miles from Asuncion, his joy at the appointmentmust have been extreme.His fortunes now seemed desperate; as he said himself in a letter to the King,`at an advanced age he could not undertake so great a journey';and on every side his enemies seemed to have got the upper hand.In 1648 a change came over everything.  Don Gregorio Hinestrosawas removed from Paraguay, and a new Governor, Don Diego Escobar de Osorio,appointed in his place.  Immediately the news reached Cardenashe set out for Paraguay.  Arriving at Asuncion, his friends all met himand took him in procession to the Cathedral.  His first thoughtwas to renew his persecution of the Jesuits.  Most unfortunately for them,Don Juan de Palafox, Bishop of Puebla de los Angeles in Mexico,who had himself in Mexico had many quarrels with the Jesuits,wrote begging Cardenas and all the Bishops of South Americato join against them.This Palafox was afterwards beatified, and even in his lifetime enjoyedthe reputation of a saint, so that his letter greatly strengthened Cardenas.Notwithstanding this, Palafox in subsequent works of his during the timethat he was Bishop of Osma (in Spain) said many things in praise of the workdone by the Jesuits in Paraguay.The new Governor, himself a member of the Supreme Court of Charcas,had never been before in Paraguay, and therefore resolved to treat the Bishop(as Don Gregorio had done) with every respect due to his station.The Bishop wanted nothing better, and saw at once he had another foolto deal with.  Therefore he made no secret of his intention of not complyingwith the citation of the court at Charcas, and set himself at onceto preach against the Jesuits, and stir up popular resentment against them.Unluckily, proof was wanting of the crimes he alleged they had committed,so he resorted to the device of getting a petition signed by all and sundry,asking for the expulsion of the Order from Paraguay.  Like all petitions,it was largely signed by women and by children and by thosewho had never thought before about the matter, but likedthe opportunity to write their names after the names of others,as sheep go through a gap or members give their votes (out of mere sympathy)in the high court of Parliament.This device having taken too much time, blank documentswere passed about for all to write upon whatever they imaginedto the disadvantage of the Jesuits.  By an untoward chance, a bundle of these,sent to the agent of the Bishop in Spain, was taken on the voyageby an English corsair.  The worthy pirate (no doubt a Protestant) was,if we can believe the Jesuits, extremely scandalized at the bad faith of thosewho used such means of wreaking their malevolence.So all seemed once again to smile upon Don Bernardino, who no doubt resumedhis flagellations, his midnight services, and his saying of two Masses,and once again became the idol of the people of Asuncion.But in the north, in the wild district of Caaguayu,hard by the mountains of Mbaracaya, close to the great `yerbales',*the Jesuits had formed two towns amongst the Indians.These two towns were destined to be the outposts of the countryagainst the incursions of the wild Indians from the Chaco.--* A `yerbal' is a forest chiefly composed of the `Ilex Paraguayensis',  from the leaves of which the `yerba mate', or `Paraguayan tea', is made.--The Bishop prevailed upon the Governor to let him turn out the Jesuitsand replace them by priests of another Order.  This being done,the Indians all deserted, leaving the district quite uninhabited.The court at Charcas, hearing of this folly, sent an order to the Governorto send the Jesuits back.  A year was passed in ceaseless searchingof the woods and deserts for the Indians, but only half of the populationcould ever be persuaded to return, and Father Mansilla, the ex-missionary,died of the hardships that he underwent.From that date down to the time of Dr. Francia (circa 1812-35),the district remained a desert.  Francia used it as a penal settlement,and to-day, save for a few wild, wandering Indians, known as Caaguas,and a sparse population of yerba-gatherers, it still remainsalmost unpopulated.Meanwhile, the general indignation against the Jesuits seemed to infectall classes of the population.  Certainly, the citizens of Asuncionhad good and sufficient causes of complaint against the Jesuits.On several occasions the efforts of the Jesuits and their Indians alonehad saved the capital from the wild Indians, and benefits are hard to bear,if only from their rarity.Popular hatred, to the full as idiotic as is popular applause,fell chiefly upon Father Diaz Tano -- he who had saved ten thousand Indiansfor the King of Spain in his celebrated retreat before the Mamelucosdown the Parana -- and he was frequently insulted in the streets.Father Antonio Manquiano, a quiet and learned man, was almost murderedin open day by a furious fanatic, who fell upon him withthe openly expressed intent `to eat his heart'.This was the moment Cardenas pitched on to declare the entireOrder of the Jesuits excommunicated.  As he had been a year away fromthe scene of his former exploits, people were not so used to excommunications,and therefore took them seriously.At this eventful juncture the Governor, Don Diego, died so suddenlythat suspicions of his having been poisoned were aroused.Scarce was he dead than all the population assembled at the palaceto elect an interim successor.  This was a most important thing,as to communicate with Spain took, at the very shortest time,about eight months.  By acclamation the choice fell on the Bishop,who thus found himself head of the spiritual and the temporal power at once.The election was absolutely illegal, as the Spanish lawprovided that, if a Governor of Paraguay should chance to die,the nomination of an interim successor should rest firstwith the Viceroy of Peru, and failing him with the High Court of Charcas.Cardenas based his election on the pretended edict of the Emperor Charles V.,but, if he had a copy of the edict, never produced it.  As usual,`good men daring not, and wise men caring not', but only fools and schemerstaking part in the election, no serious opposition to his usurpationwas encountered.Cardenas never doubted for a moment that the function of a Governorwas to govern, and he began at once to do so with a will.Xarque, a Spanish writer, gives the following curious description of howhe set about to get the people on his side to expel the Jesuits:*--* Xarque, book ii., cap. xl., p. 30.--Preaching one day in the Cathedral, after the consecrationhe turned towards the people, and, showing the holy wafer, said,`Do you believe, my brethren, that Jesus Christ is here?'All, being true believers, answered as one man that such was their belief.In the same way as at a scientific lecture, when the lecturerholds up some substance, and says, `You all know well thatcalcium tungstate or barium hydrocyanide has this or the other property,'the hearers nod assent like sheep, being afraid to contradictso glib a statement from so eminent a man.Then said Cardenas, `Believe as firmly that I have an order from the Kingto expel the Jesuits.'  The people all believed, and Cardenas forgotto tell them that by the expulsion of the Jesuits twenty thousand Indianswould pass into his power, whom he could then distribute amongst his friendsas slaves, as he proposed to divide the Indians of the missionsamongst the Paraguayan notables to win them to his side.Being at the head of everything in Asuncion, Cardenas no longer hesitated,but ordered an officer, Don Juan de Vallejo Villasanti,with a troop of soldiers to march to the college of the Jesuits.This he did, and finding the gates all barred, he burst them open,and, entering the college, signified to the rector an order from the Governor(duly countersigned by the Bishop) to leave the city with all his priests,and to evacuate all the missions on the Parana.  The rector answeredthat the Jesuits had a permission from Philip II., renewed by his successors,to found a college, and Father Tano exhibited the documents.Villasanti, who had but little love for documents, snatched the parchmentsfrom his hand, and the soldiers forced the Jesuits in a bodyto the port like sheep.  There they were tied and thrown into canoesalmost without provisions, and sent off down the river to Corrientes,the certain haven of the party in Paraguay which has got the worstof an election or a revolution, and wishes to gain time.Arrived in Corrientes, Don Manuel Cabral, a pious officer,received them in his house, and, curiously enough, the populationwelcomed the Jesuits with enthusiasm, and pressed them earnestlyto build a college in the town.Their college at Asuncion was treated like a town taken by storm:pulpit and font, confessionals and doors, all were torn down and burnt,and, with a view of justifying what was done, the Bishop's partisansspread a report that, as the Jesuits were heretics, their temple was unclean.The population, more artistic in its instincts than the Bishop,refused to allow the altar, which had been brought from Spain,to be destroyed.  Besides the altar, there were also statuesof San Ignacio and San Francisco Xavier.  These the Bishop wishedto turn into St. Peter and St. Paul.  With this design he gave themto an Indian carpenter to work upon.  The poor man did his best,but only managed to turn out two monstrous blocks, which looked likenothing human.A statue of the Blessed Virgin which had the eyes turned up to heaventhe Bishop wished to alter, and replace the head by another with the eyesturned down to earth, as being more befitting to the statue's sex.The people, less mad or superstitious than the Bishop, refused to allow it,and the image, too, was placed in the Cathedral.In 1649 the expulsion of an Order so powerful as were the Jesuits causedsome commotion through the world at large.  Miracles happened opportunelyto strengthen waning faith.  A fire placed round their church,though it destroyed, refused to blacken; and ropes fixedto the tower of the church, although attached to windlasses,refused to pull it down, so that the tower and church, though gutted,still remained almost intact, and, on the Jesuits' return,were easily repaired, and served as a monument of victory.Uneasy lies the head that wears a mitre, as poor Cardenas found out.His popularity suffered some decrease by the lack of treasure foundin the Jesuits' college, for he had always dangled millions in prospectivebefore the people's eyes to engage them on his side, and, most unluckily,he had no millions to bestow.  So, to make all things right,he sent Fray Diego Villalon* to Madrid to represent his interests.--* This Villalon has left some curious memoirs in the case which he submitted  to the Council of the Indies which sat in Seville.--The Jesuits upon their side were not inactive.  By virtue ofa brief of Gregory XIII. they had the privilege of appointing an officialcalled a judge conservator in cases where their honour or their possessionswere attacked.  Therefore Father Alfonso de Ojeda was sent to Charcasto arrange about the case.  At Charcas they found that Cardenashad been before them, and had instituted proceedings against their Orderin the High Court.  Father Pedro Nolasco, Superior of the Order of Mercy,was appointed judge conservator.  He at once summoned the Bishopto appear before him, and arranged to try the case and hear the evidence.Cardenas having refused to appear, sentence went by default against him.The High Court, being convinced that the pretended edictof the Emperor Charles V. did not exist, appointed Don Andres Garabito de Leonto be interim Captain-General of Paraguay, and gave him power, if necessary,to restore order by force of arms.  The court then issued a decreesummoning Cardenas to appear at once at Charcas and give his reasonswhy he had had himself made Governor and had expulsed the Jesuitsfrom Paraguay.  It then communicated with the Marquis of Mancera,Viceroy of Peru, who quite concurred in its decision as to Cardenas.Apparently upon the principle which prevails amongst Mohammedansof always appointing, first an officer, and then a caliph to that officerto do the work, the High Court of Charcas also appointed a commanderto proceed to Paraguay, pending the time that Don Andres should feel inclinedto start himself.  As the caliph's name was Sebastian de Leon,it is not improbable that he was a relation of the first-appointed man.Don Sebastian de Leon seems to have been in Paraguay already,for both Charlevoix and Xarque agree that he and his brothers,after the expulsion of the Jesuits by Cardenas, had retired to an estatesome distance from Asuncion.  At the estate the news of his appointmentreached him, and must have placed him in a most difficult positionas to what to do.On several occasions in the various rebellions which occurred in South Americaduring the Spanish rule, men were appointed to quell rebellions,pacify countries, and restore order, and all without an army or any forcesbeing placed at their command.  This was the case withthe celebrated La Gasca, who was sent from Spain to put downthe rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro, and succeeded in so doing,though he left Spain without a single soldier in his train.In this connection it is to be remembered that none of the rebellions inSpanish America from the days of Charles I. (i.e., the Emperor Charles V.)to those of Charles III. were for the object of separationfrom the metropolis, but merely risings against Governors sent out from Spain.It seems that both in Peru and Paraguay the very name of the imperial powerwas able to draw hundreds of men to the standard of whatever officer helda commission from Madrid, such as that held by Garabito de Leon or by La Gascaon the Parana.At first Don Sebastian did not show himself in Asuncion,but sent out messengers on every side to summon soldiers, requisition horses,and collect provisions.  He also sent to Corrientes to tell the Jesuitshe was ready to reinstate them in their possessions.Don Bernardino meanwhile was preparing for the great adventure of his life.He seems to have believed most firmly that no power on earthhad any right to remove him from the governorship of Paraguay.In a letter which he addressed to Don Juan Romero de la Cruz*he says he is on the point of distinguishing himselfby heroic exploits and great victories; that he had on his sidejustice and force (a most uncommon combination); that the entire capitalwas favourable to him; and that he was resolved neither to readmit the Jesuitsnor to recognise Don Sebastian de Leon as Governor.--* Charlevoix, book xii., p. 115.--Asuncion was once again convulsed, and all was preparation for the holy war.The Bishop had given out that angels were to help him,and this so reassured his soldiers that they provided themselves with cordsto bind the Indians in the army of Don Sebastian Leon, thinking theywould fall an easy prey to them.  This matter of the cords explains, perhaps,why the population of Asuncion was almost unanimous in favour of the Bishop.In the army of Don Sebastian, as well as the militia of the province,marched three thousand Indians from the Jesuit reductions on the Parana.The Spaniards of the capital were all determined not to kill any of them,but keep them alive for slaves, and hence the cords with whichthey armed themselves.The sacred generalissimo led out his army from Asuncion in person,celebrating Mass himself, and then heading his troopslike many another Spanish ecclesiastic has done before and after him,and continued doing even to the latest Carlist war.The armies met not far from Luque, in a little plain knownas the Campo Grande.  An open plain with sandy soil, which gave the horsesa good footing, with several little stagnant pools in the centrewhere the wounded men could drink and wash their wounds,with a most convenient forest on all sides for the deserters and the cowardsto hide in, made a good battlefield.  The village of Luque,grouped round its church, and with a little plaza in the middlein which sat Paraguayan women selling mandioca, chipa,*1* and rapadura,*2*with sacks of maize and of mani,*3* stood on the summit of a little hill.Upon the plain the earth is red, and looks as if a battlehad been fought upon it and much blood spilt.  In all directionsrun little paths, worn deep by the feet of mules and horses,and in which the rider has to lift his feet as if he were goingthrough a stream.  To Asuncion there leads one of the deep-sunk roadsplanted with orange and paraiso*4* trees, constructed thus(as Barco de la Centenera tells us in his `Argentina') so as to be defensibleagainst the Indians after the country was first conquered by the Spaniards.--*1* Chipa is a kind of bread made of mandioca flour.*2* Rapadura is a kind of coarse sugar, generally sold    in little pyramid-shaped lumps, done up in a banana leaf.    It is strongly flavoured with lye.*3* Mani is ground-nut.  ["Peanut" in American English.  -- A. L., 1998.]*4* The paraiso is one of the Paulinias.--On the Bishop's side hardly a soldier but thought himself an emissary of God,or doubted of the victory for a moment in his heart.  Angels themselveshad promised victory to their leader, who, to make all things safe,had issued a proclamation punishing surrender with the pain of death;so they stood quietly in array of battle waiting to be attacked.Upon his side, Don Sebastian Leon, seeing the attitude of the enemy,immediately ordered an advance, and charged himself, with all his cavalry,upon the Bishop's men.  They, with the firmness that fanatics so often show,stood firmly in their ranks, thinking themselves invulnerable.Their valour proved but momentary, for at the second chargethey broke their ranks and fled.  Flight turned to rout,and Don Sebastian having commanded that they should not be pursued,they still fled on, no man pursuing them.The Governor then entered the capital without resistance.On the plaza he stopped, and having gathered up the woundedwithout respect of party, he sent them to the hospital.Then, having seen to the safety of the town, he rode to the Cathedralto give thanks to God for having preserved him from the dangers of the fight.Dressed in his robes and seated on his throne was Cardenas.  Don Sebastianentered the church, dismounted, and kissed his hand respectfully,like a true Spaniard, and asked him ceremoniously to deign to give himthe baton of the civil power.  Cardenas answered not a word,but handed him the baton, and then retired, accompanied by all his priests.The victory did not terminate the work of Don Sebastian.After a reasonable interval, and before witnesses, he cited the Bishopto appear before the court of Charcas.  The Bishop promised to obey,thinking he had another Don Gregorio Hinostrosa to deal with,but quite determined never to comply, acting according tothe custom of Governors in South America, who, when an orderreached them from Madrid, either absurd or quite impossible to execute,solemnly answered, `I obey, but I do not comply,'* saving by the phrasethe honour of their sovereigns and themselves.  Upon their sidethe Jesuits pressed the judge conservator, Father Nolasco,to issue his sentence, and free them from the charges under which they lay.This he did, and gave as his opinion they were quite innocent of allthat Cardenas had laid to their account.--* `Obedesco, pero no cumplo.'--As in a palace,* things go slow in Spain, and it was not till 1654that a royal decision confirmed the judgment of Nolasco, and freed the Jesuitsfrom all the charges raised against them.--* `Cosas de palacio van despacio.'--Order restored, Cardenas deprived of his usurped authority,and the Jesuits reinstated, the temporary commission of Sebastian Leonwas at an end.  Therefore he retired again to plant his mandiocaunder his own guayaba-tree.  Yet feeling ran so high that he was hardly safefrom the vengeance of the partisans of Cardenas, so that he found himselfonce more obliged to summon the militia of the province,and lead them to a perfunctory campaign against the Payaguas.These Indians the earlier historians of the conquest,Barco de la Centenera and Rui Diaz de Guzman, describe as river-pirates,almost living in canoes, and dashing out on any passing Spanish vesselthat they thought weak enough.  The Jesuits Montoya and Dobrizhoffer tell usthat they went naked, painted in many colours, with a hawk's or parrot's wingpassed through the cartilage of their left ear, and that they were,of all the Indians of Paraguay, the most indomitable.  A few,when I knew Paraguay some twenty years ago, hung round Asuncion,squalid and miserable, passing their time in fishing in canoes,and as attached to their own mode of life as when the first discovererscalled them `sweet-water pirates' and the `most pestilent of all the Indianson the river Paraguay.'  The Payaguas chastised, Don Sebastian,upon one pretext or another, did not disband his troops,keeping them always by him, and thus making the position of the Bishopquite untenable, till by degrees his followers fell away and left himalmost deserted and his party all dissolved.  Seeing the game was up,the Bishop, after having named one Don Adrian Cornejo as his suffragan,took his departure (1650) for Charcas to appear before the court.For eight tumultuous years he had kept his bishopric in a perpetual turmoil,having been the evil genius of the land.What sort of man he really was is hard to-day to judge, for Xarque, Villalon,Charlevoix, and Dean Funes,* who chronicle his doings, were all,on one side or the other, partisans.  The Jesuits condemn him as a spoliator,the Franciscans hold him up as one who fought throughout his lifefor the honour of the founder of their rule.  Tracts, books,and pamphlets for and against him have been written in numbers,and in the history of the times in Paraguay his name bulks large.One thing is certain -- that the Indians loved and revered him,and followed him up to the end.  Even in Charcas, where he lived for yearsupon a pension of two thousand crowns allowed him by the Kingwhilst his case dragged its weary course to Rome, Madrid, back to Peru,and then to Rome again, the Indians, when he appeared in public,greeted him with flowers.  He may have been a saint:  so many men are saints,and the world knows them not.  He may have been a schemer; but he madenothing by his schemes except the barren honour of his consecrationto the see of Paraguay.  A preacher certainly he was, able and willingto draw crowds, after the fashion of all those who have the gift of words.--* Dean Funes, in his `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay,  Buenos Ayres y Tucuman' (book ii., cap. i., p. 10), says he was  `Dotado de un temperamento muy facil de inflamarse, de una imaginacion viva,  de una memoria feliz, y de un ingenio no vulgar.'--Headstrong and obstinate, through a long life he hated vigorously,thinking all those who differed from him were accursed of God.A strenuous member of the Church militant on earth, he was at leasta personality, and those who read the history of his time must reckon with,and take sides for or against, him after the fashion of the menwith whom he passed his life, who to a man revered him as a saint,or looked upon him as a devil sent to plague mankind.Arrived in Charcas, he soon fell on evil times, although at firsthe made some partisans.  Still looking back to Paraguay, he passed his timein drawing out petitions to the King; then, one by one, all his friendsfell from him, except some faithful Indians, who considered him a saint.His dreams of saintship were not fulfilled, for his name never figuredin the calendar.  Years did not tame nor yet did hope ever completelyleave him; for in old books I find him always protesting, ever complaining,and still striving, till, in 1665, Philip IV. in pity made himBishop of Santa Cruz.  A sentence from the registers of the Consistory at Romeinforms us that, as Bishop of La Paz, in his own province of the Charcas,he left off troubling, and rested from his agitated life.Chapter VI  Description of the mission territory and towns founded by the Jesuits --  Their endeavours to attract the Indians -- Religious feasts and processions  -- Agricultural and commercial organizationsWith the death of Cardenas the most dangerous enemy the Jesuitsever had in Paraguay had disappeared.  They worsted him, and drove himfrom his see; but the movement set on foot by him and the calumnieshe levelled at their Order still remained and flourished,and in the end prevailed against them and drove them from the land.A calumny is hard to kill; mankind in general cherish it;they never let it die, and, if it languishes, resuscitate itunder another form; they hold to it in evil and in good repute,so that, once fairly rooted, it goes on growing like a forest-treethroughout the centuries.  Therefore, the charges againstthe Jesuits in Paraguay, which Cardenas first started,are with us still, and warp our judgment as to the doings of the Orderin the missions of the Parana and Uruguay even until to-day.But neither calumny nor the raids of the Paulistas, nor yetthe jealousy of the Spanish settlers in Paraguay, deterred the Jesuitsfrom the prosecution of their task.  The missions gradually extended,till they ranged from Santa Maria la Mayor, in Paraguay,to San Miguel, in what is now Brazil; and from Jesus, upon the Parana,to Yapeyu, upon the Uruguay.  Most of the country, with the exception ofthe missions of Jesus and Trinidad, upon the Parana, which to-day, at least,are only clearings in the primeval forest, is composed of open rolling plains,with wood upon the banks of all the streams.  Covered as it was and iswith fine, short grass, it formed excellent cattle-breeding country,and hence the great industry of the Indians was to look after stock.The country being so favourable for cattle, they multiplied immoderately,so that in the various establishments (`estancias'), according tothe inventories published by Brabo, their numbers were immense.*--* At the date of the expulsion the number of the cattle  was 719,761; oxen, 44,183; horses, 27,204; sheep, 138,827  (`Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas',  Francisco Javier Brabo, Madrid, 1872).--These open rolling plains, called by the natives `campos quebrantados',are generally studded thickly with stunted palms called yatais,*1*but not so thickly as to spoil the grass which covers themin spring and early summer, and even in winter they remaingood feeding ground.  Thick clumps of hard-wood trees*2*break up the prairie here and there into peninsulas and islands,and in the hollows and rocky valleys bushy palmetto rises abovea horse's knees.  In general the soil is of a rich bright red, which,gleaming through the trees, gives a peculiarly warm colour to the land.All the French Jesuit writers refer to it as `la terre rouge des missions'.The Jesuits used it and another earth of a yellow shade for paintingtheir churches and their houses in the mission territory.  Its compositionis rather sandy, though after rain it makes thick mud, and renders travellingmost laborious.  The flowers and shrubs of the territoryare quite as interesting and still more varied than are the trees.Many of the Jesuits were botanists, and the works of Fathers Montenegro,*3*Sigismund Asperger and Lozano are most curious, and givedescriptions and lists of many of the plants unclassified even to-day.The celebrated Bonpland, so long detained by Dr. Francia in Paraguay,unfortunately never published anything; but modern writers*4* have done much,though still the flora of the whole country is but most imperfectly known,and much remains to do before it is all classified.  The `Croton succirubrus'(from which a resin known as `sangre-de-drago' is extracted),the sumaha (bombax -- the fruit of which yields a fine vegetable silk),the erythroxylon or coca of Paraguay, the incienso or incense-treeof the Jesuits, are some of the most remarkable of the myriad shrubs.But if the shrubs are myriad, the flowers are past the power of man to count.Lianas, with their yellow and red and purple clusters of blossoms,like enormous bunches of grapes, hang from the forest-trees.In the open glades upon the nandubays,*5* the algarrobos,and the espinillos, hang various Orchidaceae,*6* called by the natives`flores del aire', covering the trees with their aerial roots,their hanging blossoms, and their foliage of tender green.The Labiatae, Compositae, Daturae, Umbelliferae, Convolvulaceae,and many other species, cover the ground in spring or run up trees and bushesafter the fashion of our honeysuckle and the traveller's joy.--*1* `Cocos yatais'.*2* Urunday (`Astrenium fraxinifolium:  Terebinthaceae'),    curapay (`Piptadenia communis:  Leguminaceae'),    lapacho (`Tecoma curialis' and `varia:  Begoniaceae'),    taruma (`Vitex Taruma:  Verbenaceae'), tatane (`Acacia maleolens:    Leguminaceae'), and cupai (`Copaifera Langsdorfii').    These and many other woods, such as the Palo Santo    (`Guaiacum officinalis'), butacae, and the `Cedrela Braziliensis',    known to the Jesuits as `cedar', and much used by them in their churches,    comprise the chief varieties.*3* `Libro compuesto por el Hermano Pedro de Montenegro de la C. de J.,    Ano 1711', MS. folio, with pen-and-ink sketches, formerly belonged    to the Dukes of Osuna, and was in their library.  Padre Sigismundi    also wrote a herbal in Guarani, and a Portuguese Jesuit, Vasconellos,    has left a curious book upon the flora of Brazil.*4* Domingo Parodi, in his `Notas sobre algunas plantas usuales del Paraguay'    (Buenos Ayres, 1886), has done much good work.*5* `Acacia Cavenia'.*6* `Prosopis dulcis'.  The famous `balm of the missions',    known by the vulgar name of `curalo todo' (all-heal),    was made from the gum of the tree called aguacciba,    one of the Terebinthaceae.  It was sold by the Jesuits in Europe.    It was so highly esteemed that the inhabitants of the villages    near to which the tree was found were specially enjoined    to send a certain quantity of the balsam every year    to the King's pharmacy in Madrid.--The lakes and backwaters of rivers are covered withmyriads of water-lilies (all lumped together by the natives as `camalote'),whilst in the woodland pools the Victoria Regis carpets the waterwith its giant leaves.  In every wood the orange and the lemonwith the sweet lime have become wild, and form great thickets.Each farm and `rancho' has its orange-grove, beneath the shade of whichI have so often camped, that the scent of orange-blossomalways brings back to me the dense primeval woods, the silent plains,the quiet Indians, and the unnavigated waterways, in whichthe alligators basked.  Except the Sierra de Mbaracayu,*1*on the north-east, throughout the mission territory there areno mountains of considerable height; and through the middle of the countryrun the rivers Parana and Uruguay, the latter forming the boundaryon the south-east.  The rolling plains and woods alternatewith great marshes called `esteros', which in some districts,as of that of Neembucu, cover large tracts of land, forming in winteran almost impenetrable morass, and in the spring and early summerexcellent feeding-ground for sheep.  Throughout the territorythe climate is healthy, except towards the woody northern hills.With this rich territory and the false reports of mines,which even unsuccessful exploration could not dispel, it is but naturalthat the Jesuits were hated far and wide.  It must have been annoyingto a society composed, as were the greater portion of the Spanish settlementsin Paraguay, of adventurers, who treated the Indians as brute beasts,*2*to see a preserve of Indians separated from their territoryby no great barrier of Nature, and still beyond their power.*3*Bonpland, in speaking of the country, says:  `The whole of the landexceeds description; at every step one meets with things useful and newin natural history.'  Such also was the opinion of the French travellersDemersay and D'Orbigny; of Colonel du Graty, whose interesting work(`La Re/publique du Paraguay', Brussels, 1862) is one of the beston the country; the recent French explorer Bourgade la Dardye,and of all those who have ever visited the missions of Paraguay.*4*--*1* It was from those mountains that the Jesuits procured    the seed of the `Ilex Paraguayensis' to plant in their reductions.    The leaves beaten into a finish powder furnished the `Paraguayan tea',    called `yerba-mate' by the Spaniards and `caa' by the Indians,    from which the Jesuits derived a handsome revenue.    After the expulsion of the Order all the `yerba' in Paraguay was procured,    till a few years ago, from forests in the north of Paraguay,    in which the tree grew wild.*2* It was by the Bull of Paul III. -- given at the demand of two monks,    Fray Domingo de Betanzos and Fray Domingo de Minaya -- that the Indians    were first considered as reasoning men (`gente de razon'),    and not as unreasonable beings (`gente sin razon'), as Juan Ortiz,    Bishop of Santa Marta, wished.*3* Ibanez (`Histoire du Paraguay sous les Je/suites M.D.CCIXXX.'),    a great opponent of the Jesuits, says that European offenders    and recalcitrant Indians in the missions were sent as a last resource    to the Spanish settlements.  This is not astonishing when we remember    the curious letter of Don Pedro Faxardo, Bishop of Buenos Ayres    (preserved by Charlevoix), written in 1721 to the King of Spain,    in which he says he thinks `that not a mortal crime is committed    in the missions in a year.'  He adds that, `if the Jesuits were so rich,    why are their colleges so poor?'*4* It is to be remembered that, of the thirty Jesuit missions,    only eight were in Paraguay; the rest were in what to-day is Brazil    and the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios, Corrientes, and Misiones.--In this rich territory the Jesuits, when, after infinite trouble,they had united a sufficient* quantity of Indians, formed them into townships,almost all of which were built upon one plan.  In Paraguay itselfonly some three or four remain; but they remain so well preserved that,by the help of contemporary accounts, it is easy to reconstruct almost exactlywhat the missions must have been like during the Jesuits' rule.**--* Sometimes, when they had been assembled, they all deserted suddenly,  as did the Tobatines, who in 1740 suddenly left the reduction of Santa Fe,  and for eleven years were lost in the forests, till Father Yegros  found them, and, as they would not return, established himself amongst them  (Cretineau Joly, `Histoire de la Compagnie de Je/sus', vol. v., cap. ii.).** P. Cardiel, `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 282:  `Todos los pueblos   estan bien formados con calles a/ cordel.  Las casas de los Indios   son en algunos pueblos de piedras cuadradas pero sin cal   . . . otras de palos y barro todas cubiertas de teja,   y todas tienen soportales o/ corredores, unas con pilares de piedras,   otras de madera.'--Built round a square, the church and store-houses filled one end,and the dwellings of the Indians, formed of sun-dried bricks or wattled canesin three long pent-houses, completed the three sides.  In general, the houseswere of enormous length, after the fashion of a St. Simonian phalanstery,or of a `miners' row' in Lanarkshire.  Each family had its own apartments,which were but separated from the apartments of the nextby a lath-and-plaster wall, called in Spanish `tabique''but one veranda and one roof served for a hundred or more families.The space in the middle of the square was carpeted with the finest grass,kept short by being pastured close by sheep.  The churches,sometimes built of stone, and sometimes of the hard woodswith which the country abounds, were beyond all description splendid,taking into consideration the remoteness of the Jesuit townsfrom the outside world.  Frequently -- as, for instance,in the mission of Los Apostoles -- the churches had three aisles,and were adorned with lofty towers, rich altars,*1* super-altars,and statuary, brought at great expense from Italy and Spain.Though the churches were often built of stone, it was not usualfor the houses of the Indians to be so built; but in situationswhere stone was plentiful, as at the mission of San Borja,the houses of the Jesuits were of masonry, with verandas held up by columns,and with staircases with balustrades of sculptured stone.*2*The ordinary ground-plan of the priest's house was thatof the Spanish Moorish dwelling, so like in all its details to a Roman houseat Pompeii or at Herculaneum.  Built round a square courtyard,with a fountain in the middle, the Jesuits' house formedbut a portion of a sort of inner town, which was surrounded by a wall,in which a gate, closed by a porter's lodge, communicated withthe outside world.  Within the wall was situated the church(although it had an entrance to the plaza), the rooms of the inferior priest,a garden, a guest-chamber, stables, and a store-house, in which were keptthe arms belonging to the town, the corn, flour, and wool,and the provisions necessary for life in a remote and often dangerous place.In every case the houses were of one story; the furniture was modest,and in general home-made; in every room hung images and pious pictures,the latter often painted by the Indians themselves.  In the smaller missionstwo Jesuits managed all the Indians.*3*--*1* Don Francisco Graell, an officer of dragoons in service    during the War of the Seven Towns in 1750, gives the following description    of the church of the mission of San Miguel:  `La iglesia es muy capaz,    toda de piedra de silleria con tres naves y media naranja.  Muy bien    pintada y dorada con un portico magnifico y de bellisima arquitectura,    bovedas y media naranja son de madera, el altar mayor de talla,    sin dorar y le falta el ultimo cuerpo.'*2* `Galerias con columnas, barandillas y escaleras de piedra entallada'    (Don Francisco Graell).  See also P. Cardiel (`Declaracion de la Verdad',    p. 247), `En todos los pueblos hay reloj de sol y de ruedas,' etc.    The work of Padre Cardiel was written in 1750 in the missions of Paraguay,    but remained unpublished till 1800, when it appeared in Buenos Ayres    from the press of Juan A. Alsina, Calle de Mexico 1422.  It is, perhaps,    after the `Conquista Espiritual' of Father Ruiz Montoya,    the most powerful contemporary justification of the policy of the Jesuits    in Paraguay.  It is powerfully but simply written, and contains withal    that saving grace of humour which has, from the beginning of the world,    been a stumbling-block to fools.*3* The mission of San Miguel had 1,353 families in it, or say 6,635 souls.    San Francisco de Borja contained 650 families, or 2,793 souls    (Report by Manuel Querini to the King, dated Cordoba de Tucuman,    y Agosto 1o, 1750).--The greatest difficulty which the Jesuits had to facewas the natural indolence of their neophytes.  Quite unaccustomed as they wereto regular work of any kind, the ordinary European system,as practised in the Spanish settlements, promptly reduced them to despair,and often killed them off in hundreds.  Therefore the Jesuits institutedthe semi-communal system of agriculture and of public works with whichtheir name will be associated for ever in America.*--* In their extensive missions in the provinces of Chiquitos and Moxos  they pursued the same system.  As they were much more isolated  in those provinces than in Paraguay, and consequently much less  interfered with, it was there that their peculiar system most flourished.  After the expulsion of the Jesuits from America in 1767,  the Spaniards in Alta Peru, and subsequently the Bolivians,  had the sense to follow the Jesuit plan in its entirety; whereas Bucareli,  the Viceroy of Buenos Ayres, entirely changed the Jesuits' rule in Paraguay.  The consequence was that in Bolivia the Indians, instead of dispersing  as they did in Paraguay, remained in the missions, and D'Orbigny  (`Fragment d'un Voyage au Centre de l'Ame/rique Me/ridianale')  saw at the missions of Santiago and El Santo Corazon,  in the province of Chiquitos, the remains of the Jesuits' polity.  There were ten missions in Chiquitos, and fifteen in Moxos.  At the present time the Franciscans have some small establishments  in Bolivia.--The celebrated Dr. Francia, dictator of Paraguay, used to refer to the Jesuitsas `cunning rogues',*1* and, as he certainly himself was versedin every phase of cunningness, perhaps his estimate -- to some extent,at least -- was just.  A rogue in politics is but a manwho disagrees with you; but, still, it wanted no little knowledge of mankindto present a daily task to men, unversed in any kind of labour,as of the nature of a pleasure in itself.  The difficulty was enormous,as the Indians seemed never to have come under the primeval curse,but passed their lives in wandering about, occasionally cultivatingjust sufficient for their needs.  Whether a missionary, Jesuit, or Jansenist,Protestant, Catholic, or Mohammedan, does well in forcinghis own mode of life and faith on those who live a happier, freer lifethan any his instructor can hold out to them is a moot point.  Only the futurecan resolve the question, and judge of what we do to-day -- no doubtwith good intentions, but with the ignorance born of our self-conceit.Much of the misery of the world has been brought about with good intentions;but of the Jesuits, at least, it can be said that what they did in Paraguaydid not spread death and extinction to the tribes with whom they dealt.*2*So to the task of agriculture the Jesuits marshalled their neophytesto the sound of music, and in procession to the fields,with a saint borne high aloft, the community each day at sunrise took its way.Along the paths, at stated intervals, were shrines of saints,and before each of them they prayed, and between each shrine sang hymns.*3*As the procession advanced, it became gradually smaller as groups of Indiansdropped off to work the various fields, and finally the priest and acolytewith the musicians returned alone.*4*  At mid-day, before eating,they all united and sang hymns, and then, after their meal and siesta,returned to work till sundown, when the procession again re-formed,and the labourers, singing, returned to their abodes.  A pleasing and Arcadianstyle of tillage, and different from the system of the `swinked' labourerin more northern climes.  But even then the hymnal day was not concluded;for after a brief rest they all repaired to church to sing the `rosary',and then to sup and bed.  On rainy days they worked at other industriesin the same half-Arcadian, half-communistic manner, only they sang their hymnsin church instead of in the fields.  The system was so differentto that under which the Indians endured their lives in the `encomiendas'and the `mitas' of the Spanish settlements, that the fact aloneis sufficient to account for much of the contemporary hatredwhich the Jesuits incurred.--*1* `Pillos muy ladinos' (Robertson, `Letters from Paraguay').*2* Ferrer del Rio, in his `Coleccion de los articulos    de la Esperanza sobre Carlos III.' (Madrid, 1859), says:    `Fuera de las misiones de los Jesuitas particularmente en el Paraguay    se consideraban los Indios entre los seres mas infelices del mundo.'    Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa, in their celebrated `Secret Report'    (`Noticias Secretas de America'):  `La compan~ia (de Jesus) atiende    a sus fines particularmente con los misioneros que llevan de Espan~a;    pero con todo eso no se olvida de la conversion de los Indios,    ni tiene abandonado este asunto pues aunque van poco adelante en el,    que es lo que no se esperimenten en las demas religiones.'*3* Many travellers, as Azara, Demersay, Du Graty, and D'Orbigny,    have remarked how fond of music was the Guarani race,    and how soon they learned the use of European instruments.  D'Orbigny    (`Fragment d'un Voyage au Centre de l'Ame/rique Me/ridianale'),    in his interesting account of the mission of El Santo Corazon,    in the district of Chiquitos, says:  `Je fus tre\s e/tonne/    d'entendre exe/cuter apre\s les danses indige\nes des morceaux    de Rossini et . . . de Weber . . . la grande messe chante/e en musique    e/tait exe/cute/e d'une manie\re tre\s remarquable pour des Indiens.'    Vargas Machuca, in his most curious and rare `Milicia y Descripcion    de las Indias', says, under the heading of `Musica del Indio':    `Usan sus musicas antiguas en sus regocijos, y son muy tristes    en la tonada.'  To-day the Indians of Paraguay have songs    known as `tristes'.  The brigadier Don Diego de Alvear,    in his `Relacion de Misiones' (Coleccion de Angelis),    says that the first to teach the Guaranis European music    was a Flemish Jesuit, P. Juan Basco, who had been `maestro de capilla'    to the Archduke Albert.*4* See also P. Cardiel, `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 274:    `. . . y esta acabada, se toca a/ Misa a/ que entran todos cantando    el Bendito, y alabado en su lengua, o/ en Castellano,    que en las dos lenguas lo saben.'--Imagine a semi-communistic settlement set close to the borders of Rhodesia,in which thousands of Kaffirs passed a life analogous to thatpassed by the Indians of the missions -- cared for and fed by the community,looked after in every smallest particular of their lives --and what a flood of calumny would be let loose upon the unfortunatedevisers of the scheme!  Firstly, to withdraw thousands of `natives'from the labour market would be a crime against all progress,and then to treat them kindly would be heresy, and to seclude themfrom the contamination of the scum of Europe in the settlementswould be termed unnatural; for we know that native races derive most benefitfrom free competition with the least fitted of our population to instruct.But besides agriculture the enormous cattle-farms* of the mission territorygave occupation to many of the neophytes.  The life on cattle-farmsgave less scope for supervision, and we may supposethat the herders and the cattlemen were more like Gauchos;but Gauchos under religious discipline, half-centaurs in the field,sitting a plunging half-wild colt as if they were part of him,and when on foot at home submissive to the Jesuits, constant in church,but not so fierce and bloodthirsty as their descendants soon becameafter the withdrawal of the mission rule.--* Dean Funes, in his `Ensayo de la Historia del Paraguay', etc.,  says that in the `estancia' of Santa Tecla, in the missions of Paraguay,  during the time of the Jesuits, there were 50,000 head of cattle.--As well as agriculture and `estancia' life, the Jesuits had introducedamongst the Indians most of the arts and trades of Europe.By the inventories taken by Bucareli, Viceroy of Buenos Ayres,at the expulsion of the Order, we find that they wove cotton largely;sometimes they made as much as eight thousand five hundred yards of clothin a single town in the space of two or three months.*And, in addition to weaving, they had tanneries, carpenters' shops,tailors, hat-makers, coopers, cordage-makers, boat-builders,cartwrights, joiners, and almost every industry useful and necessary to life.They also made arms and powder, musical instruments, and had silversmiths,musicians, painters, turners, and printers to work their printing-presses:for many books were printed at the missions,** and they produced manuscriptsas finely executed as those made by the monks in European monasteries.--* `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas',  Introduction, xxvii, Francisco Javier Brabo.** The rare and much-sought-after `Manuale ad usum Patrum Societatis Jesu   qui in Reductionibus Paraquariae versantur, ex Rituale Romano   ad Toletano decerptum', was printed at the mission of Loreto.   It contains prayers in Guarani as well as in Latin.   Here also was printed a curious book of Guarani sermons   by Nicolas Yapuguay, many Guarani vocabularies,   and the `Arte de la Lengua Guarani/' of Ruiz Montoya.--All the `estancias', the agricultural lands and workshops were, so to speak,the property of the community; that is to say, the communityworked them in common, was fed and maintained by their productions,the whole under the direction of the two Jesuits who lived in every town.A portion called `tupinambal' in Guarani was set aside especiallyfor the maintenance of orphans and of widows.  The cattle and the horses,with the exception of `los caballos del santo', destined for show at feasts,were also used in common.  The surplus of the capital was reservedto purchase necessary commodities from Buenos Ayres and from Spain.*Each family received from the common stock sufficient for its maintenanceduring good conduct, for the Jesuits held in its entiretythe Pauline dictum that if a man will not work, then neither shall he eat.But as they held it, so they practised it themselves, for their liveswere most laborious -- teaching and preaching, and actingas overseers to the Indians in their labours continually,from the first moment of their arrival at the missions till their death.Thus, if the mayor of the township complained of any man for remissnessat his work, he received no rations till he had improved.--* P. Cardiel, `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 295:  `De estos granos comunales  se da para sembrar', etc.--To inculcate habits of providence amongst the Indians, always inclinedto consume whatever was given to them and go fasting afterwards,they issued the provisions but once a week, and when they killed their oxenforced the Indians to `jerk'* a certain quantity of beefto last throughout the week.  Vegetables each family was obligedto plant both in their gardens and in the common fields;and all that were not actually consumed were dealt out to the workersin the common workshops or preserved for sale.--* This jerked beef is called `charqui' in South America.--Certain of the Indians owned their own cows and horses,and had gardens in which they worked; but all the product was obligedto be disposed of to the Jesuits for the common good, and in exchange for themthey gave knives, scissors, cloth, and looking-glasses, and other articlesmade in the outside world.  Clothes were served out to every Indian,and consisted for the men of trousers, coarse `ponchos',straw hats or caps, and shirts; but neither men nor women ever wore shoes,and the sole costume of the latter was the Guarani `tipoi',*a long and sleeveless shift cut rather high, and with coarse embroideryround the shoulders, and made of a rough cotton cloth.  For ornamentsthey had glass beads and rosaries of brass or silver, with silver rings,and necklaces of glass or horn, from which hung crucifixes.Thus food and clothing cost the Jesuits** (or the community)but little, and a rude plenty was the order of the land.The greatest luxury of the Indians was `mate', and to produce itthey worked in the `yerbales' in the same way in whichthey worked their fields -- in bands and with processions,to the sound of hymns and headed by a priest.--* The poorer classes in Paraguay all used to wear the `tipoi'.  They covered themselves when it was cold with a white cotton sheet  wrapped in many folds.** The Jesuits themselves were dressed in homespun clothes,   for Matias Angles -- quoted in the introduction to   the `Declaracion de la Verdad' of Father Cardiel, published at   Buenos Ayres in 1900 (the introduction by P. Pablo Hernandez) -- says:   `El vestuario de los Padres es de lienzo de algodon ten~ido de negro,   hilado y fabricado por las mismas Indias de los pueblos;   y si tal qual Padre tiene un capote o/ manteo de pan~a de Castilla   se sucede de unos a/ otros, y dura un siglo entero.'--This, then, was the system by means of which the Jesuits succeeded,without employing force of any kind, which in their case would have beenquite impossible, lost as they were amongst the crowd of Indians,in making the Guaranis endure the yoke of toil.  The semi-communalcharacter of their rule accounts for the hostility of Liberals who,like Azara, saw in competition the best road to progress, but who, like him,in their consuming thirst for progress lost sight of happiness.In addition to the means described, the Jesuits had recourseto frequent religious feasts, for which the calendar gave them full scope,so that the life in a Jesuit mission was much diversified and renderedpleasant to the Indians, who have a rooted love of show.  Each mission had,of course, its patron saint,*1* and on his day nobody worked,whilst all was joyfulness and simple mirth.  At break of daya discharge of rockets and of firearms and peals upon the bellsannounced the joyful morn.  Then the whole population flocked to churchto listen to an early mass.  Those who could find no room inside the churchstood in long lines outside the door, which remained open during the ceremony.Mass over, each one ran to prepare himself for his part in the function,the Jesuits having taken care, by multiplying offices and employments,to leave no man without a direct share in all the others did.*2*The humblest and the highest had their part, and the heaviest burden,no doubt, fell upon the two Jesuits,*3* who were answerable for all.The foremost duty was to get the procession ready for the march,and saddle `los caballos del santo'*4* to serve as escort, mounted by Indiansin rich dresses, kept specially for feasts.--*1* In the `Relacion de Misiones' of the Brigadier Don Diego de Alvear,    written between 1788 and 1801, and preserved in    the `Coleccion de Angelis', occurs the following curious description    of the feast-day of a patron saint of a Jesuit reduction:  `They make    a long alley of interwoven canes, which ends in a triumphal arch,    which they adorn with branches of palms and other trees    with considerable grace and taste (`con bastante gracia y simetria').    Under the arch they hang their images of saints, their clothes,    their first-fruits -- as corn and sugar-cane, and calabashes    full of maize-beer (`chicha') -- their meat and bread,    together with animals both alive and dead, such as they can procure    (`como los pueden haber con su diligencia').  Then, forming in a ring,    they dance and shout, `Viva el rey!  Viva el santo tutelar!'*2* Many and curious are the names by which the office-bearers went.    Thus, in the Mission of el Santo Corazon, in the Chiquitos,    I find the following:  Corregidor, the Mayor; Teniente, Lieutenant;    Alferez, Sub-Lieutenant; Alcalde Primero, Head Alcalde;    Alcalde Segundo, Second Alcalde; Commandante, Captain (of the Militia);    Justicia Mayor, Chief Justice; Sargento Mayor, Sergeant-Major.    Then came fiscales, fiscals; sacristan mayor, head-beadle;    capitan de estancia, chief of the cattle farm; capitan de pinturas,    carpinteria, herreros, etc. -- captain of painters, carpenters,    smiths, etc.  All the offices were competed for ardently,    and those of Corregidor and Alcalde in especial were prized so highly    that Indians who were degraded from them for bad conduct or carelessness    not infrequently died of grief.*3* In each reduction there were two priests.  In all Paraguay,    at the expulsion of the Order in 1767, there were only    seventy-eight Jesuits (Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia    del Paraguay', etc., cap. i., vol. ii.).*4* In the mission of Los Apostoles there were 599 of these    `horses of the saint', according to an inventory preserved by Brabo.--The inventory of the town of Los Apostoles*1* enables us to reconstruct,with some attempt at accuracy, how the procession was formedand how it took its way.  All the militia of the town were in attendance,mounted on their best horses, and armed with lances (`chuzos'), lazo, bolas,and a few with guns.  The officers of the Indians rode at their head,dressed out in gorgeous clothes, and troops of dancers, at stated intervals,performed a sort of Pyrrhic dance between the squadrons of the cavalry.*2*In the front of all rode on a white horse the Alferez Real,*3*dressed in a doublet of blue velvet richly laced with gold,a waistcoat of brocade, and with short velvet breechesgartered with silver lace; upon his feet shoes decked with silver buckles,and the whole scheme completed by a gold-laced hat.  In his right hand he heldthe royal standard fastened to a long cane which ended in a silver knob.A sword was by his side, which, as he only could have worn iton such occasions, and as the `horses of the saint' were not unlikelyas ticklish as most horses of the prairies of Entre Rios and Corrientesare wont to be, must have embarrassed him considerably.Behind him came the Corregidor, arrayed in yellow satin,with a silk waistcoat and gold buttons, breeches of yellow velvet,and a hat equal in magnificence to that worn by his bold compeer.The two Alcaldes, less violently dressed, wore straw-coloured silk suits,with satin waistcoats of the same colour, and hats turned up with gold.Other officials, as the Commissario, Maestre de Campo,and the Sargento Mayor, were quite as gaily dressed in scarlet coats,with crimson damask waistcoats trimmed with silver lace,*4* red breeches,and black hats adorned with heavy lace.  In the bright Paraguayan sunshine,with the primeval forest for a background, or in some missionin the midst of a vast plain beside the Parana, they must have lookedas gorgeous as a flight of parrots from the neighbouring woods,and have made a Turneresque effect, ambling along, a blaze of colours,quite as self-satisfied in their finery as if `the rainbow had been entailsettled on them and their heirs male.'  Quite probably their broad,flat noses, and their long, lank hair, their faces fixed immovably,as if they were carved in nandubay, contrasted strangely with their finery.But there were none to judge -- no one to make remarks; most likelyall was conscience and tender heart, and not their bitterest enemyhas laid the charge of humour to the Jesuits' account.--*1* Furnished to Bucareli, Viceroy of Buenos Ayres at the expulsion,    and first printed by Brabo (`Inventarios de los bienes hallados    a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas').*2* The Jesuits exercised the Indians a great deal in dancing,    taking advantage of their love of dancing in their savage state.    D'Orbigny and Demersay (`Fragment d'un Voyage au Centre    de l'Ame/rique Me/ridianale', and `Histoire Physique, etc.,    du Paraguay') found between the years 1830 and 1855    that the Indians of the Moxos and Chiquitos still danced as they had done    in the time of the Jesuits.    I have seen them in the then (1873) almost deserted mission of Jesus,    buried in the great woods on the shore of the Parana,    dance a strange, half-savage dance outside the ruined church.*3* Cardiel, in his `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 239, says:    `Todos los pueblos ponen su castillo en la plaza y en el medio    de el colocan el retratro del Rey, y el Indio Alferez Real    . . . va al castillo con el Estandarte Real y alli hace su homenage    con otros rendimientos anteel Retratro Real,' saying in Guarani,    `Toicohengatu/ n~ande Mbaru bicha guazu/!  Toicohengatu/ n~ande    Rey marangatu/!  Toicohengatu/ n~ande Rey Fernando Sesto!'    (`Long live our King, the great chief!  Long live our good King!    Long live our King Ferdinand VI.').*4* `Chupas de damasco carmesi con encajes de plata.'--As in the inventories of the thirty towns I find no mentioneither of stockings or of shoes for Indians, with the exceptionof the low shoes and buckles worn by the Alferez Real,it seems the gorgeous costumes ended at the knee, and thatthese popinjays rode barefoot, with, perhaps, large iron Gaucho spursfastened by strips of mare-hide round their ankles, and hanging downbelow their naked feet.  But, not content with the procession of the eldersin parrot guise, there was a parody of parodies in the `cabildo infantil',the band composed of children, who, with the self-same titles as their elders,and in the self-same clothes adjusted to their size, rode close upontheir heels.  Lastly, as Charlevoix tells us, came `des lions et des tigres,mais bien enchaine/s afin qu'ils ne troublerent point la fe^te,'and so the whole procession took its way towards the church.The church, all hung with velvet and brocade, was all ablaze with lights,and fumes of incense (no doubt necessary) almost obscured the nave.Upon the right and left hand of the choir (which, as is usual in Spain,was in the middle of the church) the younger Indianswere seated all in rows, the boys and girls being separated,as was the custom in all the missions of the Jesuits, who, no doubt,were convinced of the advisability of the saying that `entre santa y santo,pared de cal y canto.'*1*  The Indians who had some office,and who wore the clothes*2* I have described, were seated or knelt in rows,and at the outside stood the people of the town dressed in white cotton,their simple clothes, no doubt, forming an effective backgroundto their more parti-coloured brethren kneeling in the front.Throughout the church the men and women were separated,and if a rumour of an incursion of Paulistas was in the air, the Indianscarried arms even in the sacred buildings and at the solemn feasts.Mass was celebrated with a full band, the oboe, fagot, lute, harp,cornet, clarinet, violin, viola, and all other kinds of music,figuring in the inventories of the thirty towns.  Indeed,in two of the inventories*3* an opera called `Santiago' is mentioned,which had special costumes and properties to put it on the stage.Mass over, the procession was reconstituted outside the church,and after parading once more through the town broke up,and the Indians devoted the night to feasting, and not infrequentlydanced till break of day.--*1* It may be roughly translated, `a good stone wall between    a male and female saint.'*2* These clothes were the property of the community,    and not of the individual Indians.*3* Brabo, xxxv., Introduction to `Los inventarios de los bienes.'--Such were the outward arts with which the Jesuits soughtto attach the simple people, to whom they stood in the positionnot only of pastors and masters both in one, but alsoas protectors from the Paulistas on one side, and on the otherfrom the Spaniards of the settlements, who, with their `encomiendas'and their European system of free competition between man and man,were perhaps unknowingly the direst enemies of the whole Indian race.There is, as it would seem, implanted in the minds of almost allprimitive peoples, such as the Guaranis, a solidarity,a clinging kinship, which if once broken down by competition,unrestrained after our modern fashion, inevitably leads to their decay.Hence the keen hatred to the Chinese in California and in Australia.Naturally, those whom we hate, and in a measure fear, we also vilify,and this has given rise to all those accusations of Oriental vice(as if the vice of any Oriental, however much depraved, was comparableto that of citizens of Paris or of London), of barbarism, and the like,so freely levelled against the unfortunate Chinese.In Paraguay nothing is more remarkable in a market in the countrythan the way in which the people will not undersell each other,even refusing to part with goods a fraction lower than the pricewhich they consider fair.*  It may be that the Jesuits would have done betterto endeavour to equip their neophytes more fully, so as to take their placein the battle of the world.  It may be that the simple, happy lives they ledwere too opposed to the general scheme of outside human lifeto find acceptance or a place in our cosmogony.  But one thingI am sure of -- that the innocent delight of the poor Indian Alferez Real,mounted upon his horse, dressed in his motley, barefooted,and overshadowed by his gold-laced hat, was as entire as ifhe had eaten of all the fruits of all the trees of knowledge of his time,and so perhaps the Jesuits were wise.--* A recent writer in the little journal published on yellow packing-paper  in the Socialist colony of Cosme, in Paraguay (`Cosme Monthly',  November, 1898), has a curious passage corroborating what I have so often  observed myself.  Under the heading of `A Paraguayan Market',  he says:  `The Guarani clings stubbornly to the Guarani customs.  This is irritating to the European, but who shall say  that the Guarani is not right? . . .  European settlement  cannot but be fatal to the Guarani, however profitable it may be  to land-owning and mercantile classes. . . .  The Paraguayan market  is a woman's club . . . they will come thirty or forty miles  with a clothful of the white curd-cheese of the country,  contentedly journeying on foot along the narrow paths.  They will cut a cabbage into sixteenths and eat their cheese themselves  rather than sell it under market price.'  Long may they do so,  for so long will they be free, and perhaps poor; but, then,  in countries such as Paraguay freedom and poverty are identical.--Strangely enough -- but, then, how strangely all extremes meet in humanity! --the Jesuits alone (at least, in Paraguay) seem to have apprehended,as the Arabs certainly have done from immemorial time,that the first duty of a man is to enjoy his life.  Art, science,literature, ambition -- all the frivolities with which menoccupy themselves -- have their due place; but life is first,and in some strange, mysterious way the Jesuits felt it, though, no doubt,they would have been the first to deny it with a thousand oaths.But in a Jesuit mission all was not feasting or processioning,for with such neighbours as the Mamelucos they had tokeep themselves prepared.*1*  As for their better government in home affairseach mission had its police, with officers*2* chosen by the Jesuitsamongst the Indians, so for exterior defence they had militia,and in it the `caciques'*3* of the different tribes held principal command.Most likely over them, or at their elbows, were set priestswho before entering the Company of Jesus had been soldiers:for there were many such amongst the Jesuits.  As their own founderonce had been a soldier, so the Company was popular amongst those soldierswho from some cause or other had changed their swords to crucifixes,and taken service in the ranks of Christ.*4*  As it was most important,both for defence and policy, to keep the `caciques' content,they were distinguished by better treatment than the othersin many different ways.  Their food was more abundant, and a guard of Indianswas on perpetual duty round the houses where they lived; these they employedas servants and as messengers to summon distant companies of Indiansto the field.  Their method of organization must have beenlike that of the Boers or of the Arabs; for every Indianbelonged to a company, which now and then was brought togetherfor evolutions in the field or for a period of training,after the fashion of our militia or the German Landwehr.Perhaps this system of an armed militia, always ready for the field,was what, above all other reasons, enabled their detractorsto represent the Jesuits as feared and unpopular.  Why, it was asked,does this community of priests maintain an army in its territories?No one remembered that if such were not the case the missionscould not have existed for a year without a force to defend their bordersfrom the Paulistas.  Everyone forgot that Fathers Montoya and Del Tanohad obtained special permission from the King for the Indians of the missionsto bear arms; and, as no human being is grateful for anythingbut contumelious treatment, the Spanish settlers conveniently forgothow many times a Jesuit army had saved their territories.The body of three thousand Guaranis sent at the expense of the Companyto assist the Spaniards against the Portuguese at the attack uponthe Colonia del Sacramento*5* on the river Plate, in 1678,was quite forgotten, together with the innumerable contingentssent by the Jesuits at the demand of Spanish governors againstthe Chaco Indians, the Payaguas, and even against the distant Calchaquis,in what is now the province of Jujuy.  Even when an English pirate,called in the Spanish histories Roque Barloque (explained by some to beplain Richard Barlow), appeared off Buenos Ayres, the undaunted neophytesshrank not a moment from going to the assistance of their co-religionistsagainst the `Lutheran dog'.*6*  Lastly, all Spanish governors and writers,both contemporaneous and at the end of the eighteenth century, seem to forgetthat if the Jesuits had an army of neophytes within their territorythe fact was known and approved of at the court of Spain.*7*  But it appearsthat Calvin had many coadjutors in his policy of `Jesuitas aut necandiaut calumniis opponendi sunt.'*8*  When a Jesuit army took the field,driving before it sufficient cattle to subsist upon, and withits `caballada' of spare horses upon its flank, it must have resembledmany a Gaucho army I have seen in Entre Rios five-and-twenty years ago.The only difference seems to have been that the Gauchos of yesterdaydid not use bows and arrows, although they might have done sowith as much benefit to themselves, and no more danger to their enemies,than was occasioned by the rusty, ill-conditioned guns they used to bear.The Indians were armed with bows, and in their expeditionseach Indian carried one hundred and fifty arrows tipped with iron.Others had firearms, but all bore bolas on their saddles,and carried lazos and long lances,*9* which, like the Pampa Indians,they used in mounting their horses, placing one hand upon the mane,and vaulting into the saddles with the other leaning on the lance.The infantry were armed with lances and a few guns; they also carried bolas,but they trusted most to slings, for which they carried bags of hide,with a provision of smooth round stones, and used them dexterously.On several occasions their rude militia gave proofs of stubborn valour,and, as they fought under the Jesuits' eyes, no doubt acquitted themselvesas men would who looked upon their priests almost in the light of gods.But agriculture and cattle-breeding were not all the resourcesof the missions; for the Jesuits engaged in commerce largely,both with the outer world and by the intricate and curious barter systemwhich they had set on foot for the mutual convenience of the differentmission towns.  In many of the inventories printed by Brabo,one comes across the entry `Deudas', showing a sort of account currentbetween the towns for various articles.  Thus, they exchangedcattle for cotton, sugar for rice, wheat for pig-iron or tools from Europe;as no account of interest ever appears in any inventoryas between town and town, it seems the Jesuits anticipated Socialism --at least, so far as that they bought and sold for use, and not for gain.Although between the towns of their own territory all was arrangedfor mutual convenience, yet in their dealings with the outside worldthe Jesuits adhered to what are known as `business principles'.These principles, if I mistake not, have been deified by politicianswith their `Buy in the cheapest, sell in the dearest' tag, and thereforeeven the sternest Protestant or Jansenist (if such there still exist)can have no stone to throw at the Company of Jesus for its participationin that system which has made the whole world glad.--*1* As the Gaucho proverb says, `Las armas son necesarias    pero "naide" sabe cuando.'*2* Corregidores, alcaldes, regidores, alguaciles, etc.*3* Hereditary or sometimes elected chiefs.*4* I remember seeing on the tombstone of a Spanish sailor    his hope of salvation through the intercession of    the Lord High Admiral Christ.  After the Spanish custom,    officers were often generals both by sea and land, so that soldiers    were not excluded from the Lord High Admiral's intercession.*5* Dean Funes (`Ensayo de la Historia de Paraguay', etc.) says:    `These Indians went under the command of Don Antonio de Vera Moxica;    their sergeants were Guaranis and their captains Spaniards.    Their `cacique' was Ignacio Amandaa, who commanded in chief    under Vera Moxica.'  They fought bravely, and returned    again and again to the assault of the town after several repulses,    manifesting the same dogged courage and indifference to death    which their descendants showed in the war against Brazil in 1866-70.    In that war bodies of Paraguayans frequently attacked strong positions    defended by artillery, and allowed themselves to be shot down    to the last man rather than retire.  At other times, concealed behind    masses of floating herbage, from their canoes they sprang on board    Brazilian ironclads, and were all killed in the vain endeavour    to capture the vessels.  I knew a little pettifogging lawyer,    one Izquierdo, who, with ten companions, attempted in a canoe    to take the Brazilian flagship (an ironclad); left alone on her deck,    after the death of his companions, he sprang into the water    under a shower of bullets, and, badly wounded, swam over to the Chaco,    the desert side of the river.  There for three days he remained,    subsisting on wild oranges, and then swam across again    on a raft of sticks, in spite of the alligators and many fierce fish    which abound in Paraguay.  He got well, and, though lame,    was, when I knew him, as arrant a little scrivening knave    as you could hope to meet in either hemisphere.    On many other occasions the mission Indians performed notable services for    the Spanish Government.  In 1681, when the French attacked Buenos Ayres,    a detachment of two thousand Indians was sent to its assistance.    Philip V. himself wrote to the Provincial of Paraguay on this occasion    asking him to send troops to the defence of the city.    In 1785 four thousand Guaranis, commanded by Don Baltazar Garcia,    were at the second siege of the Colonia del Sacramento.    Funes says of them:  `A juicio de un testigo ocular,    no es menos admirable la sangre fria de sus capellanes.'*6* `Perro Luterano'.  It is astonishing how in Spain    the comparatively innocuous Luther has fallen heir    to the heritage of hatred that should more properly have belonged    to the inhuman and treacherous Calvin.*7* Philip V. in 1745, after an examination which lasted six years,    approved of all the actions of the Jesuits in Paraguay    (Cretineau Joly, `Histoire de la Compagnie de Je/sus', vol. v., p. 103).    So that a curious letter of a Jeronimite friar (one Padre Cevallos),    written in 1774, is well within due limits when it says    that all the Jesuits did in Paraguay was `todo probado    por reales cedulas o/ procedia de ordenes expresas.'*8* One is obliged to allow, in common fairness, that Calvin carried out    in his own practice what he advocated -- as witness his conduct    with Servetus, whom he first calumniated, then entrapped,    and lastly murdered in cold blood.*9* Don Francisco Corr sent the following list of arms to the Viceroy Zabala,    of Buenos Ayres (Funes, `Ensayo', etc.):  `Armas buenas, 850;    lanzas de hierro, 3,850; pedreras (culverins), 10.  Las flechas    no se cuentan.'  He says:  `Todos los Indios quando han de salir    a compan~a llevan 150 flechas de hierro, menos los que llevan    armos de fuego.  Asi mismo cargan "bolas" que son dos piedras    en una cuerda.  Los de a pie que no llevan escopetas tienen lanza, flecha,    y honda con su provision de piedras en un bolson como de granaderos.    Se prestan caballos entre los pueblos.'--Cotton and linen cloth, tobacco, hides, woods of the varioushard-wood forests of the country, and, above all, `yerba-mate',were their chief articles of export to the outside world.Their nearest market was in Buenos Ayres, and to that portthey sent their `yerba' in boats made at their own yards,of which they had several, but notably at Yapeyu upon the Uruguay.The money that was made was sent to the Superior of the missions,who had the disposition of the way in which it was dispensed,either for use at home or to be sent to Europe for necessary goods.As well as `yerba-mate', they sent great quantities of hides.The inventories of the towns taken at the expulsion statethat the number of green hides*1* exported annually was fifty thousand,together with six thousand cured; in addition they soldfrom three to four arrobas*2* of horse-hair, and woodto the value of twenty-five to thirty thousand dollarsevery year.  The total export of their `yerba' ranged betweeneighty and one hundred thousand arrobas, which at the lowest pricecould not have been sold at a profit under seven dollars an arroba,*3*so that the income*4* of the thirty towns must have been relatively large.*5*Two or three hundred barrels of honey*6* and some three or four thousandarrobas of tobacco made up the sum total of their exports,though, had they needed money, it might have been increased in such a country,and with so many willing labourers, almost indefinitely.--*1* Ibanez (`Histoire du Paraguay sous les Je/suites') states    the hides sold at about three dollars apiece.*2* The arroba was twenty-five pounds.*3* These figures are from Brabo's inventories.*4* Ibanez states that only eighty-four dollars a year were set apart    for the maintenance of each priest.*5* Dean Funes (`Ensayo de le Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.)    puts it at a million reales, which almost equals 20,800 Pounds.    Ibanez (`La Republica Jesuitica'), with the noble    disregard of consequences so noticeable in most polemical writers,    boldly alters this to a million dollars, his object being to prove    that the Jesuits exacted exorbitant taxation from the neophytes.*6* The honey of the missions was celebrated, and the wax made    by the small bee called `Opemus', according to Charlevoix    (livre v., p. 285), `e/tait d'une blancheur qui n'avait rien de pareil,    et ces neophytes ont consacre/ tout qu'ils en peuvent avoir    a\ bruler devant les images de la Ste. Vierge.'--Thus it will be seen that the missions were organizedboth agriculturally and commercially so as to be almost self-supporting,and that of the mere necessaries of life they had sufficient for exportation,no small achievement when we consider how averse from labour were the Indianswith whom they had to deal.  But that nothing should be wantingthat a civilized community could possibly desire, they had their prisons,with good store of chains, fetters, whips, and all the other instrumentswith which the moral code is generally enforced.  The most usual punishmentwas whipping;* and the crimes most frequent were drunkenness,neglect of work, and bigamy, which latter lapse from virtuethe Jesuits chastised severely, not thinking, being celibates themselves,that not unlikely it was apt to turn into its own punishmentwithout the aid of stripes.--* In the inventory of the mission of San Jose I find:  `Item, doce pares de grillos'; but I am bound to say that in this instance  they were for the use of `los Guaicurus infieles prisioneros  que estan en dicha mision.'--Chapter VII  Causes of the Jesuits' unpopularity -- Description of the lives and habits  of the priests -- Testimony in favour of the missions --  Their opposition to slavery -- Their system of administrationMuch has been written of the interior government of the missionsby the Jesuits, but chiefly by strong partisans, for and against,on either side, whose only object was to make out a caseto fit the prejudices of those for whom they wrote.  Upon the Jesuit sidethe Abbe Muratori* describes a paradise.  A very Carlo Dolceamongst writers, with him all in the missions is so cloying sweetthat one's soul sickens, and one longs in his `Happy Christianity'to find a drop of gall.  But for five hundred pages nothing is amiss;the men of Belial persecute the Jesuit saints, who always(after the fashion of their Order and mankind) turn both cheeks to the smiter,and, if their purse is taken, hasten to give up their cloaks.The Indians are all love and gratitude.  No need in the Abbe's pagesfor the twelve pair of fetters, which Brabo most unkindly has set downamongst his inventories.  Never a single `lapsus' from the moral rulethe Jesuits imposed -- no drunkenness, and bigamy so seldom met withthat it would seem that Joseph Andrews had been a swaggererjudged by the standard of these moral Guaranis.  Then comes Ibanez,**the ex-Jesuit, on the other side.  In a twinkling of an eyethe scene is changed.  For, quite in Hogarth's vein, he paints the missionsas a perpetual march to Finchley, and tells us that the Indians were savages,and quite unchanged in all their primitive propensities under the Jesuit rule.And for the Jesuits themselves he has a few home-truthsadministered with vinegar, after the fashion of the renegadethe whole world over, who sees nothing good in the societythat has turned him out.  He roundly says the Jesuits were loafers,accuses them of keeping the Indians ignorant for their own purposes,and paints them quite as black as the Abbe Muratori painted themrose colour, and with as little art.  So that, as usually happensin the writings of all polemists, no matter upon which side they may write,but little information, and that distorted to an incredible degree,is all that they afford.--* `Il Cristianesimo Felice nelle Missione dei Padri della Compagnia di Jesu  nel Paraguay'.** `L'Histoire du Paraguay sous les Je/suites', Amsterdam, 1700, lxxv.--In general, curious as it may appear, the bitterest opponents of the Jesuitswere Catholics, and Protestants have often written as apologists.Buffon, Raynal, and Montesquieu, with Voltaire, Robertson, and Southey,have written favourably of the internal government of the missionsand the effect which it produced.  No other names of equal authoritycan be quoted on the other side; but yet the fact remainsthat the Jesuits in Paraguay were exposed to constant calumnyfrom the first day they went there till the last member of the Orderleft the land.It is my object first to try to show what the conditions of their governmentreally were, and then to try and clear up what was the cause of unpopularity,and why so many and such persistent calumnies were laid to their account.Stretching right up and down the banks of both the Parana and Uruguay,the missions extended from Nuestra Senora de Fe* (or Santa Maria),in Paraguay, to San Miguel, in what is now the Brazilian provinceof Rio Grande do Sul; and from the mission of Corpus,on the east bank of the Parana, to Yapeyu, upon the Uruguay.The official capital was placed at Candelaria, on the east bankof the Parana.  In that town the Superior of the missionshad his official residence, and from thence he ruled the whole territory,having not only the ecclesiastical but the temporal power,the latter, from the position in which he was placed, so many hundred milesfrom any Spanish Governor, having by degrees gradually come into his hands.The little town of La Candelaria was, when I knew it,in a most neglected state.  The buildings of the Jesuits,with the exception of the church, were all in ruins.The streets were sandy and deserted, the foot-walk separated from themby a line of hard-wood posts, which, as tradition said,were left there by the Jesuits; but the hard woods of Paraguayare almost as imperishable as iron.--* In all, the missions amounted to thirty; and for their relative situations  vide the curious map [not available in this ASCII text],  the original of which was published in the work of Padre Pedro Lozano,  C. de J., `Descripcion chorographica del terreno, rios, arboles y animales  de las dilatadissimas provincias del Gran Chaco, Gualanba', etc.  Cordoba, del Tucuman, en el Colegio de la Assumpcion,  por Joseph Santos Balbas, 1733.--A `balsa' -- that is, a flying bridge worked by a cable --plied fitfully across the Parana to Ytapua, also a little ex-Jesuit townupon the other side.  Each shop had a sign outside, as was the case in Englanda hundred years ago.  Indians supplied the place with vegetables,floating down in canoes piled up with fruit, with flowers,with sweet potatoes, and returning home empty, or for their cargothree or four tin pails, a looking-glass, or other of the marvelswhich Europe sends as a sample of her manufactures to little frontier towns.All was as quiet, or perhaps much quieter than in the time whenthe Superior of the Jesuits was in residence, and if it had been necessary,during the hot hours of noon, Godivas by the dozen might have riddendown the streets, had they been able to find horses quiet enough to ride,certain that no one in the town would lose his after-breakfast napto look at them.In every mission two chosen Jesuits lived.  The elder, selected forhis experience of the country and knowledge of the tongue from amongst thosewho had been rectors of colleges or provincials of the Order,was vested with the civil power, and was responsible direct to the Superior.The second, generally styled companion (el Companero),acted as his lieutenant, and had full charge of all things spiritual;so that they were a check on one another, and their duties did not clash.In difficulties the Superior transmitted orders, like a general in the field,by mounted messengers, who frequently rode over a hundred miles a day,relays of horses always being kept ready for emergenciesevery three leagues upon the road.From La Candelaria roads branched off to every portion of the territory,most of them fit for carts, and all superior to those tracks which werethe only thoroughfares but twenty years ago.  Roads ran to Corrientes,to Asuncion, others from Yapeyu to the Salto Grande, on the Parana.Upon the Upper Uruguay were about eighty posts, all guarded,and with horses ready to equip the messengers.  But there were also roadsin the district of the Upper Parana, which I myself rememberas a wilderness, uncrossed, uncrossable, where tigers roamed aboutand Indians shot at the rare traveller with poisoned arrowsout of a blow-pipe, whilst they remained unseen in the recesses of the woods.In the districts of the Upper Uruguay and Parana, besides the roadsand relays of post-horses, they had a fleet both of canoes and boatsin which they carried `yerba'* and the other products of the land.Thus, with their fleet of boats and of canoes, their highroads branching outon every side, and their relays of post-horses at intervals, most probablyno State of America at the time had such interior means of communicationwith the seat of government.  The Incas and the Aztecs certainly had postswho carried messages and brought up fish from the coast with great rapidity;but all the Spanish colonies contemporaneous with the Jesuits' settlementsin Paraguay had fallen into a state of lethargy and of interior decay.The roads the Incas used in Peru were falling fast into disuse,and it took several weeks to send a letter from Buenos Ayresto the Pacific coast.--* A letter of a certain Jesuit (name lost, but dated 1715) says that  there were at least two thousand canoes in constant use on the Parana,  and almost as many more on the Uruguay (Brabo, `Inventarios', etc.).--The system of interior government in the missions was in appearance democratic-- that is to say, there were officials, as mayors*1* and councillors;but most of them were named by the Jesuits, and all of them,even although elected, owed their election entirely to their priests.This sort of thought-suggested representation was the most fittingfor the Indians at the time,*2* and those who look intothe workings of a County Council of to-day cannot but think at timesthat the majority of the councillors would have been better chosenhad the electorate had the benefit of some controlling hand,though from what quarter it is difficult to see.  The problemwhich most writers on the Jesuits have quite misunderstood,is how two Jesuits were able to keep a mission of several thousand Indiansin order, and to rule supreme without armed forces, or any meansof making their power felt or of enforcing obedience to their decrees.Undoubtedly, the dangerous position in which the Indians stood,exposed on one side to the Paulistas, and on the otherto the Spanish settlers, both of whom wished to take them as their slaves,placed power in the Jesuits' hands:  for the Indians clearly perceivedthat the Jesuits alone stood between them and instant slavery.Most controversialists who have opposed the Jesuits assertthat the Indians of the missions were, in reality, half slaves.Nothing is further from the truth, if one consults the contemporary records,and remembers the small number of the Jesuits.  The work the Indians didwas inconsiderable, and under such conditions as to deprive itof much of the toilsomeness which is incident to any kind of work.The very essence of a slave's estate is being obliged to workwithout remuneration for another man.  Nothing was farther from the Indiansthan such a state of things.  Their work was done for the community,and though the Jesuits, without doubt, had the full dispositionof all the money earned in commerce,*3* and of the distribution of the goods,neither the money nor the goods were used for self-aggrandisement,but were laid out for the benefit of the community at large.The total population of the thirty towns is variously estimatedfrom one hundred and forty to one hundred and eighty thousand,*4*and, curiously enough, it remained almost at the same figureduring the whole period of the Jesuit rule.  This fact has been adducedagainst the Jesuits, and it has been said that they could not have beengood rulers, or the population must have increased; but those who say soforget that the Indians of Paraguay were never in great numbers,and that most writers on the wild tribes, as Dobrizhoffer*5* and Azara,remark their tendency never to increase.--*1* Corregidores, regidores, alcaldes, etc.*2* It is not to be supposed, however, that the Indians were kept    in ignorance.  P. Cardiel (`Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 222),    quoting from the Cedula Real of 1743, says that `in every one of the towns    there is a school established to teach reading and writing in Spanish,    and that on that account a great number of Indians are to be met    who write well.'  Cardiel adds, on the same page, `Dos de ellos    estan copiando ahora esto que yo escribo, y de mejor letra que la mia.'*3* Dean Funes (`Ensayo Critico', etc.) puts the income from commerce    of the thirty towns at a hundred thousand dollars, and informs us that,    after taxation (to the Crown) had been deducted from it, it was applied    to the maintenance of the churches and other necessary expenses,    and by the end of the year little of it remained.*4* Don Martin de Barua, in his memorial to the King (1736),    complaining of the Jesuits, puts the number of taxable Indians    at forty thousand.  The Commission appointed to examine into the charges    in 1736, which reported in 1745 (a reasonable interval),    affirmed that the taxable Indians only numbered 19,116.    Each Indian paid an annual poll-tax of one dollar a year to the Crown.    In addition to that, every town gave one hundred dollars a year.    The salary of the priests was six hundred dollars a year    (Azara, `Voyage dans l'Ame/rique Me/ridionale').*5* `Account of the Abipones'.  London:  John Murray, 1822.--All this relatively large population of Indians was ruled,as has been seen, by a quite inconsiderable number of priests,who, not disposing of any European force, and being almost always on bad termswith the Spanish settlers in Paraguay on account of the firm stand they madeagainst the enslaving of the Indians, had no means of coercionat their command.  Hence the Indians must have been contented with their rule,for if they had not been so the Jesuits possessed no power to stop themfrom returning to their savage life.  Azara,*1* although in the mainan opponent of the Jesuits, in the same way that a `good Liberal' of to-daywould oppose anything of a Socialistic tendency, yet hasthis most significant passage in their favour.  After enumeratingthe amount of taxes paid by the missions to the Crown, he says `en faisantle bilan tout se trouvait e/gal, et s'il y avait quelque exce/dant,il e/tait en faveur des Je/suites ou des peoplades.'*2*  Seldom enoughdoes such a result take place when the balance is struck to-day in any countrybetween the rulers and their `taxables'.  Following their systemof perfect isolation from the world to its logical sequence,the Jesuits surrounded all the territories of their different townswith walls and ditches, and at the gates planted a guard to preventegress or ingress between the missions and the outer world.*3*Much capital has been made out of this, as it is attempted to be shownthat the Indians were thereby treated as prisoners in their own territories.Nothing, however, has been said of the fact that, if the ditches, palisades,and guard-houses kept in the Indians, they also had the effect of keepingthe Spaniards out.  When men who looked upon the Indians as without reason,and captured them for slaves when it was possible, began to talk of liberty,it looks as if the `sacred name of liberty' was used but as a stalking-horse-- as greasy Testaments are used to swear upon in police-courts,when the witness, with his tongue in his cheek, raises his eyes to heaven,and then with fervency imprints a kiss upon his thumb.--*1* `Voyage dans l'Ame/rique Me/ridionale'.  Paris:  Denton, 1809.*2* Pera/mas (`De vita et moribus sex sacerdotum Paraguaycorum,    Petrus Joanes Andrea', lxxxiv.) states that it appeared, from papers left    after their expulsion, that the income of the Jesuit College of Cordoba    just paid the expenses of administration (`era con escasa diferencia    igual a/ los gastos').    In the Archivo General of Buenos Ayres, legajo `Compan~ia de Jesu/s',    there is a document referred to by P. Hernandez in his introduction    to the work of P. Cardiel (`Declaracion de la Verdad'), which states    that in the year of the expulsion the income of the thirty towns    fell a little short of the expenses.*3* Azara, `Voyage dans l'Ame/rique Me/ridionale'; also Funes,    `Ensayo Critico de la Historia del Paraguay'; and Padre Guevara,    `Historia del Paraguay, Rio de la Plata y Tucuman'.--It will be seen that the communism of the missions was of a limited character,and, though the land was cultivated by the labour of the community,that the products were administered by the Jesuits alone.  Though ithas been stated by many polemical writers, such as Ibanez and Azara,and more recently by Washburne, who was American Minister in Paraguayduring the war with Brazil and the Argentine Republic (1866-70),that the Jesuits had amassed great wealth in Paraguay, no proof has ever beenadvanced for such a charge.  Certainly Cardenas made the same statement,but it was never in his power to bring any confirmation of what he said.This power alone was in the hands of Bucareli (1767),the Viceroy of Buenos Ayres, under whose auspices the expulsion of the Jesuitswas carried out.  By several extracts from Brabo's inventories,and by the statement of the receivers sent by Bucareli, I hope to showthat there was no great wealth at any time in the mission territory,and that the income was expended in the territory itself.It may be that the expenditure on churches was excessive,and also that the money laid out on religious ceremonies was not productive;but the Jesuits, strange as it may appear, did not conduct the missionsafter the fashion of a business concern, but rather asthe rulers of some Utopia -- those foolish beings who think happinessis preferable to wealth.Nothing can give a better idea of the way of life of a Jesuit priestand of his daily labours than the curious letter of Nicolas Neenguiru,originally written in Guarani, but of which a translation is extantin the National Spanish Archives in Simancas:*--* Archivo General de Simancas, Estado, legajo 7,450, folios 21 y 22, 5a,  Copia de las cartas (sin firma; la siguiente es de Nicolas Neenguiru/)  que se hallaron en letra Guarani/ traducidas por los interpreteo nombrados  en las sorpresa hecha al pueblo de San Lorenzo por el Coronel  D. Jose Joaquin de Viana, Gobernador de Montevideo,  el dia 20 de Mayo de 1756:  `El modo de vivir del Padre es, cerrar bien todas las puertas y quedarse  el solo, su Mayordomo, y su muchacho.  Son ya Indios de edad,  y solo estos asisten solo de dia adentro, y a/ las doce salen afuera,  y un viejo es quien cuida de la Porteria, y es quien Sierra la puerta  quando descansa el Padre, o/ quando sale el Padre a/ ver su chacara.  Y aun entonces van solos, sino es con un Indio de hedad quien  los giua y cuida de el caballo y despues de esto a/ misa y a/ la tarde  al Rosario de Maria Santisima llamandonos con toque de campana,  y antes de esto a/ los muchachos y muchachittas los llama  con una campa/nilla y despues de eso el bueno de el Padre  entra ha ensen~arles la Doctrina, y el persinarse de el mismo modo,  todos los dias de fiesta nos Predica la palabra de Dios,  del mismo modo el Santo Sacramento de la Penitencia y de la Communion,  en estas cosas se exercitta el bueno del Padre y todas las noches se sierra  la porteria y la llave se lleva al aposento del Padre y solo se vuelve  a/ abrir por la man~ana quando entra el Sachristan y los cosineros. . . .  `Los Padres todas las man~anas nos dicen misas, y despues de misa,  se van a su aposento y hai cogen un poco de aqua caliente  con Yerva y no otra cosa mas; despues de esto sale a la puerta  de su aposento y ahai todos los que oyeron misa se arrimen  a besarle la mano, y despues de esto sale afuera a ver los Indios  si trabajan en los oficios que cada uno tiene, y despues se van  a su aposento a resar el oficio divino, en su libro, y para que Dios  le ayude en todas sus cosas.  A las once de el dia van a comer un poquitto,  no a/ comer mucho solo coge cinco plattitos y solo beve una vez el vino,  no llenando un vaso pequen~o, y aguardiente nunca lo toman y el vino  no lo hai en nuestro pueblo, solo lo traen de la Candelaria  segun lo que envia el Padre Superior lo trahen de acia Buenos Aires. . . .  Despues que sale de comer y para descansar an poco, y mientras descansa  salen fuera los que assisten en la casa del Padre, y los que trabajan dentro  en algunas obras y tamvien el Sachristan y el cosinero:  todos estos salen fuera y quando no se toca la campana estan  serradas las puertas, y solo un viejo es el que cuida de las puertas,  y quando vuelvan a tocar la campana, vuelve este a abrirlas  para que vuelvan a entrar los que trabajan dentro,  y el Padre Coge el Brebiario no a ir a parte ninguna.  A la tarde tocan la campanilla paraque se recojan las criatturas,  y entre el Padre a/ ensenarles la doctrina christiana.'--`The manner of living of the father is to shut all the doors, and remain alonewith his servant and his cook (who are Indians of a considerable age),and these only wait on him; but by day only, and at twelve o'clock,they go out, and an old man has care of the porter's lodge,and it is he who shuts the gate when the father is asleep,or when he goes out to see his cultivated ground, and even then they go alone,except it be with an old Indian, who guides them and attends tothe (father's) horse; and after that he goes to Mass,and in the evening to the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin,calling us together by the sound of the bell, and before thathe calls the boys and girls with a small bell, and after thatthe good father begins to teach them doctrine and how to cross themselves.In the same way, on every feast day, he preaches to us the Word of God,in the same way the Holy Sacrament of Penitence and of the Communion;in these things does the good Father employ himself, and every nightthe porter's lodge is closed, and the key taken to the Father's room,which is only opened in the morning in order that the sacristan and the cooksmay enter. . . .`The Fathers every morning say Mass for us, and after Mass they goto their rooms, and then they take some hot water and `yerba' (`mate'),and nothing more; after that he comes to the door of his apartment,and then all those who heard Mass come to kiss his hand,and after that he goes out to see if the Indians are diligent at their tasks,and afterwards they go to their room to read the divine service for the dayin his book, and to pray that God may prosper him in all his affairs.At eleven o'clock they go to eat a little, not to eat much, for he only hasfive dishes, and only drinks wine once, not filling a little glass;and spirits they never drink, and there is no wine in our town,except that which is brought from Candelaria, according to thatwhich the Superior sends, and they bring it from somewherenear Buenos Aires. . . .  After he has finished eating, to rest a littlehe goes into the church; afterwards -- yes, he retires to rest a little,and whilst he is resting those who work in the father's house go out,and those who do any kind of indoor work, and also the sacristan and the cook:all these go out, and as long as the bell does not ring the doors are shut,and only an old man guards the gate, and when they ring the bell againhe opens the doors so that those who work indoors may go inside,and the father takes his breviary and goes nowhere.  In the eveningthey ring the bell so that the children may come home, and the father comes into teach them Christian doctrine.'Perhaps the foregoing simple description, written by an Indian in Guarani,and translated by someone who has preserved in Spanishall the curious inversions of the Guarani, presents as gooda picture of the daily life of a mission priest in Paraguayas any that has ever been given to the public by writers much more ambitiousthan myself or Neenguiru.  Nicolas Neenguiru, the writer of the letter,afterwards figured in the war against the Portuguese,and several of his letters are preserved in the archives of Simancas,though none so interesting and simple as that I have transcribed.Dobrizhoffer, in his history of the Abipones, says of him that he wasa simple Indian, whom often he had seen put in the stocks for petty faults;at any rate, he seems to have been one of those Indians whom the Jesuitshad at least favourably impressed by the system they employed.After the manner in which he wrote, hundreds of Indians must have thought,or else the missions, placed as they were, surrounded on all sides by enemies,could not have endured a single day.  What was it, then,which raised the Jesuits up so many and so powerful enemies in Paraguay,when in the districts of the Moxos* and the Chiquitoswhere their power was to the full as great, amongst the Indians,they never had a quarrel with the Spaniards till the day they were expelled?Many and various causes contributed to all they underwent,but most undoubtedly two reasons must have brought about their fall.--* Perhaps the entire isolation of the Jesuits in these two provinces  accounts for their absolute quiet; and if this is so, it goes far to prove  that they were right to attempt the same isolation in Paraguay.  The comparative nearness of the Spanish settlements  frustrated their attempts in this instance.--Since the time of Cardenas, the report that the Jesuits had rich mines,which they worked on the sly, had been persistently on the increase.Although disproved a thousand times, it still remained; even to-day,in spite of `science' and its wonderful discoveries, there are manyin Paraguay who cherish dreams of discovering Jesuit mines.  Humanity lovesto deceive itself, although there are plenty ready to deceive it;and if men can both forge for themselves fables and at the same timedamage their neighbours in so doing, their pleasure is intense.I take it that many really believed the stories of the mines,being unable to credit that anyone would live far from the world,surrounded but by Indians, for any other reason than to be rich.But let a country have rich minerals, even if they exist but in imagination,and it becomes a crime against humanity to shut it up.  So thatit would appear one of the reasons which induced hatred against the Jesuitswas the idea that they had enormous mineral wealth, which eitherthey did not work or else worked in secret for the benefit of their society.The other reason was the question of slavery.  Once get it well into your headthat you and yours are `reasoning men'* (`gente de razon'),and that all coloured people are irrational, and slavery followsas a natural sequence; for `reasoning men' have wit to make a gun,and on the gun all reason takes it stand.  From the first instantof their arrival in America, the Jesuits had maintained a firm frontagainst the enslavement of the Indians.  They may have had their faultsin Europe, and in the larger centres of population in America;but where they came in contact with the Indians, theirs was the sole voiceraised upon their side.--* For `reasoning men', and how this monstrous superstition  still prevails in Venezuela, see the charming book of S. Perez Triana,  `De Bogota al Atlantico', etc., pp. 156-158 (Paris:  Impresa Sud Americana).  A really interesting book of travels, without cant, and without an eye  on the public.  Strange to relate, the author seems to have killed nothing  during his journey.--In 1593 Padre Juan Romero, sent from Peru as Superior to Paraguay,on his arrival gave up an estate (with Indians in `encomienda')which his predecessors had enjoyed, alleging that he did not wishto give the example of making profit out of the unpaid labour of the Indians,*and that without their work the estate was valueless.--* Charlevoix, book iv.--On many occasions, notably in the time of Cardenas, the Jesuitsopenly withstood all slavery, and amongst the concessionsthat Ruiz Montoya obtained from the King of Spain was one declaringall the Indians to be free.*1*  If more examples of the hatredthat their attitude on slavery called forth were wanting,it is to be remembered that in 1640, when Montoya and Tanoreturned from Spain, and affixed the edict of the Pope on the church doorsin Piritinanga, threatening with excommunication all slave-holders,a cry of robbery went forth, and the Jesuits were banished from the town.But in this matter of slavery there is no saying what view any one given manwill take upon it when he finds himself in such a country as America wasduring the time the Jesuits were in Paraguay.  Don Felix de Azara,a liberal and a philosopher, a man of science, and who has left usperhaps the best description both of Paraguay and of the River Plate,written in the eighteenth century, yet was a partisan of slavery.*2*In a most curious passage for a Liberal philosopher, he says:*3*`The Court ordered Don Francisco, Judge of the High Court of Charcas,to go to Peru in the character of visitor.  The first measure which he took,in 1612, was to order that in future no one should go to the Indians' houseswith the pretext of reducing them (i.e., to civilization),and that no `encomiendas' (fiefs) should be given of the kindwe have explained -- that is to say, with personal service (of the Indians).I cannot understand on what he could have founded a measureso politically absurd; but as that judge favoured the `ideas of the Jesuits',it is suspected that they dictated his conduct.'--*1* `Conquista Espiritual', Ruiz Montoya.*2* `Voyage dans l'Ame/rique Me/ridionale'.*3* Azara, `Viage al America Meridional', tomo 2, cap 12.  `La corte    ordeno/ a Don Francisco de Alfaro oidor de la Audiencia de Charcas    pasar al Peru/ en calidad de visitador.  La primera medida    que tomo/ en 1612 fue ordenar que ninguno en lo sucesivo pudiese    ir a casa de Indios, con el pretexto de reducirlos,    y que no se diesen encomiendas del modo que hemos explicado,    es decir con servicio personal.  No alcanzo sobre que podia fundarse    una medida tan politicamente absurda:  pero como este oidor favorecia    las `ideas de los Jesuitas', se sospecho/ que por aquel tiempo    que ellos dictaron su conducta.'--What stronger testimony (coming from such a man) could possibly be found,both that the Jesuits were opposed to the enslaving of the Indiansand that their opposition rendered them unpopular?  In the same way,no doubt, some modern, unwise philosopher, writing in Brussels,would uphold the slavery and massacres in Belgian Africaas evidences of a wise policy, because the end condones the means,and in the future, when progress has had time to fructify,there will be workhouses dotted all up and down the Congo, and every `native'will be forced to supply himself, at but a trifle above the cost in Belgium,with a sufficiency of comfortable and thoroughly well-seasoned wooden shoes.So it appears that the aforesaid were the two chief reasonswhich made the Jesuits unpopular with the Spanish settlers in Paraguay.But in addition it should be remembered that there were in that countrymembers of almost all the other religious Orders, and that,as nearly every one of them had quarrelled with the Jesuits in Europe,or at the best were jealous of their power, the enmities begun in Europewere transmitted to the New World, and constantly fannedby reports of the quarrels which went on between the various Ordersall through Europe, and especially in Rome.But if it were the case that the Jesuits excited feelings of hatredin their neighbours, yet they certainly had the giftof attaching to themselves the Indians' hearts.  No institution,condemned with contumely and thrust out of a countrywhere it had worked for long, its supposed crimes kept secret,and its members all condemned unheard, could have preservedits popularity amongst the descendants of the men with whom it worked,after more than one hundred years have passed, had this not been the case.I care not in the least for theories, for this or that dogmaof politicians or theologists, but take my stand on what I heard myselfduring my visits to the now ruined Jesuit missions in Paraguay.Horsemen say horses can go in any shape, and, wonderful as it may seem,men can be happy under conditions which no writer on political economywould recognise as fit for human beings.  Not once but many timeshave aged Indians told me of what their fathers used to say about the Jesuits,and they themselves always spoke of them with respect and kindness,and endeavoured to keep up to the best of their abilityall the traditions of the Church ceremonies and hours of prayerwhich the Jesuits had instilled.That the interior system of their government was perfect,or such as would be suitable for men called `civilized' to-day,is not the case.  That it was not only suitable, but perhaps the bestthat under all the circumstances could have been devised for Indian tribestwo hundred years ago, and then but just emerged from semi-nomadism,is, I think, clear, when one remembers in what a state of misery and despairthe Indians of the `encomiendas'* and the `mitas' passed their lives.That semi-communism, with a controlling hand in administrative affairs,produced many superior men, or such as rise to the topin modern times, I do not think; but, then, who are the men,and by the exercise of what kind of virtues do they risein the societies of modern times?  The Jesuits' aim was to makethe great bulk of the Indians under their control contented,and that they gained their end the complaints against themby the surrounding population of slave-holders and hunters after slavesgo far to prove.--* For `mitas' and `encomiendas', see foregoing chapters.--Leaving upon one side their system of administration,and discounting their unalterable perseverance, there were two thingson which the Jesuits appealed to the Indians; and those two things,by the very nature of their knowledge of mankind, they knew appealedas much to Indians as to any other race of men.  Firstly (and in thiswriters opposed to them, as Brabo* and Azara,** both agree),they instilled into the Indians that the land on which they lived,with missions, churches, herds, flocks, and the rest, was their own property.And in the second place they told them they were free, and that they hadthe King of Spain's own edict in confirmation of their freedom,so that they never could be slaves.  Neither of these two propositionscommends itself to many writers on the Jesuits in Paraguay,but for all that it seems to me that in themselves they were sufficientto account for the firm hold the Jesuits had on their neophytes.--* Brabo, `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a la expulsion de las Jesuitas'.** `Voyage dans l'Ame/rique Me/ridionale'.--The freedom which the Indians enjoyed under the Jesuit rulemight not have seemed excessive to modern minds and those attunedto the mild rule of the Europeans of to-day in Africa.  Such as it was,it seemed sufficient to the Guaranis, and even, in a limited degree,placed them above the Indians of the Spanish settlements,who for the most part passed their lives in slavery.Chapter VIII  Don Jose de Antequera -- Appoints himself Governor of Asuncion --  Unsettled state of affairs in the town -- He is commanded  to relinquish his illegal power -- He refuses, and resorts to arms --  After some success he is defeated and condemned to be executed -- He is shot  on his way to the scaffold -- Renewed hatred against the Jesuits --  Their labours among the Indians of the ChacoFrom the departure of Cardenas in 1650, to about 1720,was the halcyon period of the Jesuit missions in Paraguay.During that time things went on in the missions after the fashionI have attempted to describe.  The people passed their timein their semi-communistic labour, sweetened by constant prayer;their pastors may or may not have done all that was possible to instruct themin the science of the time; but, still, the Indian populationdid not decrease, as it was observed to do from year to yearin other countries of America and in the Spanish settlements in Paraguay.*During this period the Jesuits had made repeated efforts, but without muchreal success, to establish missions amongst the wild equestrian tribesin the Gran Chaco upon the western bank of the river Paraguay.Nothing, apparently, pointed to the events which, beginning in the year 1721,finally led to their expulsion, or, at least, furnished additional reasonsto King Charles III. to include the Jesuits in Paraguay inthe general expulsion of their order from the dominions of the Spanish crown.--* P. Cardiel (`Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 449), quoting from Xarque  (`La Vida Apostolica del Padre Joseph Cataidino', Zaragoca por  Juan de Ypa, 1664), says, re the diminution of the Indians  under the Spanish rule:  `Para que se vea cuanta razon tiene el Juez  reparese que segun los padrones del siglo pasado (vg. 1600-1700)  en la ciudad y jurisdicion de Santiago del Estero habia  80,000 Indios y ahora, apenas hay ochenta.  En la jurisdicion  de Cordoba de Tucuman, habia 40,000; hoy no hay 40.  En la jurisdicion y cercanias de la ciudad de Buenos Ayres,  habia 30,000; hoy apenas hay 30.'--In that year (1721) Don Jose de Antequera was appointedto succeed the Governor of Paraguay, Don Diego de los Reyes Balmaceda,when his term of office had expired.  The situation was,as often happened in the Spanish colonies, complicated by an inquiryinto the conduct of the Governor (Balmaceda), in progressat the High Court of Charcas, which court, as in the case of Cardenas,acted most cautiously, both on account of its position, so far from Paraguay,and on account of the inordinate procrastination of everything connectedwith the Spanish law.  If Balmaceda were condemned, then Antequerawould step into his shoes at once.  If, on the other hand, he were acquitted,Antequera would have to wait until the legal time of officehad run its course.  So far all was in order, but the High Court,either in doubt of its own wisdom or of its power to pronouncejudgment definitely, had issued a decree suspending Balmacedafrom his functions, but without either condemning or acquitting him.This, too, they did after having taken more than three yearsto sift the evidence and summon witnesses, who either hadto cross the country on a mule at the imminent risk of deathby famine or by Indians, or, having descended the river Plate to Buenos Ayres(which journey often took a month), wait for a ship to take themround Cape Horn to Lima, and from thence travel to Charcas on muleback,following one of the Incas' roads.Don Jose de Antequera y Castro was born at Lima, and being,as Father Charlevoix* says, an able, eloquent, but vain and mostambitious man, endowed with plenty of imagination, some talent,and but little ballast, was not content to wait till time should place himin his governorship.  So, hearing that a judge inquisitorwas to be sent to Paraguay to inquire into the case, and havinggraduated himself and held the position of procurator fiscal in the Charcas,he solicited the post, and by some error was appointed.--* Charlevoix, vol. ii., livre xvii.--No sooner was the appointment signed than straight he posted off to Paraguay.As he had studied in the college of the Jesuits at La Plata,his first visit was to the reductions of the Jesuits.The missionaries received him well, and sent a troop of Indiansto escort him to the boundary of their territories, never suspectingwhat Antequera was about to do.  Having heard that the Governor, Balmaceda,was at a distant port upon the Parana, Antequera hastened to Asuncion.Arrived there, the same madness of authority seems to have come on himwhich came fifty or sixty years before his time on Cardenas.Finding no special seat reserved for him in the Cathedral, he publiclyreproved the dean, to the great scandal of the worshippers.  This seems notto have lost him the respect of the citizens of Asuncion, who were accustomedto all kinds of vagaries, both of their rulers and their spiritual guides.No sort of violence to laws and customs seems ever to affect a peopleunless the violence is done to benefit them, when instantlythey rise against the breaker of the law, however heavily it may bearupon themselves.But the devoted citizens of Asuncion were so accustomedto perpetual turmoil that, as Dean Funes* says, `they only stoppedwhen it was absolutely necessary for them to breathe.'Even the overpraised citizens of Athens at the time of Pericles,who must have been in all their ways so like the Athenians of to-day,were not more instant in the Agora or diligent in writingpatriots' names on oyster-shells than the noisy mob of half-breed patriotswho in the sandy streets of Asuncion were ever agitating,always assembling, and doing everything within their powerto show the world the perfect picture of a democratic State.Strange that such turbulent and patriotic people should have beenancestors of those whom I, after the termination of the warwith Buenos Ayres and Brazil in 1870, knew as lethargic and downtrodden,as if the great dictator, Dr. Francia, whom the country people,speaking in bated breath, called `El Difunto', had still oppressed the land.Into the turbulent hotbed of Asuncion fell Antequera,one of those Creoles of Peru who, born with talent and well educated,seemed, either from the circumstances of their birth or the surroundingsamongst which they passed their youth, to differ as entirelyfrom the Spaniards as if they had been Indians and not Creoles of white blood.Like Cardenas, Antequera was endowed with eloquence; but, unlike Cardenas,he set no store on eloquence upon its own account, but only used itfor his own advancement in the world.  Finding the Governorabsent from Asuncion and lying under a decree suspending himfrom all his functions, it seems at once to have occurred to Antequerato seize his place.  On this account, having ingratiated himself withsome of those opposed to Balmaceda, he raised an army, and sent to seize him;but the Governor, having notice of the plot, escaped to Corrientes,and Antequera instantly assumed his post.  This was too muchfor the Viceroy of Peru, who, though he had befriended Antequera in the past,had some respect for law.  Immediately he issued a decree replacing Balmacedain the governorship, and ordering Antequera to give him backthe power he had usurped.  This Antequera had no thought of doing,and he embarked on a career of violence which induced someto believe he intended to proclaim himself an independent king.Whether this was or was not the case, a state of things arose in Paraguaymore pandemonic even than in the good old times of Cardenas.The Jesuits, not having seen their way to sustain the cause of their ex-pupil,were expelled once more (1725), and as before took ship for Corrientesamongst the tears of the people, their historians say,**and as Ibanez and those who have written against them affirm as strongly,amongst universal joy.  Certain it is that in Asuncion they playeda different part from that played by them in the mission territory,and no doubt mixed, as did the other Orders of religion, in the intrigueswhich never seemed to cease in the restless capital of Paraguay.--* Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,  vol. ii., cap. v., p. 231.** Del Techo, Lozano, Guevara, Charlevoix, etc., etc.--Not being content with the expulsion of the Jesuits, Antequera defeatedseveral generals sent against him by the Viceroy of Peru,and by a `coup de main' took prisoner the ex-Governor Balmaceda,having surprised him in his house in Corrientes, and carried himback to Asuncion under a close guard.  The usual reign of terror then began,and everything fell into confusion, till at last the King (Philip V.)in 1726 commanded that the Jesuits should be reinstatedin their college in Asuncion, and that the missions should be takenfrom the jurisdiction of the Governors of Paraguay and placed underthe control of the Governor of the River Plate, as had been previously donein the case of the other Jesuit missions beyond the Uruguay.But Spain was far away, and on one pretext or another so much delay occurredthat it was not till March 18, 1728, that the Jesuits were reinstatedin the college in Asuncion, which they were now fatedto hold but for a little space.  At last the Viceroy of Peru,the Marquess of Castel Fuerte, sent Don Bruno de Zavalawith a sufficient army and six thousand Indians from the missionsagainst the usurper Antequera, who fled for refuge to the Franciscan conventin Cordoba, where he remained, till, finding his position quite untenable,he fled to Charcas, where he was arrested, and sent to Limato await his trial.  Four years he waited in perfect liberty,going and coming about the town as it best pleased him, whilst the High Courtheard evidence, wrote to Madrid, received instructions from the King,and generally displayed the incapacity which in all ages has beenthe chief distinctive features of every court of law.In 1731 an order came from Madrid to execute him, and withoutloss of time he was placed on a horse draped all in black,and, preceded by a herald and guarded by a troop of guards, taken outto the public square to be beheaded.  But the good people of the capital,who, in the fashion of the world, would not most probablyhave stirred a step to save a saint, were mightily concerned to see a roguereceive his due deserts.  The streets were filled with thousandscrying out `Pardon!' stones flew, and the affair looked so threateningthat the Viceroy had to get on horseback and ride amongst the crowdto calm the tumult.  The people met him with a shower of stones,and he, fearing the prisoner would escape, called on his guardsto fire upon him.  Four balls pierced Antequera, who fell dyingfrom his horse into the arms of two accompanying priests.Thus the most turbulent of all the Governors of Paraguay ceased troubling,and the executioner, after having cut off his head, exhibited it to the peoplefrom the scaffold, with the usual moral aphorism as to the traitor's fate.The triumph of the Jesuits in Asuncion was but momentary,following the general rule of triumphs, which take their way along the streetwith trumpets and with drums amid the acclamations of the crowd,and then, the pageant over, the chief actors fall back againinto the struggles and the commonplace of ordinary life.Between the years 1728 and 1730 the people of Asuncion had beenmore eager in pursuit of liberty* than was their usual wont.The citizens were divided into camps, and daily fought amongstthe sandy streets and shady orange-bordered lanes which radiatefrom almost every quarter of the town.  The rival bands of madmenwere styled respectively the `Communeros' and the `Contrabandos',and to the first Antequera throughout his residence in Limagave all the assistance in his power.  Neither of the two seems to have hadthe most elementary idea of real patriotism, or any wish for anythingbeyond the momentary triumph of the miserable party to which each belonged.One doctrine they held in common -- a hatred of the Jesuits,and of the influence they exercised against the enslaving of the Indians,which was the aim of `Contrabandos' and of `Communeros' alike.One of the rival chieftains of the factions having fled for refugeto the missions, the people of Asuncion assembled troopsto take him from his sanctuary by force.  Arrived uponthe frontier of the Jesuit territory, they found themselves opposedby an army of the Indians, who looked so formidable that the troops retiredto Asuncion, and the leaders, foiled in the field, and not having forceto attack the Jesuits in their own territory, set vigorouslyto inflame the minds of the people against them.--* Liberty is commonly only attained by blood.  It is, I think,  quite legitimate in playing the liberty game to kill  all who disagree with your party, or to banish them.  In these degenerate times, lovers of liberty have to stop short at calumny,  just as if they were mere tyrants.--They worked with such success that when, in 1732, the newsof Antequera's death reached Paraguay, the people, inflamed with the ideathat he was sacrificed to the hatred of the Jesuits, rose and expelled themonce again.  The constant expulsions of the Jesuits from Asuncion,the turmoils in the State, and the fact that every now and thenthe Indians had to take arms to defend their territory,acted most mischievously on the reductions, both in Paraguay and in thosebetween the Parana and Uruguay.  Whole tribes of Indians,recently converted, went back to the woods; land was left quite untilled,and on the outskirts of the mission territory the warlike tribes of Indians,still unsubdued, raided the cattle, killed the neophytes, and carried offtheir wives as slaves.  But still, in spite of all, the Indians clungto their priests -- as they said, from affection for the religious carethey had bestowed, but quite as possibly from the instinctive knowledge that,between the raiding Portuguese and the maddening patriots in Asuncion,their only safeguard against slavery lay in the Jesuits.Most fortunately for Paraguay at the time (1734), Don Bruno de Zavala,perhaps the most energetic of the Spaniards in the King's service in America,was Viceroy in the River Plate.  Having received orders to quietthe dissensions in Asuncion, in spite of being nearly seventy years of age,and having lost an arm in the Italian wars, he marched at once,taking but forty soldiers in his train, as, war being imminentwith Portugal, it was not safe to deplete the slender forcesin the River Plate.  Arrived in Paraguay, he entered the Jesuit missionsat the Reduction of San Ignacio Guazu,* and, having appealedto the provincial of the Order for his aid, speedily found himselfat the head of a large army of the Indians.  After some skirmisheshe was in a position to enter Asuncion and force the people to receive himas their Governor.  By one of those revulsions so frequentin a crowd of reasonable men, the people begged him to invite the Jesuitsto return.  They did so (1735), and were received in state,the Governor, the Bishop, and the chief clergy and officials of the placeattending Mass in the Cathedral with lighted candles in their hands.His duty over, Don Bruno de Zavala set off for Chile, where he had beenappointed Governor, and on his journey, at the town of Santa Fe,died suddenly, exhausted with the battles, marchings and countermarchings,rebellions, Indian incursions, the turbulence of the people in the towns,and the other cares which formed the daily duties of a Spanish officerin South America at the middle of the eighteenth century.**The next ten years were on the whole peaceful and profitablefor the Indians of the missions and for the Jesuits.The Indians followed quietly their Arcadian lives, except whennow and then a contingent of them was required to assistin any of the wars, which at that time were ceaselessthroughout the eastern part of South America.  The Jesuitspushed out their spiritual frontiers, advancing on the northamongst the Tobatines of the woods, and on the west endeavouring to spreadtheir colonies amongst the Chiriguanas and other of the Chaco tribes.--* `Guazu' = `great' in Guarani.  It is frequent in place-names  both in Paraguay and Corrientes.** Dean Funes, vol. ii., cap. xii., p. 372, says of Zavala:   `Por caracter era manso, pero uso/ algunas veces de severidad,   porque sabia que para servir bien a los hombres es preciso   de cuando en cuando tener valor de desagradarlos. . . .   La pobreza en que murio despues de tantos an~os de mando,   es una prueba clasica de que no estaba contagiado con esa commun flaqueza   de los que gobieran en America.'--From the conquest of Peru, when those Indians who had been but recentlybrought under the empire of the Incas retreated into the Chaco,it had been the refuge of the fiercest and most indomitable tribes.The Spanish colonists, the ardour of the first conquest spent,had settled down mainly to agricultural pursuits.  Few had efficient firearms,and on the whole, though turbulent amongst themselves, they hadbecome unwarlike.*  The very name of the wild Indians (Los Indios Bravos)spread terror up and down the frontiers.  This terror, which I rememberstill prevalent both in Mexico and on the pampas of the Argentine Republic,not more than five-and-twenty years ago, was keener uponthe confines of the Chaco than anywhere in South America, except, perhaps,in Chile, upon the frontiers of Araucania.--* In the long and interesting letter of Jaime Aguilar,  the provincial of the Jesuits in Paraguay, to the King of Spain  (Philip V., 1737), occurs the following passage:  `Y si alguna vez, que no son muchas, se animan los Espan~oles  a perseguir y castigar los Indios, muchos huyen de la tierra,  o se esconden, por no ir a la entrada. . . .  Otras (vezes)  quando llegan alla/, el Enemigo les quitan la Cavallada,  dexandolos a pie y se vuelven a casa como pueden.'  This I have seen myself, not thirty years ago, on the frontiers  of the Argentine Republic.  The popular Argentine poem,  `La Vuelta de Martin Fierro', by Jose Hernandez (Buenos Ayres, 1880),  has an illustration showing an expedition against the Indians returning.  Some of the men are on foot; others are riding two on the same horse,  and officers are animating their men with the flat of their swords.--The Tobas, Mataguayos, Lules, Aguilotas, Abipones, and the rest,together with the warlike nations of the Vilelas and the Guaycurus,had from the first rejected Christianity.  Attempts hadseveral times been made to establish settlements amongst them,but the ferocity of all the tribes, their nomad habits -- for many of thempassed their lives on horseback -- and the peculiar nature of their country,a vast domain of swamp, pierced by great rivers quite unknownto the Spanish settlers, had hitherto combined to render every effort vain.But, notwithstanding this, the Jesuits laboured incessantly,and not without success, amongst the wildest of the Chaco tribes.The gentle and eccentric Father Martin Dobrizhoffer passed many yearsamongst the Abipones, of whom he wrote his charming book.  He enumeratesmany tribes, of whom he says* `these are for the most converted by us,and settled in towns.'--* `Account of the Abipones', p. 125.--Nothing, perhaps, displays the Jesuits at their best, more than their effortsin the Chaco.  The enormous territory was sparsely peopledby about seventy tribes,*1* whereof there were fifteen or sixteenof considerable size.  Hardly two tribes spoke dialects by whichthey could communicate with one another, and almost every one of themlived in a state of warfare, not only with the Spaniards,but with the neighbouring tribes.  The inventories preserved by Brabo*2*show us the town of Paisanes in the Chaco, with its rough wooden houses,and the Jesuits' habitation in the middle of the place,stockaded, and without doors, and with but narrow openings in the wall,through which the missionaries crept.  The inside of the housecontained five or six rough rooms, almost unfurnished,but for a few religious books and a plentiful supply of guns.*3*Their beds were of unvarnished wood, with curtains of rough cottonspun by the Indians.  Sometimes they had a sofa of leather slungbetween four stakes, a rack for medicine bottles, and for the wine for Mass.Lastly, one priest, in the settlement amongst the Toquitistines,had among his books copies of Cervantes and Quevedo; one hopes he read themhalf smiling, half with a tear in his eye, for your true humouris akin to tears.  Perhaps, reading `Don Quixote' or `El Gran Tacano',the poor priest forgot his troubles, and, wandering with Sanchoin La Manchan oak-woods or through Castilian uplands,thought he was in Spain.*4*--*1* Brabo, `Inventarios', p. ix.*2* Francisco Xavier Brabo, `Inventarios de los bienes hallados    a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas' (Madrid, 1872).*3* The lists of cannons, guns, and arms of all kinds    in the inventories of the Chaco towns, preserved by Brabo,    serve to show not only the dangers to which the Jesuits were exposed,    but also how thoroughly the Jesuits understood the fickle nature of those    with whom they lived.*4* Another priest, the list of whose effects Brabo has preserved    in his `Inventarios', had a book called `El Alivio de Tristes'.    Even a Protestant may be excused for hoping that it merited its title.--Throughout the territory of the Gran Chaco there were but seven reductionsestablished by the Jesuits.  These were San Jose de Bilelas,with its little town Petacas; San Juan Bautista de los Iristines,with its townlet of the same name; San Esteban de los Lules,with the town of Miraflores; Nuestra Senora del Buen Consejode los Omarapas, capital Ortega; Nuestra Senora de Pilar de los Paisanes,with Macapillo as its centre; Nuestra Senora del Rosario de los Tobas,with its chief place called San Lucas; and, lastly, the establishment amongstthe Abipones, known as La Concepcion.  In all these missions the Jesuits livedin constant peril of their lives.  In reading their old chroniclesone finds the records of their obscure and half-forgotten martyrdoms,their sufferings, and the brief record of their deathsby an arrow or a club.  In 1711 Father Cavallero, with all his following,was slain by the savage Pinzocas.  In 1717 Father Romero,having, as a Jesuit writer says, `nothing but moral force behind him,'*was slain with twelve companions of the Guaranis of Paraguay.In 1718 Fathers Arco and Blende, Sylva and Maceo, received their dusted-overmartyrs' crowns.--* Cretineau Joly, tome v., chap. ii., p. 95.  Your moral force is excellent  in a civilized country; but your modern missionary usually prefers something  more in accordance with the spirit of the times.--Right up the western bank of the river Paraguay, in the old maps, the crossesmark the sites where Jesuits were slain.  That they all died to furthercrafty schemes, or for some hidden purpose of a Machiavelian nature,even a Dominican will scarcely urge.  That they did good -- more or less goodthan Protestant fanatics of the same kidney might have achieved --it were invidious to inquire.  That which is certain is that they weresingle-hearted men, faithful unto the end to what they thought was right,faithful even to the shedding of their own blood, which is, one may believe,the way in which the scriptural injunction should be rightly read.In the dim future, when some shadow of common-sense dawns on the world,and when men recognise that it is better to let others follow their destinyas it best pleases them, without the officious interference of their fellows,it may be that they will say all missionaries of whatsoeversect or congregation should have stayed at home, and not gone gaddingto the desert places of the earth seeking to remedy the errors of their Godby their exertions; but whilst the ideal still remains of sacrifice(which may, for all I know, be useless in itself, or even harmful),they must perforce allow the Jesuits in Paraguay high rank,or else be stultified.But in the Chaco the Jesuits found conditions most differentfrom those prevailing in their missions between the Uruguay and Parana.Instead of open plains, vast swamps; instead of docile semi-Arcadianslike the Guaranis, who almost worshipped them, fierce nomad horsemen,broken into a hundred little tribes, always at war, and caring littlefor religion of any sort or kind.  Again, there seems in the Chacoto have been no means of amassing any kind of wealth, as all the territorywas quite uncultivated and in a virgin state; but, still,the settlements had existed long enough for cattle to increase.*Lastly, the incursions of the barbarous tribes were a constant menaceboth to the Jesuits and their neophytes.  Yet in their indefatigable waythe Jesuits made considerable progress amongst the Chaco tribes,as both the curious `History of the Abipones' by Father Dobrizhofferand the inventories preserved by Brabo prove.**--* The total number of cattle was 78,171, as against  698,353 in the towns of the Guaranis.  See Brabo,  `Inventarios de los bienes hallados a/ la expulsion de los Jesuitas',  Appendix, p. 668.** `History of the Abipones', from the Latin of Martin Dobrizhoffer,   London, 1822.   It is a curious circumstance that in the missions in the Chaco   there were negro slaves, though in the Paraguayan missions   they were unknown.  In the inventory of the town of San Lucas   appear the following entries, under the head of `Negros Esclavos':   `Justo, que sirve de capataz en el campo; sera/ de edad   de veinte y siete an~os, mas o/ menos segun su aspecto.'   `Item, Pedro, sera/ de diez y seis an~os y es medio fatuo.'   `Item, Jose/ Felix, sera/ de un mes y medio.'--Besides their seven establishments in the Gran Chaco,they had three establishments in the north of Paraguayin the great woods which fringe the central mountain range of the country,known as the Cordillera de M'baracayu.  These missions,called San Joaquin del Taruma, San Estanislao, and Belen,were quite apart from all the other missions of the Guaranis,far distant from the Chaco, and removed by an enormous distancefrom those of the Order in the Moxos and amongst the Chiquitos,forming, as it were, an oasis in the recesses of the Tarumensian woods.These three reductions, founded respectively in 1747,* 1747, and 1760,were, as their dates indicate, the swansong of the Jesuits in Paraguay.Founded as they were far from the Spanish settlements, they were quite removedfrom the intrigues and interferences of the Spanish settlers,which were the curse of the other missions on the Parana.The Tobatines Indians** were of a different class to the Guaranis,though possibly of the same stock originally.  Not having comein contact until recent years with the Spaniards, and having hadtwo fierce and prolonged wars with the nearest settlements,they had remained more in their primitive condition than any of the Indianswith whom the Jesuits had come in contact in Paraguay.During the short period of Jesuit rule amongst them (1746-1767)things seem to have gone on in a half-Arcadian way.  In San Joaquin,Dobrizhoffer, as he says himself, devoted eight years of unregretted labourto the Indians.  Most certainly he was one of the Jesuitswho understood the Indians best, and his descriptions of them and their lifeare among the most delightful which have been preserved.He tells of the romantic but fruitless search during eighteen monthsthroughout the forests of the Taruma by Fathers Yegros, Escandon,Villagarcia, and Rodriguez, for the Itatines who had leftthe reduction of Nuestra Senora de Santa Fe, and had hidden in the woods.--* Though 1747 was the date of the final founding of these reductions,  as early as 1697 about four hundred Indians were discovered  in the woods of the Taruma by Fathers Robles and Ximenes,  and established in the mission of Nuestra Senora de Fe;  but in the year 1721 they all returned to the woods,  a famine and an outbreak of the small-pox having frightened them.  After being again established in a mission, and again having left it,  in 1746, they were established definitely at San Joaquin.** Dobrizhoffer calls the Tobatines by the name of Itatines.   Charlevoix and others refer to them as Tobatines.--Then, commenting upon the strangeness of all affairs sublunary,he relates that accident at length effected what labour could not do.In 1746 Father Sebastian de Yegros, after a search of forty days,came on the Indians -- as it were, directed by Providence,or, as we now say, accident.  He built a town for them,and, as Dobrizhoffer says, `assembled them in Christian polity.'To the new-founded village cattle of every kind were sent,with clothes -- useful, of course, to those who had never worn them --axes, and furniture, and lastly a few music masters,* without whose helpthose who build cities spend their toil in vain.--* `Account of the Abipones', p. 54.--To the new town (in which the simple-hearted priest remained eight years),in 1753, came Don Carlos Morphi, an Irishman, and Governor of Paraguay;and, having stayed five days with Dobrizhoffer, departed,marvelling at the accuracy with which the new-made Christians(`Cristianos nuevos') managed their double-basses, their flageolets,their violins, and, in general, all their instruments,whether of music or of war.Modestly, but with prolixity, as befits a virtuous, God-fearing man,the simple Jesuit relates a special instance of the way in whichhe was enabled to work both for his own glory and for the profit of the Lord.Not far from San Estanislao was situate the forest of M'baevera,in which grew quantities of trees from which the `yerba-mate'(Paraguayan tea) was made.  To reach it was a work of pain and trouble,for through the woods a track called a `picada' had to be cut;the rivers were deep, bridgeless, and had to have branches strewedalong the track to give a footing to the struggling mules.*--* In 1873, when I visited the outskirts of this forest,  the conditions were similar to those which Dobrizhoffer describes,  with the addition that the depopulation of the country,  owing to the recent long war, had allowed the tigers to multiply  to an extraordinary degree, and my guide and myself,  after feeding our horses, had to sleep alternately,  the waker holding the two horses hobbled and bridled.--An expedition having been sent under a certain Spaniard called Villalbato collect `yerba', came suddenly upon a deserted Indian hut.As they had started quite unarmed, except with knives and axesto cut down the boughs, a panic seized them, and, instead of collectingany leaves,* they hurried back to San Estanislao.  No soonerdid Dobrizhoffer hear the news than he set out to find the Indians,with a few neophytes, upon his own account.  Having travelledthe `mournful solitudes' for eighteen days, they came upon no sign of Indians,and returned footsore and hungry, `the improvement of our patiencebeing our sole recompense.'--* The whole operation of collecting and preparing the leaves  of the `Ilex Paraguayensis', to make the `yerba-mate', was most curious.  Bands of men used to sally out for a six-months' expedition,  either by land with bullock-waggons, or up one of the rivers  in flat-bottomed boats, which were poled along against the rapid current  by crews of six to twelve men.  Arrived at the `yerbal',  as the forest was called, they built shelters, after the fashion of those  in use amongst the larger of the anthropoid apes.  Some roamed the woods  in search of the proper trees, the boughs of which they cut down  with machetes, whilst others remained and built a large shed of canes  called a `barbacoa'.  On this shed were laid the bundles of boughs  brought from the woods, and a large fire was lighted underneath.  During forty-eight hours (if I remember rightly) the toasting went on;  then, when sufficiently dry, the leaves were stripped from the twigs,  and placed on a sort of open space of hard clay, something like  a Spanish threshing-floor.  On this they were pounded fine,  and the powder rammed into raw-hide bags.  This concluded the operations,  and the `yerba' was then ready for the `higgling of the market'.--He himself walked all the way, and `often barefoot',suffering `what neither I can describe nor yet my reader credit.'The missionary calling has undergone considerable change since 1750.Hardships which the greater faith or stronger constitutionsof the missionaries of the last century rendered endurableare now largely fallen out of fashion, and your missionaryseldom walks barefoot, even in a wood, because to do so would give offence,and bring discredit on the society for which he works.Though unsuccessful in his search that year, Dobrizhoffer,not daunted by his barefoot marching, set out again upon the Gospel trailnext spring.  After another journey of some twenty days,during the whole course of which it rained incessantly,he came on a community of seemingly quite happy sylvans,whom he proceeded to convert.  In the first hut he met withthere were eight doors, and in it dwelt some sixty Indians --a palm-built, grass-thatched phalanstery, with hammocks slungfrom the rude beams, in which `these heathen' used to sleep.Each separate family had its own fire, on the hearth of whichstood mugs and gourds and pots of rudely-fashioned earthenware.Naked and not ashamed `these savages', and the men wore upon their headshigh crowns of parrot feathers.  For arms they carried bows and arrows,and the first man Dobrizhoffer saw was holding a dead pheasant in one hand,and in the other a short bow.  In the woods around the phalansterywas an `amazing' quantity of maize, of fruits of divers sorts, and of tobacco.From the hives which the wild bees make in hollow trees, they collected honeyin large quantities, which served them (at least so Dobrizhoffer says)for meat and drink alike.Their name for the god they worshipped was Tupa, but `of that Godand his commandments they care to know but little.'  This sounds ambiguous,and would appear at first sight as if the confidence betwixtthe creators and their God had been but slight.  Perhaps the ambiguitymay be set down to the translator* who turned the Latinin which the memoirs first were formed into the vulgar tongue.--* `Traduttore traditore', as the proverb says.--A thing remarkable enough when one considers how prone mankind isto act differently was that, although the Itatines knew an evil spiritunder the name of Ana, yet they paid little adoration to him,apparently content to know as little of him and his lawsas they did of their God.Those hapless, harmless folk, as innocent of God and devil, right and wrong,and all the other things which by all rights they should have known,as they are said to be implanted in the mind of man, no matter what his state,seem to have lived quite happily in their involuntary sin.*  But Dobrizhoffer,in his simple faith and zeal for what he thought was right, wept bitter tearswhen he thought upon their unregenerate state.--* Charlevoix says, in his `Histoire de la Nouvelle France',  speaking of the Indians in general:  `L'expe/rience a fait voir  qu'il e/toit plus a\ propos de les laisser dans leur simplicite/  et dans leur ignorance, que les sauvages peuvent e^tre des bons Chre/tiens  sans rien prendre de notre politesse et de notre fac,on de vivre,  ou du moins qu'il falloit laisser faire au tems pour les tirer  de leur grossie\rete/, qui ne les empe^che pas de vivre  dans une grande innocence, d'avoir beaucoup de modestie,  et de servir Dieu avec une pie/te/ et une ferveur, que les rendent  tre\s propres aux plus sublimes ope/rations de la gra^ce.'  Had more people thought with Charlevoix, and not been too anxious  to draw savages incontrovertibly to our `politesse' (sic) and `fac,on',  and left more to time (`au tems'), how much misery might have been saved,  and how many interesting peoples preserved!  For, in spite of the domination  of the Anglo-Saxon race, it might have been wise to leave other types,  if only to remind us of our superiority.--A sycophantic Guarani from the reductions then took up his parable,and said:  `God save ye, brothers; we are come to visit you as friends.This father-priest is God's own minister, and comes to visit you,and pray for your estate.'  An aged Indian interrupted him,saying he did not want a father-priest, and that St. Thomas in the pasthad prayed sufficiently, as fruits of every sort abounded in the land.The Indian, in his unsophisticated way, seems to have thoughtthe presence of a priest acted but as manure on the ground where he abode;but the Jesuit, almost as simple-minded as himself, took it in kindliness,and journeyed with the Indian to a large village about three days away.Arrived there, all the inhabitants of the place sat in a circleround the missionary.  They appeared (he says) in so much modesty and silence`that I seemed to behold statues, and not live Indians.'To awaken their attention he played upon the viol d'amore,and, having thus captured their ears, began to preach to them.The good priest probably believed all that he said, for, after dwellingon the perils of the road, he said:  `My friends, my errandis to make you happy.'  It did not seem to him that their free life in woods,in which abounded maize, fruits, and tobacco, with game of every kind,could possibly have induced content.  Content, as Christians know,comes but with faith, and a true knowledge of the dogmais above liberty.  Kindly, but muddle-headedly, he deplored their lot,their want of clothes, their want of interest in their God,their lack of knowledge of that God's commands.  Then, coming to the point,he spoke of hell, and told the astonished Indians that it was quite impossiblefor them to avoid its flames, unless, taught by a priest,they came to know God's law.  He then briefly (as he says)explained the mysteries of our faith.  They listened rapt,except that `the boys laughed a little' when he spoke of hell.*Nothing more painful than to see a child laughing unconscious of its perilin the traffic of a crowded street, and we may well believethat the kind-hearted Dobrizhoffer shuddered at the laughter of these childrenwhen he reflected that had he taken the wrong path,crossing the marshes or in the woods, the laughers had been damned.Much more he said to them after exhausting hell, and, to `add weight'to his oration, presented each of them with scissors, knives,glass beads, axes, small looking-glasses, and fishing-hooks, for he knew wellthat sermons which end in `give me' have but a small effect.--* Hell not infrequently seems to have struck the Indians as a joke,  for Charlevoix relates that when the first missionaries  expatiated on its flames to the Chirignanos, they said,  `If there is fire in hell, we could soon get enough water  to put it out.'  This answer scandalized the good priest,  who could not foresee that the flames of Tophet would be extinguished  without the necessity of any other waters than those of indifference.--He says himself quite frankly, `I seemed to have borne down all before mebecause I had mingled my oration with a copious largess.'*Glass beads and looking-glasses have from the time whenthe first Christian missionary preached to the Indiansbeen potent factors in conversion, and still to-day do yeoman servicein the great work of bringing souls to God.--* `Account of the Abipones', p. 74.--Seated around the fire `smoking tobacco through a reed',and pondering perchance over the mysteries of the new expounded faith,the `cacique' of the Itatines took up his parable.`I have' (said he) `conceived an affection for the father-priest,and hope to enjoy his company throughout my life.  My daughteris the prettiest girl in the whole world, and I am now resolvedto give her to the father-priest, that he may always stay with me,and with my family, here in the woods.'The Indians from the missions broke into laughter, after the fashionof all those who, knowing but a little, think that they are wise.The `cacique', who knew nothing, was astounded that any man,no matter what his calling, could live without a wife, and asked the Jesuitif the strange thing was true.  His doubts being satisfied, they felldiscoursing on the nature of the Deity, a subject not easy of exhaustion,and difficult to treat of through the medium of an interpreter.`We know' (the `cacique' said) `that there is someone who dwells in heaven.'This vagueness put the missionary upon his mettle, and he set out at onceto expatiate upon the attributes of God.  They seemed to please the `cacique',who inquired, `What is it that displeases, then, the dweller in the skies?'Lies, calumnies, adulteries, thefts, all were enumerated,and received the Indian's assent; but the injunction not to killprovoked a bystander to ask if it was not permitted to a man to slay thosewho attacked his life.  He added, `I have endeavoured so to dosince the first day I carried arms.'`Fanatical casuist' is a stout argument in the mouth of a mannurtured upon Suarez and Molina, but no doubt it did good service,and Dobrizhoffer uses it when speaking of the chief.  But Dobrizhofferdid better work than mere theological disputation, for he prevailed uponeighteen of the Indians to accompany him to the settlement of San Joaquin;and after having `for some months tried the constancy' of a youthcalled Arapotiyu, he admitted him to the sacrament of baptism,and `not long afterwards united him in marriage according tothe Christian rites.'  It is evident that baptism should precede marriage;but it is an open question as to the duration of the intervalbetween the two ceremonies, and we may be permitted to wonder whether,after all, both might not be advantageously dispensed at the same time.In the case of Arapotiyu the system worked satisfactorily,for he `surpassed in every kind of virtue, and might have been takenfor an old disciple of Christianity.'  Even `old Christians' occasionally,despite their more laborious induction into the rites and customsof their faith, have fallen from grace, perhaps from the undue prolongationof the term between the ceremonies.In the case of another youth (one Gato) things did not goso smoothly, for though he, too, by his conduct obtainedboth baptism and Christian wedlock, Dobrizhoffer adds without comment,`not many months after he died of a slow disease.'*  The slow diseasewas not improbably the nostalgia of the woods, from whichthe efforts of the good missionary had so successfully withdrawn him.--* Padre del Techo, in his `History of Paraguay', says of the wood Indians  that `they died like plants which, grown in the shade,  will not bear the sun.'--The labours of the Jesuits in the three isolated missionsin the north of Paraguay* seem to have been as successfulas those in the Chaco were unfortunate.  In dealing withthe wild equestrian tribes of the Gran Chaco, the system of the Jesuitswas not so likely to achieve success as amongst the peaceful Guaranis.That of the Spanish settlers was entirely ineffectual, and has remained sodown to the present day, when still the shattered remnants of the Lules,Lenguas, Mocobios, and the rest, roam on their horses or in their canoesabout the Chaco and its rivers, having received no other benefitsfrom contact with the European races but gunpowder and gin.--* San Joaquin, San Estanislao, and Belen.--Chapter IX  The Spanish and Portuguese attempt to force new laws on the Indians --  The Indians revolt against them -- The hopeless struggle goes on  for eight years -- Ruin of the missionsThe missions in the Chaco and the Taruma, all founded between 1700 and 1760,the last (Belen) but seven years before the expulsion of the Jesuitsfrom America, go far towards disproving the allegations of some writers,*1*that the apostolic energy of the first foundations had decayed,and that the Jesuits were merely living on the good name of the first foundersin the beginning of the past century.  But let the zeal of any class of menbe what it may, if they oppose themselves to slavery and at the same timeare reported to have lands in which is gold, and resolutelyexclude adventurers from them, their doom is sealed.Both crimes were set down to the Jesuits.  Writing in 1784,or twenty years after the expulsion of his order, Dobrizhoffer refersto the Indians of the reductions as `being in subjection*2*only to the Catholic King and the royal Governors, not in dreaded slaveryamongst private Spaniards as the other Indians;' and Montoya, Lozano,and Del Techo, writing in earlier times, all confirm the statement,which is also doubly confirmed by the various royal edicts on the subject.*3*The reports of gold-mines, too, had never ceased, although they had beenrepeatedly disproved, and those, together with the stand for freedomfor the Indians, led to the events which finally brought aboutthe expulsion of the Order from the territories where they had worked so long.--*1* Notably those of Azara.*2* `Account of the Abipones', p. 15.*3* As that of Philip V., from the palace of Buen Retiro, December 28, 1743,    and his two letters to the Jesuits of Paraguay.  Also the previous edict    obtained by Montoya from Philip II., and by the various additions    on the same head made from time to time to the code    known as `The Laws of the Indies'.--In 1740, Gomez de Andrade, Governor for the King of Portugalin Rio de Janeiro, being one of those who was convincedthat the reason why the Jesuits guarded their territories so religiouslywas that they had mines, bethought him of a plan.  His plan,like most of those conceived on the fantastic reasonswhich are called `of State', took no account of sentiment, and therefore,as mankind are and will ever be a thousand times more influenced by sentimentthan by hard reasoning, was from the first bound of itself to fail.The colony of Sacramento upon the river Plate had for a hundred yearsbeen the source of conflict between the Spaniards and the Portuguese.*1*Situated as it was almost in front of Buenos Ayres, it servedas a depot for smugglers; and, moreover, being fortified,menaced the navigation both of the Parana and Paraguay.Slavers from England, Holland, and the German ports crowded the harbour.Arms of all kinds were stored there, and were distributed to all adventurerswho meditated assaults against the crown of Spain.  Twice or three timesit had been taken and restored, the Indians of the missionsalways rendering most efficient help.  At the time of which I write (1740)it had passed again by treaty under the dominion of the Portuguese,but still remained a standing menace to the Spaniards.Gomez Andrade advised the court of Lisbon to exchange it againstthe seven reductions*2* of the Uruguay, and thus at onceto secure a country rich in gold and to adjust the frontierat the river Uruguay.  Nothing appears so simple to a statesmanas to exchange one piece of territory for another.  A parchment signedafter some international negotiations, and the whole thing is done.If, though, as happened in this case, one of the territoriescontains a population such as that which inhabited the seven townsupon the Uruguay, and which has conquered the country in which it livesfrom virgin forest, and defended it against all comers, it sometimes happensthat the unreasonable inhabitants, by clinging to their homes,defeat the statesmen's plans.  Yet statesmen, once embarked in any plan,do not stick at such trifles as the affection of a people for its home,but quietly pursue their path, knowing that that which is conceivedby ministers of State must in the end be beneficial to mankind.Without this patriotic abnegation of their feelings, no statesmenwould be worthy of the name.  Indifference to the feelings of othersis perhaps the greatest proof a public man can give of his attachmentto the State.  After negotiations, lasting many years,in 1750 a treaty was signed between Portugal and Spain agreeing thatthe former should give up the Colonia del Sacramento to the Spaniardsin exchange for the seven Jesuit towns upon the Uruguay, and that both nationsshould furnish a commission to fix the frontiers of the two nationson the Uruguay.*3*  On February 15, 1750, the Spanish courtsent to the Jesuits of the seven towns to prepare their Indiansto leave their homes and march into the forests, and there found new towns.--*1* Since the discovery of America the Spaniards and the Portuguese    had been in constant rivalry throughout the south-eastern portion.    Their frontier, between what are now Brazil and Argentina, had never    been defined.  In 1494 King John II. of Castile concluded a treaty    signed at Tordesillas with the King of Portugal, placing the dividing-line    between the countries two hundred leagues more to the westward    than that of the famous Bull of Pope Alexander VI. (May 4, 1493),    which placed it at one hundred leagues west of Cape Verd,    cutting the world in two from the Arctic to the Antarctic Pole.    From the signing of the treaty of Tordesillas trouble began    in South America between the Powers, as by that treaty a portion of Brazil    came into the power of Portugal.*2* These were the towns of San Angel, San Nicolas, San Luis, San Lorenzo,    San Miguel, San Juan, and San Borja.*3* According to the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia    (in the article titled "Reductions of Paraguay") this treaty,    signed in secret on 15 January 1750, was a deliberate assault    on the Jesuit Order by the Ministers of Spain and Portugal,    the latter of whom, Pombal, is said to have been responsible    also for the false and libelous `Histoire de Nicolas I.,    Roy du Paraguai et Empereur des Mamalus' (referred to in this chapter)    which was distributed throughout Europe as another attack on the Jesuits.    As anyone familiar with the situation could see that the Indians    would not be happy about the treaty's requirement to abandon their homes,    it was a well-calculated, though detestable, move.  -- A. L., 1998.--At that date Francois Retz was General of the Jesuits, and on him devolvedthe duty of communicating the orders of the courts of Spain and Portugalto the Jesuits in the missions of the Uruguay.  Father Bernard Neyderdorfferwas the man on whom the Provincial of Paraguay (Father Barreda)imposed the task of communicating to the Indians the wishes of the two courts.Though he had lived already thirty-five years in the missions,and knew the Indians well, and was respected by them as a father,he seems at first to have shrunk from such a task.  When the news was broughtto the towns upon the Uruguay, none of the Indians at first would credit it.The `caciques' (chiefs) of the seven towns declared that theywould rather die than leave their native place.  Nothing was heardbut lamentations and expressions of hatred of the Portuguese,mingled with denunciations of the Jesuits themselves, who the poor Indiansnot unnaturally believed were in league with Spain to sell themto the Portuguese.  But in a little the clamours turned to action,and, not content with refusing to obey the edict of the two courts,the Indians broke into revolt.  Two most important narrativesof this revolt exist, one by Father Cardiel and one by Father Ennis,both of whom were witnesses of the events.  After considerable negotiations,which lasted till 1753,*1* the united troops of Portugal and Spain advancedinto the mission territory to arrange the occupation of the ceded towns.The commissioners of the two nations were, for Spain,the Marques de Valdelirios, and for Portugal General Gomez Freyre de Andrade,and both of them appear to have come to America already prejudicedagainst the Jesuits.  On March 24, 1753, Andrade wrote to Valdelirios,almost before he could have heard anything definite aboutthe mission territory, to which they both were strangers,telling him that opposition was to be expected, and that the Jesuitswere urging the Indians to revolt.*2*  The opposition thatthe two commissioners so confidently hoped to find,*3*and which contemporary writers have set forth in its true coloursas but the revolt of ignorant Indians rendered desperateby being arbitrarily dispossessed of lands which they themselveshad settled and held for almost a hundred years, was fraughtwith serious consequences, not only to the Jesuits in Paraguay,but to the Order throughout the world at large.  For years their enemieshad said the Jesuits were endeavouring to set up in the missionsa State quite independent of the Spanish crown.  By their own conductthe Jesuits to some extent had given colour to the report,for by excluding (in the interest of the Indians) all Spaniardsfrom the mission territories, it looked as if they were at workat something which they wished to keep a secret, as no one at that timedeemed it a serious plea to enter into any line of conductfor the good of Indians, whom in general the Spanish settlers looked uponas beasts.  That it was the best policy they could have possibly pursuedunder the circumstances is proved abundantly by the code of instructionslaid down by Don Francisco Bucareli, the Viceroy of Buenos Ayres,under whose auspices the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1760 was carried out.In that code occurs the following article:*4*  `You will not allowany strangers, of whatever estate, quality, or condition they may be,to reside in the town (that is, of the missions), even if they be artisans,*5*and much less that they deal or take contracts in themeither for themselves or for others, and you shall take especial carethat the Laws of the Indies be executed, and specially thosewhich are contained in Article 27 of Book IX.;*6* and alsoif any Portuguese deserters or other persons of whatever conditionsshould come to the towns, you will instantly conduct them to this city,taking every precaution to prevent their escape.'--*1* Most of the dates of the events subsequent to the cession    of the seven reductions on the Uruguay are taken from    `La Causa Jesuitica de Portugal' (Madrid, 1768), written by Ibanez,    a great enemy of the Jesuits.  In it is also an account of the events    in Paraguay between 1750 and 1756, called `Relacion de la Guerra    que sustentaron los Jesuitas contra las tropas Espan~olas y Portuguesas    en el Uruguay y Parana/'.  No proof has ever been brought forward    that the Jesuits as a body ever incited the revolt of the Indians,    though undoubtedly Father Tadeo Ennis, a hot-headed priest, stirred up    his own particular reduction to resist.  It does not seem likely    that the Jesuits could have thought it possible to wage a successful war    against Spain and Portugal.  The dates taken from Ibanez    tally with original letters from the Marques de Valdelirios,    the Spanish boundary commissioner, and others, which are preserved    in the Spanish national archives at Simancas.*2* Vide `Exc. por los cartas que recibi con los avisos,    y llegada del P. Altamirano, entiendo acabara/ de persuadirse    a que los Padres de la Campan~ia son los sublevados,    sino los quitan de las aldeas sus Santos Padres (como ellos los llaman)    no experimentara/n mas que rebeliones insolencias y desprecios. . . .'    -- Letter quoted by Ibanez (`Causa Jesuitica'), and also preserved    at Simancas.*3* The Marques de Valdelirios, writing to Don Jose de Carvajal    from Monte Video, June 28, 1752 (Simancas, Legajo 7,447), says:    `Estoy cierto de que los padres estan ya en la persuasion    de que el tratado no se ha de dejar de executar.'  This being so,    it was evident that the Marquis, at the date of writing, was of opinion    that the Jesuits were not going to oppose the execution of the treaty,    as he goes on to say:  `Y es credible que con este desengan~o trabajan    seriamente en la mudanza de sus pueblos.'*4* The instructions were prepared in 1768 by Bucareli    for the guidance of Don Juan Joseph de Vertiz, his interim successor    in the government of the River Plate, and were delivered to him in 1770    when Bucareli returned to Spain.  They are printed by Brabo in his    `Coleccion de Documentos relativos a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas',    Madrid, 1872, p. 320.*5* `Oficiales mecanicos'.*6* This refers to the same subject, and prohibits any Spaniard    from settling in an Indian town in any part of America.--Still, though their policy was pursued, it did not stopthe opponents of the Jesuits from denouncing that very policy,both at the cession of the seven towns and at the expulsion of the Orderfrom America.  The commissioners, after innumerable delays,having found themselves in 1753 at Santa Tecla, a village near the Uruguay,it becomes necessary to cast a glance at what the Jesuits themselveswere doing, and how they tried to do their duty as they saw itboth to their Sovereign, their Order, and the Indians over whom they ruled.It seems as if, whilst the superiors of the Order recognised at oncethe futility of striving against Portugal and Spain,some of the inferior members secretly set on the Indians to armed resistanceto the impolitic decree.  The council of the province (Paraguay)*1*assembled at the Jesuit college in Cordoba, composed of Fathers Masala,Horos, Caballero, Lopez, and Lozano, sent a memorial*2*both to the Viceroy of Peru and to the High Court of Charcas.In the memorial they first set forth their loyalty, and then exposedthe deceit to which the ministers of Spain and Portugal had been subjectedby their advisers in America.  They pointed out most justlythat the treaty was damaging to both the countries concerned,*3*and that in regard to the Indians of the seven towns peculiarly unjust.Both at Charcas and at Lima their memorial (though diffuse)was favourably received, and a copy remitted to the King and Councilat Madrid.  Ibanez, in his `Republica Jesuitica', qualifies the actionof the Jesuits in this matter as a `great crime'.  Dean Funes only seesduplicity of language, but seems to excuse it in the circumstancesin which the Jesuits were placed.  Certainly, after effortsextending over almost two hundred years, it was hard on themto see seven of their most flourishing missions arbitrarily broken up,the Indians driven from their homes, and their territory occupiedby those very Portuguese who for a hundred years had been their persecutors.There was much to say in extenuation, even for `duplicity of language',when one remembers that the Jesuits alone (no matter how mistakentheir views of treatment may seem to modern eyes) stood out againstthe assumption that the Indians were a mere flock of sheep,who might be driven from their homes on any pretext,or at the exigencies of ministers at courts who lived ten thousand miles away,and were completely ignorant of the local circumstances.Whether the memorial influenced the court of Spain is hard to say;but it is certain that when, in 1752, the Marques de Valdeliriosarrived in Buenos Ayres, with him came as a commissionerto fix the boundary between the two nations of the UruguayFather Luis de Altamirano, accompanied by his secretary, Rafael de Cordoba,both members of the Order, and that the Marquis took up his lodgingin the college of the Jesuits.  There papers and memorials rained on him:one came from the Bishop of Tucuman, and one from Don Jaime de San Just,the Governor of Paraguay, with many others from people of inferior note,all in the interest of the Company.  It appears as if Valdelirios thoughtthat these memorials were inspired, for his first actionwas to publish to the priests of the seven towns the wishes of his governmentas to evacuation by the Indians of the territory.  This he didthrough the prefect of the missions, who seems to have acted in good faithin his endeavours to carry out the wishes of the Spanish court.Just at that moment Barreda, the Provincial of Paraguay,arrived in Buenos Ayres, and Valdelirios asked him his opinionas to the measures best calculated to insure the treatybeing quietly carried out.  Barreda, though all his interests were againstthe execution of the treaty, seems to have acted in good faith.He gave the sensible advice that, as the treaty had been made entirelywithout taking into consideration the difficulties of carrying it out,it could not be held a crime to ask the King for some delay.*4*He advised consulting three ex-Governors of Paraguay,who happened to be in Buenos Ayres,*5* and, lastly, that all hurry,or anything likely to excite the Indians, should be avoided;for it was possible that they, relying on their numbers and local knowledge,might be able to give much trouble even to the joint forces of both crowns.He laid before Valdelirios the condition of the reductions, telling himthat they were fertile and well cultivated,*6* and that this of itselfwould incline the Indians against migrating from their lands.Lastly, he said it was the opinion of the most experienced of the prieststhat the Indians would yield neither to arguments nor reason,for the hatred of the Portuguese had put them quite beside themselveswith fury at the idea of giving up their lands.  Valdelirios must havefound himself not in too comfortable a state.  Lodged as he wasin the college of the Jesuits, he must have felt that most of the advicewhich was so freely tendered him was biassed, and to relieve his mindhe called a council, at which the Provincial Barreda, Juan Escadon,his secretary, Altamirano, and Rafael de Cordoba appeared.  The councilrecommended prudence, and, as the majority were Jesuits, pushed their prudenceeven beyond Lowland Scotch or north of Ireland limits, for they proposedto institute a commission which, after three years' investigation,should report at Buenos Ayres on what it had found out.Commissions, royal or otherwise, have always been a trump-cardin the hands of governments, since peddling democracy,with show of noses and the like, came in and put an endto those good old methods which are as dear to-day to rulers' heartsas they have ever been since the beginning of the world,and will be whilst election, battle, fitness, talents, wealth, unfitness,or any other cause, gives power into the hands of anyone to rule.--*1* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,    tome iii., p. 45.*2* Dean Funes says `una difusa memoria'; but, then, even though friendly,    churchmen and cats rarely forego a scratch.  The proverb has it,    `Palabras de santo, un~as de gato'.*3* Though Ibanez (`Republica Jesuitica', tome i., cap. i.) says:    `This treaty caused entire satisfaction to all the world    except the English, who feared their commerce would suffer by it    (i.e., by the closing of the Colonia del Sacramento as an entry    for smuggled goods), and the Jesuits.'    Raynal, also an ex-Jesuit, but a man of far higher character    than Ibanez, says (tome iii., lib. 97):  `This treaty    met censure on both sides, the ministers in Lisbon    themselves alleging that it was a false policy to sacrifice    the Colonia del Sacramento, the clandestine commerce of which    amounted to two millions of dollars a year . . . for possessions    whose advantages were uncertain and position remote.  The outcries    were even stronger in Madrid.  There they imagined that the Portuguese    would soon rule all along the Uruguay . . . and from thence penetrate    up the rivers into Tucuman, Chile, and Potosi.'*4* Quoting the Pope who advised St. Augustine on his first mission visit    to England, to convert the natives to Christianity, to go slowly.*5* D. Martin de Echaria, Don Rafael de Menedo, and Don Marcos de Lauazabel.*6* From a letter preserved at Simancas (Legajo 7,447),    written by P. Diego Palacios to P. Luiz de Altamirano,    dated San Miguel, June 20, 1752, it appears that there were    in the territory of the seven towns plantations of `yerba' trees, cotton,    and valuable woods.--Valdelirios, who was not a fool, saw their design, and instantly despatchedAltamirano (1752) to Castillos to meet Freire de Andrade and the Portuguese,and set about drawing the new frontier line at once.Altamirano, though a Jesuit, appears (at first at any rate)to have been anxious that the treaty should be carried out.In 1752 (September 22) he wrote* from the reduction of San Borjato P. Mathias Stroner,** ordering all the Jesuits to assistin carrying out the evacuation of the seven towns.  By his adviceFreire de Andrade and Valdelirios met at Castillos, and, after having laid offsome twenty leagues of boundary line, returned respectivelyto the Colonia and to Buenos Ayres.--* Archivo de Simancas, Legajo 7,378, folio 17 -- a long and curious letter.** `Stroner' may have been `Stoner', in which case he must have been   an Englishman.  There were few English names amongst   the Paraguayan Jesuits, if one except Juan Bruno de Yorca   (John Brown of York), Padre Esmid (Smith), the supposititious `Stoner',   and the doubtful Taddeo Ennis, who, though said to be a Bohemian,   was not impossibly a Milesian.--But in the missions things were in a state bordering on revolution.When the letter from the prefect of the missions reached San Miguel,the Indians assembled outside the church,* and having learnedthe situation of the lands to which they were to move, their fury knewno bounds.  They all refused to stir, saying they had inherited their landsfrom their forefathers and by the grace of God.**  Their examplewas at once followed by three more of the towns, and virtuallya state of absolute defiance to the orders of the Spanish crown ensued.--* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil de Paraguay', etc., book v., p. 52.** They also said, in a memorial presented to the Marquis of Valdelirios   by the Provincial Barreda, preserved at Simancas (Legajo 7,447),   `That they had voluntarily made themselves vassals of the King of Spain --   despues de Christianarnos, nos hizimos voluntariamente vasallos   de nuestro Catholico Rey de Espan~a para que amparandonos con su poder   fomentase nuestra devota Christiandad.'  It was not likely, therefore,   that they would voluntarily become subject to the Portuguese,   their most bitter persecutors.--Just at this moment Altamirano, the commissary, arrived,and found the state of things most serious.*1*  The commissary Altamiranoset to work at once to place before the Jesuits of the seven townsthe danger they exposed themselves to if they refused to help himto carry out the orders of the crown.  Almost immediately on his arrivalhe wrote*2* to Don Jose de Caruajal y Lancastre to send more troops,and to the various priests*3* to destroy their powder,and cease to manufacture any more.*4*  It is most likely that,if Altamirano had no secret understanding with his brother Jesuits,his letters must have considerably amazed them, and certainlythey gave offence to the Indians, who declared he could not bea Jesuit at all.  Six hundred Indians, under a chief called Sepe Tyaragu,marched upon Santo Thome, where Altamirano had taken up his residence,with the avowed purpose of discussing whether he was a Jesuit or not,and, if the latter supposition proved correct, of throwing him intothe river Uruguay;*5* but Altamirano did not wait their coming,and returned precipitately to Buenos Ayres.  The commissionwhich had set out to mark the limits between the countries,*6*buried in the woods, or marching along the river, was absolutelyunaware of what was going on amongst the Indians till they arrivedin Santa Tecla on February 26, 1753.  The first notice that they had of itwas when they found themselves surrounded by a strong force of Indians.One of the commissaries, Don Juan de Echevarria, is known to have lefta curious account of the proceedings, from which Dean Funes, Ibanez,and most of the writers on the subject must have copied.*7*--*1* Jose Barreda, the Father Provincial of the missions,    in a curious letter under date of August 2nd, 1753,    tells the Marquis of Valdelirios that he fears not only    that the 30,000 Indians resident in the seven towns may rebel,    but that they may be joined by the Indians of the other reductions,    and that it is possible they may all apostatize and return to the woods.    Brabo, in the notes to his `Atlas de Cartas Geograficas    de los Paises de la America Meridianal' (Madrid, 1872),    gives a synopsis of this letter, which formed part of his collection,    and contained the greatest quantity of interesting papers    on the Jesuits in Paraguay and Bolivia which has ever been    brought together.  In 1872, after publishing his `Atlas',    his `Coleccion de Documentos', and his `Inventarios',    he presented his papers (more than 30,000 in number)    to the Archivo Historico Nacional of Madrid.  There they remain,    and form a rich mine for dogged scholars who have not passed their youth    on horseback with the lazo in their hands.*2* Archivo de Simancas, Legajo 7,378, folio 146.*3* Ibid.:  `Que toda la polvora que tengan los curas y misioneros    se queme o se inutilize y pierda hechandola al rio, y que en los pueblos    donde se fabrica, cese luego este labor.'*4* In another letter, also preserved at Simancas, and dated at Yapeyu,    he complains bitterly of his own suffering on the journey:    `Me moli tanto con el traqueo violento del carreton que no he podido    volver sobre mi.'  The roads to the missions seem to have been    as bad as those which produced the historical exclamation,    `O dura tellus Hispaniae!'  It is certainly the case that Ibanez,    in his `Republica Jesuitica' (Madrid, 1768), gives a very different    version of the doings of Altamirano; for he says that Rafael de Cordoba,    Altamirano's secretary, `embarked in a schooner called `La Real'    a great quantity of guns and lead for balls, packing them all in boxes,    which, he said, were full of objects of a pious nature. . . .    This,' says Ibanez, `was told me by the master of the schooner    `Jose el Ingles', a man worthy of credence.'  This is pleasing to one's    national pride, but, still, one seems to want a little better authority    even than that of `Bardolph, the Englishman'.*5* Dean Funes, book v., cap. iii., p. 54.*6* In a most curious letter (preserved at Simancas, Legajo 7,447),    the mayor and council of the reduction of San Juan write to Altamirano    upbraiding him with being their enemy, and tell him that    `St. Michael sent by God showed their poor grandfathers    (`sus pobres abuelos') where to plant a cross, and afterwards    to march due south from the cross and they would find    a holy father of the Company.'  This, of course, turned out    as the saint had foretold, and after a long day's march    they encountered the Jesuit and became Christians.*7* This account seems to have been lost, and a careful search    has not disinterred it from the Maelstrom of Simancas,    that prison-house of so many documents, without whose aid    so much of Spanish history cannot be written.--Historians, like lawyers in conveyancing, catch errors one from another,and transmit them as truths or titles to posterity.  Certain it isthat Echevarria sent for the nearest Jesuit priest to mediate,and he luckily, or unluckily, proved to be that Father Thadeus Ennis,who played so prominent a part in the futile risingwhich the enemies of the Jesuits have chosen to dignifywith the high-sounding title of the `Jesuit War'.If Father Ennis really thought the Indians could hold headto both the Spaniards and the Portuguese, or if he thoughtthat the rising would draw attention to the injustice of the treaty,is difficult to say.  Whether, indeed, he headed it himself,or if he merely accompanied the Indians as their spiritual guide,giving them now and then the benefit of his advice on matters temporal,after the fashion of the ambitious churchman of all time,*is now unknown.  Whatever his opinions were upon this matter,Father Ennis showed himself almost from the first irreconcilable.He refused to meet the commissioners, and in his placesent a `cacique' (chief) of the Indians, one Sepe Tyaragu,an official of the reduction of San Miguel.  This chief,seeing the escort of the commission was but small, `put on his boots',**and took high ground, daring to talk about the rights of man,of the love of country, and said that liberty consisted in being allowedto enjoy his property in peace, sentiments which, though admirable enoughin a white man's mouth, for men of colour are but fit for copy-books.--* His `Efemerides', or Journal, printed and mutilated by Ibanez  in his `Republica de Paraguay', gives the best account of the brief `war'  which has come down to us; it is supplemented by  the `Declaracion de la Verdad' of Father Cardiel, which deals with  the misstatements of Ibanez and others against the Jesuits.  In regard to his own share in the war, Padre Ennis says:  `Atque in exercitas curatorem, spiritualem medicum secum ire postulat.'** `Se puso las botas'.--The `cacique' firmly refused to vacate his lands, and said the King of Spain,as he lived far away, could not have understood the bearing of affairsin Paraguay.  Such arguments as these, together withthe perhaps offensive tone of the `cacique', had such effecton the commissioners that, after having threatened him with vengeance,which at the time they had no power to carry out, they both withdrewout of the territory.As Funes*1* well observes, the Spaniards had established themselvesin these parts (the River Plate and Paraguay) to obtain a limitless submissionfrom the Indians.  Any resistance drove them to fury, and excited themto take revenge.  As all the Indians' crime was their unwillingnessto quit the lands on which they had been born, it seemed a little hardto slaughter them, even before their petition to the King had been refused.Most probably all had been prepared before, for Valdelirios at onceissued an order, which he had the power to do under a sealed letterfrom the King, to the Governor of Buenos Ayres, Andonaegui,to prepare for war.  Active hostilities broke out in 1754, and Father Ennishas preserved a day-by-day account, written in priestly Latin,*2*of what took place.  After some skirmishes, which at the firstwere favourable to the Indians, who took great courage from them,*3*the first encounter of a serious nature occurred on February 24, 1754.Quite naturally, the victory was on the side of the best-armed battalions,and the Indians lost many of their best men, and their largestpiece of ordnance.*4*--*1* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay',    Buenos Ayres, etc., book v., cap. iv., p. 58.*2* Luckily Ibanez (`Republica Jesuitica de Paraguay') has not corrected    the many faults of spelling and Latinity into which Padre Ennis fell.    Those, though left in from malice, as Ibanez was a bitter enemy    of the Jesuits, serve to present the man in his habit as he wrote.    However, Ibanez has so much mutilated the text of the journal    that occasionally the sense is left obscure.*3* `Hoc itaque nuncio laeti altero ac incensi . . . Sacramento expiationis    et pane fortim roborati' (Ennis, `Efemerides').*4* Cardiel, in his `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 426, says:    `Lo mismo es 28,000 mil Indios que igual numero de muchachos.'--With varying success the war dragged on for several years,after the style of the Gaucho warfare in the River Platewhich was common twenty years ago, or that in Venezuela which obtains to-day.Alternately each party carried off the other's horses,drove each other's cattle, or, if they caught a straggler,tied his hands and cut his throat or lanced him, the party whohad lost the man protesting he was `massacred' -- a term in use even to-daywhen the party to which one's self belongs sustains reverse.For the first two years -- for wars in South America till twenty years agowere to the full as interminable as that of Troy -- Father Thadeus Enniskept his journal, faithfully chronicling all that he saw.Occasionally in a perfunctory way he says his missionwith the revolted Indians was as a priest and physicianto the souls and bodies of his flock; but now and then he sets downthe capture of a convoy of some thirty carts, or the cutting offsome messenger carrying despatches from the Generals.  In thishe sees the hand of God (put forth to help his Jesuits*1*),although he now and then complains the Indians were remissin following up any success they had.  After the first encounter,the Indians seem to have employed the immemorial guerilla tacticswhich so often waste all the strength of an army which has conqueredin the field.  Father Cardiel*2* describes the Indian army,quoting from the writing of a Spanish officer who served against them,as quite contemptible.  Their cannon were but hollow reeds,bound round with hide, which could only be fired two or three times,and carried balls a pound in weight.*3*  Some lances and bows and arrowswhich they had appeared to him more formidable.  Most of them carried bannerswith the painted figure of a saint, under whose aegis they deemed themselvessecure from cannon-balls.  Their trenches were but shallow ditches,with a few deeper holes to shelter in, but which, as Cardiel observes,served many of them for graves, as they were open to artillery,having been constructed without `an ounce of military art'.  The officer addsthat no sooner had the Indians heard the cannon than they fled,leaving almost nine hundred on the field and losing one-sixth prisoners.*4*Finally, the officer remarks with disgust that the officialchronicler of the affair `lies from first to last'*5* when he declaresthat the Indians could make any resistance against disciplined troops.With varying fortune the campaign dragged on, until in 1756the diary of Father Ennis, bad Latinity and all, comes to an abrupt conclusionat the taking of San Lorenzo, where the stout-hearted priestwas taken prisoner.  His papers fell into unfriendly hands,and were made use of by Ibanez, with the context duly distortedin various passages, and served as one of the most formidable indictmentsagainst the Jesuits in the expulsion under Charles III.--*1* `Nec tamen resipiscebat et Divinam Nemesim quamquam clare experiebatur    pro causa^ Societatis.'*2* `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 404.*3* In fact, they much resembled those `crakys of warre' which,    with the `tymmeris for helmys', Barbour, in the `Bruce',    takes notice of as the two noteworthy events of a battle    that he chronicles:        `Twa noweltyis that day thai saw,        That forouth in Scotland had bene nane.        Tymmeris for helmys war the tane,        That thaim thoucht thane off gret bewte        And alsua wondyr for to se.        The tothyr, crakys war, off wer,        That thai befor herd neuir er.'                            `The Bruce', Booke Fourteene, p. 392.*4* This was in an action in the year 1756.*5* `Miente de la cruz a la fecha'.--Although Thadeus Ennis and other Jesuits accompanied the troops,and no doubt aided much by their advice, the Indians had as a generalone Nicolas Neenguiru, styled in the Gazettes of the timethe King of Paraguay.  About this man all kinds of monstrous legendssoon sprang up.  One little lying book, entitled `Histoire de Nicolas I.,Roy du Paraguai et Empereur des Mamalus',* which bearsupon its title-page `Saint Paul',** 1756, especially excels.In that brief work of but one hundred and seventeen pages,printed on yellowish paper, and with one of the finestlittle vignettes of a basket of fruit and flowers upon its title-pagethat one could wish to see, a sort of parody of a Spanish picaresque novelin duodecimo is set forth with circumstance.--* The Mamalucos, or Paulistas, were, of course, the bitterest enemies  of everything Paraguayan, so that a King had as well been styled  of `Iceland and of Paraguay'.** If this assumes to be Sao Paulo de Piritinanga in Brazil,   it is not unlikely one of the few books published there   in the eighteenth century, if not the only one.  Happy is   the city of one book, especially when that work has   nothing of a theological character in it, even though it lies   from `la cruz a la fecha'.--Nicolas Roubioni is duly born in 1710, in a small `bourgade de l'Andalousie'bearing the name of Taratos.  The name carries conviction from the start,and pronounced a la francaise, with the accent equal uponall the syllables, is quite as Spanish as the most exigent of comic operascould possibly desire.  His father, `ancien militaire', left him aloneto educate himself as he best liked.  Arrived at eighteen years of agehe runs away to Seville, and after several adventuresin the style of those of Rinconete and Cortadillo, seen throughFrench spectacles, enters the service of a lady bearingthe well-known Spanish name of Donna Maria della Cupidita.Under the unnecessary alias of Medelino, and in the capacity of cook,he becomes the lady's lover as in duty bound.  `Chasse' from Sevilleby a jealous brother of his love, he flies for refuge to a `bourgade'(name not chronicled) some seven leagues away.  He then becomes a muleteer,and at Medina Sidonia kills a man, and, forced to flee, repairs to Malaga,where he lives peacefully ten years.  Finding life dull there,he journeys to Aragon and joins the Jesuits, and from henceforthhis future is assured.  After an interval he reappears at Huesca,and at once falls in love with `une belle espagnole', Donna Victoria Fortini,whom he courts under the guise of a gentleman of Seville,returning every night to the convent of the Jesuitsto change his clothes.  So great becomes his effronterythat under the style and title of `Comte de la Emmandes',he publicly marries `sa belle', the Jesuits either consenting,or too astounded at the fact to intervene.  Things getting hot in Huesca,he embarks for Buenos Ayres as a missionary, leaving poor Donna de la Victoria`dans une inquietude mortelle', as she might well have been.Arrived in Buenos Ayres just at the moment of the cession ofthe seven Jesuit towns, he sees his opportunity, learns Guaraniin the brief space of six or seven weeks, and joins the Indians.They naturally, having been trained to look on every foreigneroutside the Order of the Jesuits as an enemy, receive him as their King.Under the title of the `Son of the Sun and Star of Liberty' he rules them,looked on as a God.  The brief mendacious chronicle leaves him on the throne,just after having joined the empire of the Mamalucos to that of Paraguay,and promising to give the world more of his history when it comes to hand.By stories such as those contained in the mendacious little bookimprinted at St. Paul, the easy-minded public -- then, as now,always more easily impressed with lies than with the truth --was biassed against the Jesuits in Paraguay.  Father Dobrizhoffer,*who knew `King' Nicolas from his youth up, has left a very differentversion of his history, in which no Donna della Cupidita or de la Victoriaeven remotely flourishes.  Nicolas Neenguiru was bornin the township of La Concepcion, of which in after-life he roseto be the mayor.  He married an Indian woman, not `une belle Andalouse',and Dobrizhoffer says a friend of his, one Father Zierheim,had him whipped publicly for petty theft when a young man.At the time (1753) when, in company with another Indian,one Jose, mayor of San Miguel, he headed the Indian revolt,he was a man of middle age, tall, taciturn and grave, and not ill-looking,though marked across the cheek with a disfiguring scar.At no time was he even a lay brother of the Jesuit Order,as by their rules in Paraguay no Indians were ever takeneither as lay brothers or as priests.  So little was the man fearedby the authorities that, once the Indians' resistance was over,Nicolas went to the Spanish camp, was quietly heard, dismissed,and then continued in his office as the mayor of his native place.The legend sprang from a mistake in Guarani, to which perhapsa little malice gave its artful charm.  In Guarani the word `Rubicha'signifies a chief, whereas `Nfurabicha' means king.  The two,pronounced by one but ill acquainted with the language sound identical.Nothing was more likely than that the Indians should call their generaltheir chief; had they thought really of settling upon a king, it is certainthat they would have chosen one of the family of some well-known chief,and not an Indian merely appointed mayor by the Jesuits.But be that as it may, General Neenguiru, though he has leftsome interesting letters, which are preserved in the archives of Simancas,showed no capacity for generalship.**  Throughout the course of the campaignhe endeavoured to replace his want of skill by tricks and by intrigues,but of so futile a nature that they were frustrated and rendered uselessat once.  His first endeavour was to gain time, when he found himselfwith seventeen hundred men opposed to Andonaegui, Governor of Buenos Ayres,who had an army well equipped with guns, of about two thousand men.Neenguiru wrote to Andonaegui, telling him that the Indianswere ready to submit, and then, whilst waiting for an answer,set about fortifying the position which he held.  Warned by a spy,Andonaegui attacked at once, and drove the Indians from their trencheslike a flock of sheep, taking their wooden cannon, lances, and banners,and killing thirteen hundred of them.--* `Account of the Abipones', vol. i., p. 32.** The only man the Indians produced who showed any aptitude as a leader   was a chief called Sepe Tyaragu.  At his death in action in 1756   Nicolas Neenguiru succeeded to his post.--A glorious victory, and, as Father Ennis says, `to be expected, and which,had it chanced otherwise, must have covered the Spaniards and the Portuguesewith shame.'  In fact, a victory of the same kind as thosewhich since that time have been most usual when well-armed European troopshave faced half-naked, ill-armed savages, but which, of course,reflect no credit on the victor, or, at best, just as much creditas a butcher rightfully receives when he defeats a calf.But even after the victory over the Indians of Nicolas Neenguiruthe troubles of the allies were not quite at an end.The usual dissensions between allies who mutually detest each othersoon broke out, and Gomez Freire, the General of the Portuguese,only prevented a collision with the Spaniards by considerable tact.After a short campaign of a few months, the allies enteredthe rebellious towns and took possession of them all, with the exceptionof San Lorenzo, which continued to hold out.  A month or two servedto reduce it, too, and the whole territory of the seven townssubmitted to the power of the joint forces of Portugal and Spain.The struggle over, Neenguiru was quietly again reinstatedmayor of Concepcion, the bruised wooden cannon duly set upas monuments, the dead left on the plains and the `esteros'for the chimangos* and the caranchos** to gorge upon, and, law's due majestyonce more vindicated, the conquerors set about, in 1757, to trace the limitsbetween the territories of the two Christian Kings.--* `Milvago Chimango'.** `Polyhorus tharus'.  In relation to the word `tharus',   which figures as a sort of scientific (or doggerel) cognomen   to this bird, Mr. W. H. Hudson once pointed out to me that,   like some other `scientific facts', it originated in a mistake.   The Pampa Indian name of the bird is `trare'.  Molina (Don Juan Ignacio),   in his `History of Chile', happened to spell the word `thare',   instead of `trare', and then proceeded to make a dog-Latin form of it.   Thus the bird has received its present scientific name.--Most of the seven towns were half deserted, the Indians having fled for refugeto the woods,* and the commission set to work upon its labours in a desertwhich it itself had made.  Out of the fourteen thousand Indians who hadinhabited the seven flourishing towns upon the Uruguay but few remained;yet still the work of pacification and working at the boundary went on slowly,for from 1753 to 1759 nothing of consequence was done.In 1760 Ferdinand VI. died, and his son Charles III. succeeded him,and still the boundary commission worked on hopelessly in Paraguay.The Jesuits, who had worked unceasingly during the last eight yearsto annul the treaty handing the seven missions over to the Portuguese,at length, in 1761, obtained from Charles III. a treaty annullingall that had been done, and providing that the seven towns should remainpart of the dominions of the Spanish crown.--* Cardiel, `Declaracion de la Verdad', p. 430:  `. . . llego alli despues  de la fuga y desamparo de los pueblos . . . saco a los dos Padres  que estaban muy afligidos por la soledad y alboroto.'--They triumphed; but their triumph added another step towards their ruin,for the jealousy which they evoked by their persistent fightraised up much animosity towards themselves in Spain.  How great a sharethey had in the resistance of the Indians cannot be known with certainty.Papers preserved in the archives of Simancas charge themwith stirring up the Indians to resist;*1* but they are chieflyfrom Valdelirios and others, who, naturally finding resistance,put it down at once to the Jesuits, whom then, as now, it was the fashionto abuse.  The Indians themselves seem to have been perplexed,no doubt encouraged by their priests on one hand, and on the other seeingthe commissary Altamirano, himself a Jesuit, calling upon them to submit.In a pathetic letter written to the Governor of Buenos Ayres,and dated `en la estancia de San Luis, Feb. 28 de 1756',Primo Ibarrenda, of San Miguel, says:*2*  `This our writing I send to youthat you may tell us finally what is to be our lot, and that you takea resolution what it is that you shall do.  You see how that last yearthe father commissary*3* came to this our land to bother us to leave it:to leave our towns and all our territories, saying it was the will of our lordthe King:  besides this you yourself sent us a rigorous lettertelling us to burn our towns, destroy the fields, even pull down our church,which is so beautiful (`tan lindo'), and saying also that you would kill us.You also say, and therefore we ask you if it is the truth,for if it is, we will all die before the Holy Sacrament; but spare the church,for it is God's, and even the infidels would not do it any harm.'They go on to say they have always been obedient subjects of the King,and that it is impossible that his wish could be to injure them --in fact, the letter of innocent men, half civilized,and thinking justice, mercy, and right-doing were to be foundwith Governors and Kings.  Had many of the Jesuits chosen to take the field,their knowledge of the country and the vast influence that they hadupon the Indians would have made the campaign perilous enougheven for the united military power of Portugal and Spain.As it was, the miserable war dragged on for eight long years,and for result ruined seven missions where before the Indians lived happily.Then, when the fields were desolate, the villages deserted,and the Indian population half dispersed, statesmen in Spain and Portugalsaw fit to change their minds, to annul the treaty, and to passa diplomatic sponge over the ruin and the misery they had caused.--*1* In a letter (Archivo de Simancas, Legajo 7,378, folio 128),    Valdelirios, writing to the governor of Buenos Ayres,    Don Jose de Caravajal y Lancastre, says:  `Inagotables son los recursos    de los Padres para que se dilate y no se ratifique el tratado. . . .'    But he gives no proof except that they had sent petitions to the King --    surely a very constitutional thing for them to do.*2* The letter was written originally in Guarani, and a certified    translation of it exists at Simancas, Legajo 7,385, folio 13.*3* Altamirano.--Chapter X  Position of the Jesuits in 1761 -- Decree for their expulsion  sent from Spain -- Bucareli sent to suppress the colleges and drive out  the Jesuits -- They submit without resistance -- After two hundred years  they are expelled from Paraguay -- The country under the new rule --  The system of government practically unchanged`No storm is so insidious' (said St. Ignatius) `as a perfect calm,and no enemy so dangerous as the absence of all enemies.'This dangerous state of calm without an apparent enemy in sightwas the position of the Jesuits in Paraguay in 1761.  By desperateefforts and intrigues in Spain they had kept their thirty missionsfrom being mutilated; their influence amongst the Indianshad never been more absolute.  The governors of Buenos Ayres and of Paraguayhad tried a fall with them, and the honours of the strugglewere with the Jesuits.  They had succeeded in getting put into forcethe clauses of the `Laws of the Indies', which kept Spaniardsout of the Indian settlements.  Even those sent against themhad been forced to testify to their utility*1* in Paraguay.But throughout Spain and her enormous empire in America and in the Eastperpetual hostility between the Jesuits and the regular clergy had beengoing on for years.  In every portion of America the Jesuits were unpopular,the excuse alleged being their wealth and power;*2* but the real reasonwas their attitude on slavery.  After repeated grumblings of distant thunder,at length the storm broke, and the decree for the expulsion of the Jesuitsin Spain and her dominions was signed, and the order sent to Bucareli,Governor of Buenos Ayres, in June of 1767, to put it into force in Paraguay.The reasons which induced King Charles III. to expel the Jesuits,mysterious as they were, and locked up a dead secret in the royal breast,*3*may or may not have been sufficient in Spain, but could in no respecthave held good for Paraguay, where there existed little scopefor court intrigue, and where the Jesuits were far removed fromtheir fellow Spanish subjects, and occupied entirely with their mission work.Many and various have been the explanations which historians have set forthfor this decree.  Certain it is in Spain this Order had attainedto considerable power, and that in Rome the abler of their Generalsoccasionally kept the Popes in mental servitude.--*1* Don Pedro Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Ayres, who was in Paraguay in 1755,    sent there to fight the troops of King Nicolas, found, as he himself says,    `no King, and no troops, but a few half-armed Indians.'    Writing to the King, he says:  `Los Jesuitas son utiles en el Paraguay.'*2* The figures in Chapter VII. serve to show that in Paraguay, at least,    they were not exactly millionaires.  In Mexico, Palafox, the saintly    Bishop of Puebla, had set about all kinds of stories as to their riches,    but Geronimo Terenichi, an ecclesiastic sent to Mexico    to examine into the question of the Jesuits and their wealth,    after a year of residence, expressly says `they were very poor,    and laden with debt' (`eran muy pobres y estaban cargados de deudas'):    `Coleccion de los articulos de la Esperanza, sobre la Historia    del Reinado de Carlos III.', p. 435.  Madrid, 1859.*3* They were expressly proclaimed to be `ocultas y reservadas'.    Carlos III., in defence of his `occult' and `reserved' reasons,    said, `mis razones, solo Dios y yo debemos conocerlas'    (`Reinado de Carlos III.', vol. iii., p. 120.  Ferrer del Rio,    Madrid, 1856).  No doubt Carlos III. satisfied his conscience    with this dictum, but it is permissible to doubt whether the power    alluded to in such a cousin-like manner by the King was equally satisfied.--Some have accounted for the act of Charles III. as being but revengefor the tumult of Aranjuez under the ministry of Esquilace,*1*arguing that the Jesuits were in fact the authors of it, and that it wasbut the precursor of a plot to dethrone the King and place his brotherDon Luis upon the throne, as being not so liberal in his ideas.Others, again, have stated*2* that the Jesuits set about a calumnythat Charles III. was not the Queen's son by her husband,but by a lover whom they said she had.  The only reason which seems feasibleis that the King was worked on by the fear that the Order had risento too much power, and that if he did not at once take steps the monarchywould be rendered but a mere appendage of the General of the Jesuits.*3*--*1* This celebrated tumult, generally known in Spain    as `el Motin de Aranjuez', and sometimes as `el Motin de Esquilace',    occurred on Palm Sunday, 1766.  The ostensible reason    was an edict of the King (Charles III.) prohibiting the use    of long cloaks and broad-brimmed hats, which had been for long    popular in Spain.  The tumult assumed such formidable dimensions    that the Walloon Guards were unable to quell it, but two friars,    Padre Osma and Padre Cueva, in some manner were able to stem    the confusion.  The King and the court were so much disturbed    that they quitted Madrid and went to Aranjuez.  There is no proof    that the Jesuits had any hand at all in the affair.*2* Ferrer del Rio, in his history of the reign of Charles III.*3* Such, at least, several of his letters to the Pope, Clement XII.,    would seem to indicate.  It is not impossible that    the strenuous opposition which the Jesuits gave to the Inquisition    may have had something to do with their expulsion.  Some of them    went great lengths in their attacks.  P. Antonio Vieyra,    the celebrated Portuguese Jesuit, in his `Relac,ao~ Exactissima,    Instructiva, Curioza, Verdadeira, Noticioza do Procedimento    das Inquizic,ois de Portugal' (Em Veneza, 1750), is almost as severe    as Protestant writers have been against the Inquisition.    Particularly does he inveigh against the prison system of the Holy Office    (pp. 3-5, chap. i.).  In the last chapter (p. 154), Vieyra calls Saavedra,    the founder of the Portuguese Inquisition, a tyrant,    and in recounting his deeds calls him `tyranno', `cruel', `falsario',    `herege', and `ladram' (a thief), and finishes by asserting    that the tribunal invented by such a man `had its roots in hell',    and that `its ministers could not go to heaven'.--Whether it is sound policy of any government to expel a race, or sect,or order from its domains, no matter what the immediate exigenciesof the times seem to require, is a moot point.  The expulsions of the Jews,Moriscos, and Huguenots, and the dissolution of the monasteriesin the times of that true Protestant Henry VIII. of ever pious memory,do not exactly seem to have had the effect upon the countrieswhere they took place that was at first expected by their instigators.Expelled by Charles III., the Jesuits to-day in Spain have re-acquiredmuch of their influence.  So that it seems that persecution,to be effectual, must not stop on this side of extermination,and this our Lord Protector Cromwell understood full well.The Viceroy Bucareli* to whom the task of the expulsion of the Orderin the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres and of Paraguay was entrusted,was no ordinary man.**  Appointed Viceroy of Buenos Ayresafter a distinguished career of public service, he found himself,almost without warning, and without any adequate forces at his command,obliged to execute by far the most important and far-reaching taskthat had ever fallen to the lot of any Spanish Governor in Americato carry out.  But as his services had not been chiefly in America,he held the idea which at the time was generally received in Europe,that the Jesuits possessed great wealth, had bodies of trained troops,and so would resist all efforts at expulsion to the death.--* His full name was Don Francisco de Paula Bucareli y Ursua.** Brabo (`Coleccion de Documentos', etc.) says of him,   `speaking of the petty jealousies and intrigues which   the decree of expulsion evoked:  `En medio de tantas contrariedades,   crimenes y miserias destaca serena la figura de Bucareli,   no solo llevando a cabo con incansable celo su cometido,   si no atendiendo a suplir en la organizacion religiosa,   intelectual y civil los numerosos vacios que dejaba la falta   del absorbente y decisivo influjo jesuitico.'--Full of these visions, says Dean Funes,* he considered the order,which was transmitted to him from Spain, as involving serious military risk,and evidently seems to have looked on every Jesuit villageas a strong place of arms.  July 22, 1767, was the day he chose,keeping his design a secret, and preparing to strike in Corrientes, Cordoba,Monte Video, and Santa Fe, on the same day, or rather night,for the terror of the Jesuits was so great that he designedto expel them all by night.--* `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,  vol. iii., cap. viii., p. 119.--On July 2 two ships arrived in Buenos Ayres bringing the newsthat the decree had been put in force in Spain on April 2 with success.As all the crew of both the ships knew what had happened in Spain,concealment of his plan became no longer possible.  Thus, had the Jesuitspossessed either the wish or the means to make an armed resistance,they had ample time to stand on their defence.Nothing was further from their minds, though they had complete dominionover a territory as large as France, and which containeda population of over one hundred and fifty thousand souls.*1*For arms, they had as chief defence some `very long English guns,with rests if they wished to use them, which were not very heavy,and had a tolerable range.'*2*  These were the preparationsthat the Jesuits (who, not in Paraguay alone, but throughoutall the American dominions of the Spanish crown, ruled overterritories stretching from California to Cape Horn)*3* had made,and they were found alone in the missions of Paraguay, where,by a special permission of the Kings of Spain, arms were allowedfor defence against the Portuguese.--*1* Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., vol. iii., cap. viii.*2* `Tambien en algunos pueblos hay unas escopetas inglesas    muy largas con sus horquillas si se quieren usar    de ellas no son muy pesadas y tienen buen alcance'    (Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.,    vol. iii., cap. viii.).*3* There were in the year 1759 throughout the world 271 Jesuit missions,    1,542 religious houses, 61 cattle farms, 340 residences, 171 seminaries,    1,542 churches, and 22,589 Jesuits, whereof 11,293 were priests.    Of the above houses, missions, and churches, the greater portion    were in America (Ferrer del Rio, `Historia del Reinado de Carlos III.',    Madrid, 1856).    In the River Plate and Paraguay there were about 400 Jesuits,    of whom 300 were priests.  The other hundred, according to Ibanez    (`Republica Jesuitica'), were `mostly poor devils    who were in want of food, and came into the Order for a meal.'    Ibanez rarely spoke the truth, not even when it would have been    expedient to do so; and certainly amongst these `poor devils'    could not have been included Asperger, the writer on Indian medicines,    and other distinguished men who inhabited the Paraguayan missions    as lay brothers.--Bucareli, who seems to have been a timid but honest and upright man,made his first experiment upon the Jesuits of Buenos Ayres, Cordoba,and Santa Fe.  The colleges in all these places were suppressedon the same night, and without the least resistance from their occupants.He who suppresses a religious Order, takes a town or country, or, in fact,puts into operation any of the forces of the law or military power,always expects, no matter how exalted be his motives at the start,to recoup himself from the treasure of the conquered.  `Vae victis',together with the vestments of the church, the plainsong, and the saints,came as a pagan heritage to the new faith, and has been held as canon lawsince Constantine looked at the sky and thought he saw a cross.Great must have been the disgust of the Governor to find the spoil so paltry,and not to have the satisfaction even of saying that the Jesuitshad hidden all their gold, as, his own measures having been taken secretly,they had no knowledge of what was in the wind.  In the college of Cordoba,esteemed to be a mine of wealth, was found only nine thousand dollars,*which sum Ferando Fabro, the commissioner sent by Bucarelito take over the effects of the Jesuits at Cordoba, duly chroniclesin his report.--* Dean Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc.,  vol. iii., book v., cap. ix.--But if the college of Cordoba*1* proved a miserable prey,there still remained the Jesuit missions on the Uruguay and Parana,with all the riches of their fertile territory, and the enormous wealthwhich every Spaniard firmly believed the Jesuits had acquired.None of the Jesuits, either in Buenos Ayres, Cordoba, Santa Fe,Corrientes, or Monte Video having made the least resistance,but having opened wide their doors to the soldiers, who in all the townson the same day at two o'clock in the morning came to signify their expulsionto them, it was only natural to think that the same conductwould be observed in Paraguay.  But Governors and Governmentsnever seem in the least accessible to common-sense.  Almost a yearhad passed before he plucked up courage for his dangerous task.*2*He set about it with more preparation than either Cortez or Pizarro madefor the conquest of Mexico or of Peru.  Having embarked for Spainin the frigate `La Esmeralda' one hundred and fifty Jesuitsfrom the towns of Cordoba, Buenos Ayres, Monte Video, and Santa Fe,he prepared to march upon the missions, when a suspicion of resistancecaused him to take precautions which the result proved quite ridiculous.He sent two hundred of the best of the militia of Asuncionto occupy the fords upon the Tebicuari,*3* and a body of equal strengthto occupy the port of San Miguel.  All these measures being takenfor his safety, the conqueror embarked upon May 24, taking with himthree companies of grenadiers and sixty dragoons.  He disembarkedat the town of Salto on the Uruguay, and from thence despatchedCaptain Don Juan Francisco de la Riva Herrera to occupy the townsupon the Parana.  Don Francisco de Zabala was sent to seize six of the townsupon the Uruguay.  Bucareli himself, with several hundred men,marched upon Yapeyu,*4* the southernmost of all the mission towns.The Jesuits, however, gave no trouble to any of the troops,and even stopped the Governor from gathering any laurels, however withered,with which to crown his arms.--*1* The fine library was dispersed, and many priceless MSS. treating of    the discovery and conquest, and of expeditions by the Jesuits    amongst tribes of Indians now extinct, were lost.  Nothing seems    to have been preserved except matter which the dispersers thought    might prove incriminating to the Jesuits.  It is a well-known principle    to judge and condemn a man, and then to search for evidence against him.    The books were kept in a place known as La Granja de Santa Catalina,    and a man of letters, Dr. Don Antonio Aldao, was charged    to catalogue and remit them to the capital.  Dean Funes says    (book v., cap. ix., p. 156) that he complied with his instructions    (`verifico/la felizmente y con arreglo a sus instrucciones'),    but, anyhow, most of the books were lost.  It is a common phrase    amongst doctors, `The operation was entirely successful,    but the patient unfortunately succumbed.'  Amongst the books    was the celebrated `Monita Secreta', used by Ibanez in his charges    (after the expulsion) against the Jesuits.*2* Dean Funes (`Ensayo de la Historia Civil', vol. iii., cap. viii.)    seems to have gauged the feelings of the Governor when he says:    `Temblo de susto Bucareli considerando en riesgo una conquista,    que debia aumentar su gloria y su fortuna.'  `Su fortuna' is delicious,    and shows your true conqueror's melancholy.*3* The Tebicuari forms the northern boundary between    the territory of Misiones and the rest of Paraguay.  It is a large river,    and in my time (1872-1875) was bridgeless, and had to be crossed    in canoes, whilst the horses swam, or were towed behind the canoes    with ropes.*4* Yapeyu was the largest of all the missions.  The name signifies a chisel    in Guarani.--As he advanced from town to town, the priests, on his arrival at each place,although living in the midst of Indians, some of whom were armed,and many of whom had served the King of Spain in various wars,and all of whom looked on the Jesuits almost as gods,came out and peacefully gave up the keys of all their houses,and submitted quietly to be made prisoners and be carried off in chainsfrom the territories which they and their order had civilized and ruled overalmost two hundred years.  Seventy-eight Jesuits and their provincialswere sent prisoners to Buenos Ayres, and their places all filled upwith other priests taken from different Orders, and none of whomhad any experience in mission-work.  As Dean Funes tartly writes,the miracle that Bucareli wished, but scarcely dared to hope for,had taken place.  The Jesuits, in Paraguay, at least, by their conductin their last public act, most amply vindicated their loyaltyto the Spanish crown.  Nothing would have been easier,depleted as the viceroyalty was at the time of troops,*than to have defied the forces which Bucareli had at his disposal,and to have set up a Jesuit State, which would have taxedthe utmost resources of the Spanish crown to overcome.No doubt the very facility with which Bucareli carried out his plansconfirmed him in his own mind of their expediency, for men in generalare prone to think that right which they accomplish with success.However, be that as it may, he returned in triumph to Buenos Ayreson September 16, having expended in his expedition less than four months.So in a quarter of a year the Jesuits, after more than two hundredyears of rule, were all expelled from Paraguay.--* Bucareli, in a letter to El Conde de Aranda (Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos  relativos a/ la Expulsion de los Jesuitas', Madrid, 1872),  says in reference to the perils by which he imagined himself surrounded:  `El misero diminuto estado de la tropa, por el atraso  de sus pagas y la falta que encontre/ de caudales en estas cajas,  era una urgencia que me atormentaba.'--They made no fight, nor offered any resistance, letting themselves be takenas a butcher takes a sheep, and that surrounded as they wereby a population of upwards of one hundred and fifty thousand souls,cut off by countless leagues from the outside world, defended on three sidesby virgin forests and by marshes hardly passable to European troops.One word from the Provincial would have set the missions in a blaze.A word would have brought clouds of horsemen -- badly armed, 'tis true,but knowing every foot of marsh and forest, all the deep-beaten tracks whichwind in the red earth across the lonely plains, the passes of the rivers,springs, natural fastnesses, and having the varied knowledge of a countrywhich of old made Border horsemen and Northumbrian prickers formidableupon the Scottish marches -- into the field.The dogged Paraguayan Indians, ancestors of the infantry which,under Lopez,*1* died so bravely under the fire of the Brazilian guns,would, in their red cloaks and scanty linen clothes,have marched from `capilla'*2* and from mission againstthe enemies of the `father-priests'.  Seventy-eight Jesuitswere marched off to Buenos Ayres, and then shipped off to Europe*3*to join their fellows, who had been brought togetherby the ministers of the most liberal King who ever filled the Spanish thronefrom every quarter of the world.  Having expelled the Jesuits,Bucareli was bound by the exigencies of his positionto calumniate them.  Perhaps, as an official, hidebound in his beliefin the inalterable right of Governments to commit injustices,he believed all that he wrote.  For the welfare of humanity, one could hopehe knew all that he wrote was false.  What hope is there left for mankindas long as addle-headed, honest men see naught but justicein whatever order they receive?  Better a thousand times a roguewho knows he is a rogue than a good, well-intentioned, blundering manquite unaware he is a fool.--*1* This war, undertaken by a fool (Lopez) against enormous odds,    served to show what a people even when in the wrong, and in a bad cause,    can do when it believes itself to be fighting for national liberty.    As a matter of fact, Paraguayan liberty was not threatened    for an instant, and Lopez declared war against both    Brazil and the Argentine Republic out of mere ambition    to be a second Napoleon.  His solitary qualifications for the character    were that, like his prototype, he was fat and loved women.    The war commenced in 1865 and finished in 1870, and left the country    almost a desert.  So lonely was it, that I have often in those days    seen tigers calmly walk across a road in mid-day,    and a shout or a pistol-shot but little quickened their movements.*2* `Capilla' was the name given in Paraguay to some of the smaller villages    which had a chapel, the chapel (`capilla') being more important    than the houses.*3* El V. P. Jose Pignatelli, in his `La Compan~ia de Jesus    en su Extincion y Restablecimento', says that the Paraguayan Jesuits    were all sent to Faenza.--But, still, he had to justify himself either upon his own accountor for the benefit of that posterity to conciliate whichso many public men have paltered with the truth.  So his first carewas to extract a letter from thirty Indians whom he chose to dignifywith the title of the mayors of the thirty towns, first having,as he says himself in a letter to the Conde de Aranda,the minister of Charles III., dressed them in the Spanish fashion,and treated them in such a way that they might know how muchtheir lot had been improved.*  The letter, written originally in Guarani,**bears upon every line of it the dictation of the Governor.After a fine paragraph of salutations, it goes on to give the Kingmany and repeated thanks (`muchas y repetidas gracias') for having senthis Excellency Captain-General Don Francisco Bucareli, `who has fulfilled,for the love of God and for the love of your Majesty, all the just orderswhich your Majesty laid to his charge, aiding our poverty,and clothing us like gentlemen.'  Most people, even the heathen,like those who help their poverty and clothe them in the garb of gentlemen.It had not occurred to the poor Indians that the fine clothesmight turn out liveries.  The mayors all sign their Indian names,which seems to give the lie to the accusation that the Jesuitskept them ignorant.  The letter, dated Buenos Ayres, March 10, 1768,seems to show that the Indians, be they who they might have been,were not free agents at the time they wrote.  The Indians' letterduly despatched, the Governor indited a report, in whichhe fairly and with circumstance reiterates all the old chargesagainst the Jesuits in Paraguay which the inventive brain of Cardenashad first conceived; but to them he adds several little touches of his own,which show he had some observation and an imaginative mind.--* `Carta del Gobernador de Buenos Ayres (Bucareli) al Comte de Aranda'.  Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos Relativos a la Expulsion de los Jesuitos',  p. 8, Madrid, 1872:  `Les hice vestir a la Espan~ola  asistiendolos y tratandolos de modo que conozcan la mejora  de su suerte. . . .'** Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 101.  The letter is headed   `I. H. T., Ore Rey Nitu Don Carlos Tercero'.--Amongst his numerous letters to Aranda and to the King,one dated Buenos Ayres, October 14, 1768,* contains the fullest accountof his proceedings in the missions and of his views (or of what he thoughtto be his views) about the work in which he was engaged.Time was of small account in 1768 either in Paraguay or in Madrid,so Bucareli relates with some prolixity all that he did,with comments, movements of troops, regrettable occurrences-- as when his soldiers let themselves be surprised and lost their horses --and now and then scraps of morality and theology, which shows quite plainlythat the art of writing maundering despatches is not so new as optimistsmay have supposed.  Quite in the manner of a modern special correspondent,he sets down all that he suffered from the weather; that itrained incessantly, and, marvellous to tell, that after rain the rivers rose,and gave him difficulty to cross.  The roads were bad,provisions scarce and dear, and now and then wild Indians `massacred'an outpost of his men, whilst his brave fellows, when God willed it,occasionally `chastised' the infidel, and by the grace of Heavenslew no small number of them.  Still, in the monstrous farrago of words,extending to some sixteen pages of close print, he lets us seehe was a man of some capacity, but leaves it doubtful whetherhe really thought he was engaged upon a noble work, or if he wrote ironically,or if his only object was to satisfy his conscience and his King.But making much of little difficulties is but to be expectedfrom a leader of an expedition or from a General in the field.  Without it,how could they justify their existence, or prove to the world at largethat they were needed, or but more important than a mere ceremony?**--* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 185.** Ceremonies, no doubt, have their uses in enslaving mankind.  A courtier   once said to a Spanish King, `Your Majesty is but a ceremony yourself.'--When the land troubles were got over, and Bucareli, having arrived at Yapeyu,embarked upon the river, the very winds proved contrary,so that it took him many days to arrive at Candelaria, which port he reachedupon August 27, 1768.  But before quitting Yapeyu the Governor madea solemn feast, riding himself before his grenadiers, whose caps, he says,caused much amazement, the Indians never having seen such headgearin their lives.  The difficulties of his journey over, the Jesuitsdispossessed and sent down-stream to be remitted home, Bucareli in his letternext deals with questions of religion, about which he shows himselfas well informed as all the Spanish conquerors seem to have beenin the New World.  If for the dogma of the faith he was a bar of iron,for `cold morality', as Scottish preachers of the perfervid typeused to refer to it, he was most keen.  The Indians' clothes,especially the graceful `tupoi' worn by the women, shocked him exceedingly.It was impossible to touch upon it without an outrage upon modesty.*Masculine virtue is a most precarious thing, but little, if at all,more stable than its female counterpart; therefore perhaps the Governorwas right not to expose his soldiers to temptation, so he did well,as he informs us, in serving out clothes which obscured their charms,or perhaps hid them quite from view.  `Such tyrannies,'**says the modest Governor, `occasioned many offences against God,and frequent illnesses and epidemics.'  The sentence is a little doubtfulin its meaning, for if a scantiness of women's dress occasionedillnesses and epidemics amongst the population of a town,Belgravia and Mayfair should surely be the most unhealthy spots on earth;though even there, I verily believe, no more offences against God occurthan amongst the Moors, whose women show only their eyesto the shrinking gaze of easily offended men.--* Letter to Aranda:  Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 196:  `Y las mujeres en tal extremo, que es impossible demostralo  sin faltar a la modestia.'** `Semejantes tiranias'.--As in duty bound, Bucareli kept for the end of his despatcha rehash of all the old charges made against the Jesuits.They kept the Indians in slavery, would never let them learn Spanish,and were themselves inordinately rich.  The first two accusationsFather Jose Cardiel, in his `Declaracion de la Verdad',abundantly disproves.*  The last the Governor disproves himself;for had he found much treasure he most assuredly would have made hasteto send it to the King.  What he did find, a reference laterto Brabo's inventories will show, and the same source discloses all the wealththe richest Order in the world, according to their enemies,took with them in their involuntary journey back to Spain.All being finished in the missions and the Jesuits expelled,Bucareli found himself obliged to institute some systemfor the government of the Indian population, which he had deprivedboth of its spiritual and of its temporal guides.--* P. 222:  `Y teniendo presente que por lo que mira a este punto resulta  de los informes que solo hablan estos Indios su idioma natural,  pero que no es prohibicion de los PP. Jesuitos, sino por el amor  que tienen a su nativo lenguage pues en cada uno de los pueblos  han establecido esculas de leer y escriber en lengua espan~ola,  y que por este motivo se encuentra un numero grande de Indios  muy habiles en escribir (dos de ellos etan copiando hora esto  que yo escribo y de mejor letra que la mia).'  Also pp. 223-225, etc.--The Jesuits' government having been so bad, according to his own despatch,the Indians having been kept in such a miserable state, their educationhaving been so neglected, and, above all, their women having been dressedin such light attire that Bucareli could not with modestyeven describe their dress, it might have seemed but natural thathe should have evolved some system of government differing in all respectsfrom that he had destroyed.  So far from that, in his instructionsto his interim successor, dated at Candelaria,* August 23, 1768,he practically followed slavishly all the policy which the Jesuitshad pursued.  He ordered Captains Riva Herrera and Bruno de Zavala, to whomthe arrangements were committed, to see that the Indians were instructed`in the true knowledge of our holy faith', a work which the Jesuits,whatever might be their faults, had not neglected to insure.After some platitudes as to the vivifying effects of free and open trade,and an injunction to his captains to take care the Indian girlswere decorously and virtuously dressed, he launched into a sermonabout honest work, which, as he said, would make the Indians rich,happy, and virtuous, and alone could ever make a kingdom prosper;in fact, he used almost precisely similar language to that to-day usedby a European Governor in Africa when about to make a people slaves.On the whole, however, his instructions were wise and liberal,and had they been carried out in the same spirit, and with fidelity,the Indians might have long continued in the same half-Arcadian,half-Christian state in which the Jesuits left them, and to whichit seems they could attain, but not go farther without exposureto that vivifying commerce without which nations cannot prosper,but with which the greater portion of their citizens must remain ever slaves.--* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 200.--The instructions given, he left the missions never to return,leaving behind him the reputation of an honest man, having made,as it would appear, no money during his sojourn in their territories.On October 20, 1768, he wrote from Buenos Ayres to Aranda, telling him thathis work was done, and asking him as a particular favour to implore the Kingto give him some employment `out of America, and particularlynot under either the secretaryship or the Council of the Indies.'*1*Thus it appears that either the work in which he had been engagedwas uncongenial to him, or he mistrusted the future and the Indianswhen the Jesuits' sheltering hands had been withdrawn,and thought the King might blame him for what was sure to come.One passage in his letter of instructions shows that the antique,but still current, fashion of going to any length to obtain a countryin which are situated even supposititious gold-mines had its influenceeven with such an honest man as Bucareli was.  He specially enjoinsupon the officials left in charge `to find out from what quarterthe Indians of those towns extract those pieces of the precious metals whichthey sometimes bring to their priests.'  So that the fable of the false minesstarted by Cardenas, although a thousand times disproved,still lingered in the minds of those who could not understandwhat motive except that of growing rich could cause the Jesuitsto bury themselves in the recesses of the Paraguayan woods.  The releasefrom things American and under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indiesdid not come to Bucareli for almost two more years, during which timehe struggled manfully with the affairs of the Jesuit missions,repelled the Chaco Indians on one side, and on the other implored for troopsto defend the island of Chiloe against the heretic English, who at that timeappear to have been meditating the advancement of their empirein the extremest south.  One curious letter was reservedfor Bucareli to indite before he quitted Buenos Ayres for the last time.On January 15, 1770, he sent a long declaration signed bythe celebrated Nicolas Neenguiru and other Indians,giving an account of the part played by him in the abortive resistancewhich he made against the cession of the seven towns.  This is the last timethat Nicolas, the `King' of Paraguay and `Emperor of the Mamelucos',appears in any document as far as I can find.  His name at one timewas well known in Paraguay, the River Plate and Spain, and served to fathermany lies upon; and at the last, the Jesuits gone, he seems to have turnedagainst them, and said all that was required by Bucareli to get up his case.It appears from Bucareli's letter that the family of the Neenguiruhad been well known in the missions from the time of Cardenas.In 1770*2* we find him shorn of his kingly and imperial dignities,the mayor of Concepcion in Paraguay, tall, taciturn, with long, lank hair,and much respected by his brother Indians, who held his stirrup for himwhen he got upon his horse.  To find him in the humourto give tongue about the Jesuits was a trump-card in Bucareli's hand,for if it could be proved that in 1750 they had resistedthe forces of the crown of Spain, the public, always anxious to believe a lie,would naturally applaud the action of the King in their expulsionfrom his territories.  Nicolas, who seems to have been but a poor creatureat the best, testified that everything which he had doneas General of the Indians was by the order of Fathers Limp and Ennis,and that he was a poor Indian who did but that which he was told.He finished up his testimony with thanks to the good Kingfor having taken him out of the power of the Jesuits, and kept himin his post of mayor at Concepcion.  In fact, all was the same to himas long as he was left with his alcalde's staff.*3*--*1* `Y sobre todo, fuera de la America y libre de Secretaria y Consejo    de Indias.'  Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc.:    Letter of Bucareli to Aranda, p. 231.*2* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', etc., p. 280.*3* The alcaldes of Indian villages usually have a long cane    with a silver head, like those formerly carried by footmen,    as a badge of their office.  In remote places I have seen them,    with their canes in their hands, a battered tall hat upon their heads,    a linen jacket and trousers, and barefooted, riding on an ox,    and thought that they served to maintain the majesty of the law    quite as well as if they had had stuff gowns, horsehair wigs,    and had been seated on a sack of wool.--Upon August 14, 1778, Bucareli sailed for Spain, leaving Don Juan Jose Vertizas his successor in the viceroyalty of the provinces of the River Plate.The missions were all placed under the care of friars of the begging Orders,chiefly Franciscans, and the system of the Jesuit governmentwas left unchanged.  In 1771, writing from San Lorenzo (el Escorial) in Spain,Bucareli, who seemed fated never to escape from the affairs of Paraguay,sends a long constitution for the thirty towns which follows all the Jesuits'rules of government to the last tittle of their policy.  Brabo has preservedthe document, which runs to forty-seven pages of close print in its entirety.A carefully thought-out and well-conceived digest of a constitutionit most certainly is, and yet it follows to the most minute particularthe policy the Jesuits laid down.Dean Funes* seemed to see that the flattering of Nicolas Neenguiruand the other Indian chiefs was an entire affair of artifice,and that it was but a mere crowning of the victims who were destinedto be sacrificed.  It may be that the constitution made by Bucareliat the Escorial was similarly but a blind to keep the Indians quiettill the Government had time to exploit them at its ease.Still, Bucareli in all his actions seems to have been an honest man;one of those honest, narrow-minded men who have sown more misery in the worldthan all the rogues and scoundrels since the flood.  Be all that as it may,his constitution in a thousand ways recalled the Jesuits' polityin their days of rule.  In a former chapter** I have pointed outa curious instance in which this constitution traverses entirelystatements made by the Jesuits' enemies that their exclusive policy was fortheir own ends, and not, as they alleged, for the protection of the Indians.But there are other instances quite as remarkable which show that the Jesuitsnot only had grasped perfectly what the best course of treatment wasfor their subjects, but that the official mind of Bucareli,trained as he was, so to speak, in the strictest sect of Pharisees,and prejudiced against the Jesuits in every way, yet discerned clearlyas an honest man that the plan they had laid down was the most suitablefor future rulers to pursue.--* Vol. iii., book v., cap. viii., p. 130 (`Ensayo de la Historia Civil  del Paraguay', etc.):  `Los Caciques y corregidores que acompan~aban  a Bucareli, habian sido alhagados por todos los artificios de sugestion.  Esto a/ la verdad, no era mas que coronar las victimas,  que se destinaban al sacrificio.'** Chapter IX.--At the time of forming his constitution he had been gone but scarce a yearfrom Buenos Ayres, and yet he writes* complaining bitterly of whatwas happening in the missions of Paraguay.  He points out that all his troublewill have been in vain `if the Governor and his lieutenants are not stimulatedto address themselves to the service of God and of the King,with that zeal which everyone should impart to his duty.'Then, after a puff preliminary of the beauty of freedom, human and Divine,he sets forth how the Indians are in future to be ruled.First, as in duty bound, he points out that anything savouring of communismis against the laws of Heaven and of man; that the Indiansin their semi-communism were really slaves, the industriousworking for the idle, and so forth; that their clothes were scanty;that they were not allowed to freely mix with Spaniards, and were kepta race apart.  Then like a prudent statesman having made his apologia`pro existentia sua', and blown off much virtuous steam, he comes to business,and business, as we know, is the great soberer of theorists,no matter on what side they theorize.--* Brabo, p. 304.--After the article to which I have referred in Chapter IX. comes thismost curious paragraph, taken in connection with the inalienable right which,according to himself, the Indians had of free communicationwith the outer world:*1*  `And because I am informed that many Indianswho have been absent in the army of the Portuguese, and have residedfor lengthened periods in Rio Pardo, Viamont and other parts,have returned to their towns, you will take care that all thesewith their families shall be removed to those (towns) eitherin the interior or distant from those frontiers, as it is not convenientthat they should remain on them (the frontiers) or close to them;and thus you will proceed successively with the Indians who return,without leaving one, in order to avoid any chance of communication,which might be most prejudicial.'  Surely a satire onhis own abuse of the Jesuits for keeping the Indians mewed up from intercoursewith the outside world.  It may be that he had perceived the Indianswere not fit to hold their own; indeed, it is certain he had done so,for on p. 326 he writes, `It is not convenient to leave them (the Indians)entire liberty,*2* for it would be in the extreme fatal and prejudicialto their interests, because the astuteness and sagacity of the Spaniardswould triumph easily over their rusticity.'  `Sagacity' isan ingenious euphuism, and might well be used with good effectin the like circumstances, when occasion serves, to-day.But as no single article of any document set forth by any Governmentcan be straightforward and single in its purpose, and as all laws are madewith an eye upon some party presently in power, after the paragraphjust quoted, on the next page occurs the following sentenceunder the head of `Commerce with the Spaniards is to be free'.*3*`It is laid down that between the Indians and the Spaniardscommerce should be free, in order that mutual dealingsshould unite them in friendship.'  Therefore to the ordinary mindit is impossible to make out what really was intended,and whether commerce was to be free or not.  Those little differences apart,the constitution ran entirely upon Jesuit lines.  That semi-communismwhich was so prejudicial during the Jesuits' rule was formally re-organizedin chapter iv. of the constitution (p. 343) the instant that their powerwas placed in other hands.  Even the prohibition to the Spaniardsto enter the Jesuit towns, and reside there, was formally kept upin chapter iii., with the sole alteration that for three months of the yearthey might reside amongst the Indians on certain well-defined conditionsmost prolixly set forth.  So that it will be seen that,if the Jesuits did ill, as usual, any ill they did was carefully perpetuatedby their successors, and, quite as naturally, all that they strove to doin favour of the Indians was most carefully undone.--*1* Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 320:  `Y porque estoy    informado que muchos Indios de los que se habian ausentado    con las tropas Portuguesas, y que han residido por gran tiempo    en el Rio Pardo, Viamont, y otras partes se han restituido a sus pueblos,    ciudaran . . . de que todos estos con sus families seran traslados    a los mas interiores o distantes de aquellas fronteras    por no ser conveniente se mantengan en ellas o sus inmediaciones,    y asi en lo sucesivo lo ejecutaran . . . con los Indios que se restituyan,    sin dejar alguno, para evitar todo motivo de communicacion    que puede ser muy prejudicial.'*2* `No conviene dejarles una entera libertad, que seria por extremo    fatal y prejudicial a/ sus intereses pues la astucia y sagacidad    de los espan~oles triumfaria facilemente de su rudeza.'*3* Brabo, `Bucareli's Instructions', p. 327:  `Que el commercio    de los espan~oles ha de ser libre.'--Chapter XI  ConclusionIt is the fashion of some to say that history, of whatever nature,can but be written dispassionately at a period sufficiently removedfrom the events of which it treats to have allowed the heat of passionto evaporate.  This is as false as almost every other dictum which mentake on trust, forgetting that to have passed into the proverbial stagea saying must have been foolish at the start, in order that itshould have got itself commended by the majority of mankind.The heat of passion never evaporates in regard to eventswhich at the epoch of their acting caused great controversies.From writings of contemporaries the coolest-headed take a bias,in the same way that men unconsciously pass on the microbes of diseaseto their best friends.  Only from inventories and rolls of court,State Papers and the like is it possible to get unbiassed matter,and even then figures, those chief deceivers of mankind,can be well cooked for or against, according to the bias of the manwho draws them up.  Still, when they are drawn up by enemies, they oftenquite unwittingly show out the truth.  In a letter dated October 30, 1768,Bucareli sends a list to Aranda of the effects of many of the Jesuitstaken from Paraguay and sent by him to Spain.  The list itself speaks volumesin defence of the Jesuits in Paraguay.  Whatever may have been their faults,the Governor himself (or even Charles III.) could not have chargedupon the captured priests that they had got together a large stock of propertyduring their mission life.*1*  The first upon the list, P. Pedro Zabaleta,took ten shirts, two pillow-cases, two sheets, three pocket-handkerchiefs,two pairs of shoes, two pairs of socks, and a pound and a half of snuff.The others were in general less well set up with shirts,*2* some fewhad cloaks, and one (P. Sigismundo Griera) a nightcap; but all of themhad their snuff, the only relic of their luxurious mission life.Manuel Vergara, their Provincial, testifies in a paper sent with the listthat most of the clothes were taken from the common stock,and all the snuff.  What sort of treatment they endured upon their passagein the two frigates `San Fernando' and `San Nicolas' is quite unknown,but certainly their luggage could not have been in the way;and for their snuff, no doubt they husbanded it with careduring the long two months, which in those days was thought a record run.*3*In the missions which they had so long tended with such care,giving their muddle-headed love to the Indians in their Machiavelian way,all was confusion in the space of six short months.Dean Funes and Don Feliz de Azara*4* are the only two contemporary writerswho treat of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Paraguayoutside the official world.  The Dean, a man of the old school,was kindly and humane, well educated, and, having been brought up in Tucumanamongst an Indian population, looked on the Indians in a kindly wayas fellow-creatures, though differing in essential points from raceswhich had been for centuries exposed to civilization and its effects.His description of the Indians has for veracity and observationnot often been surpassed.  `Those natives*5* (he says) are of a pale colour,well made, and well set up.  Their talent and capacityare capable of much advancement.  Though they lack invention in themselves,yet are they excellent in imitation.  Idleness seems natural to them,although it may be more the effect of habit than of temperament;their inclination towards acquiring knowledge is decided,and novelty has its full effect upon their minds.  Ambitious of command,they acquit themselves with honour in the positions to which they may attain.Eloquence is held amongst them in the first place, and avarice in no respectdegrades their minds.  An injurious word offends them more than punishments,which they solicit rather than undergo the former outrage.Incontinency in their women they look upon but with indifference,and even husbands are little sensible to acts of infidelity.Conjugal love has but slight influence upon the treatmentwhich they give their wives.  Fathers of families care for their sonsbut little.  The serenity of mind of all these Indiansin the midst of the greatest troubles is without equal in the world;never a sigh with them takes off the bitterness of suffering.'--*1* The Paraguayan Jesuits were allowed to take away    all their personal property, and it appears that they did so.*2* Cayetano Ibarguen had only two, P. Lorenzo Balda three, and so on    (Brabo, `Coleccion de Documentos', p. 388).*3* So late as 1818 Rengger, in his `Essai Historique sur la Re/volution    du Paraguay', etc., talks of arriving in Buenos Ayres    `apre\s un court trajet de soixante jours.'  From thence to Corrientes    he took seven weeks, but does not say if the passage was considered    short or long.*4* Funes, `Ensayo Critico de la Historia Civil del Paraguay', etc.;    Don Feliz de Azara, `Descripcion y Historia del Paraguay', etc.;    and also `Memorias sobre el estado rural del Rio de la Plata en 1801'.*5* `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', vol. i., book ii., p. 341.--No one who knows the Indians but must confess that Dean Funeshad made a study of their character deeper than is his own.Azara, on the other hand, was a man of science; his booksupon the birds and quadrupeds of Paraguay still hold the field,and are esteemed for curious and minute observation and accuracyas to scientific facts.  The man himself was an extremelyable writer, a captain in the Spanish navy, and well educated.For twenty years he served in Paraguay and in the River Plate,with credit to himself and profit to the country which he served.Educated as he was in the school of the Encyclopaedists,amongst the strictest of the pharisees of Liberalism,to him the very name of Jesuit was anathema.  After the fashion of his kind,he seemed unable to distinguish between the scheming Jesuitsat European courts and the simple and hard-working missionaries in Paraguay.All were anathema, and therefore all their system was repugnant to him;and though a kindly man, as is set forth abundantly in all his works,he never paused to think that there could be a difference between his idealfree Liberal citizen, voting and exercising all his right of citizenshipin a free commonwealth, after the fashion of a dormousefreely exercising his natural functions in the receiver of an air-pump,and a simple Indian of the Paraguayan woods.Freedom to him, as it has been to many theorists, was an abstract thing,possessing which a man, even though starving, must in its mere possessionfind true happiness.  He never paused to inquire, as even Bucareli did,if the mission Indians could hold their own under free competitionwith the `sagacity' of the surrounding Spanish settlers.Therefore he is the authority whom Liberals always quoteagainst the system of the Jesuits.  When he inveighs againsttheir semi-communism, the modern Liberal claps his hands,and sees a kindred Daniel come to judgment, as he would do to-dayif in Damaraland the Germans set up a Socialistic settlementamongst the negro tribes, and some Liberal economist denounced itwith an oath.  Azara quite forgets that, as Dean Funes says,the `sentiment of property was very weak amongst the Indians,'and that their minds were `not degraded by the vice of avarice.'Still, Azara was an honest man -- a keen observer and impartial,as far as his upbringing and the tenets he had imbibed in youthpermitted him to be.  Upon the question of the Jesuitshe was entirely prejudiced, although few have stood up more stoutlyto condemn the faulty system which the Spaniards pursued towards the Indiansin both Americas.  But on account of his political proclivitiesAzara is quite silent as to the state into which the missions fellafter the Jesuits had been expelled.  No doubt he thought that,once their faulty system was removed, the Indians would soon becomewhat he judged civilized, and hold their own with those around them,though of another race and blood.Funes, upon the contrary, fully exposes all the rapacity and incompetenceof the new shepherds left by Bucareli to guard the Jesuits' sheep.`Ignorant* of Guarani, and without patience to acquire it,confusion reigned in the missions as in a tower of Babel,'and he goes on to say `an imperious tone of order was substitutedfor the paternal manner (of the Jesuits), and as a deaf man who cannot hearhas to be taught by blows, that was the teaching they (the Indians)had to bear.'  Shortly, he says, `a wall of hatred and contemptbegan to rise between the Indians and their masters; and the priests,who by the virtue of their office ought to have been the ministers of peace,being without influence to command . . . and not entirely irreproachablein their ministry . . . added themselves to the discord and dissensionwhich arose.'--* Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., book v., cap. viii., p. 133.--Bucareli, as soon as he knew what was going on, advised that all the priestsappointed by himself should be replaced by others.  This accordingly was done,but it was even then too late:  the missions went from bad to worse;of the vast quantities of cattle few were left; the priests followedthe example of their prototypes Hofni and Phineas, went about armed,took Indian mistresses, and neglected all religious duties,treating the Indians after the fashion of the Spaniards in the settlements.Thus the Arcadian life, which had subsisted more than two hundred years,in the brief space of two short years was lost.The vast estancias, in which at the expulsion more thana million head of cattle pastured,* were but bare plains,in which the cattle that were left had all run wild or perished from neglect.Wild beasts roamed round the outskirts of the half-deserted towns.A dense low scrub of yatais and of palmettos invaded all the pasture-lands,and in the erstwhile cultivated fields rank weeds sprang up, and chokedthe crops which in the Jesuits' times had made the mission territoriesthe most productive of the American possessions of the Spanish crown.The churches were unserved, and in the evening air no morethe hymns resounded, nor did the long white-robed processionsheaded by a cross pass to the fields to peaceful labour,marshalled by their priests.  The fruit-trees round the missionswere either all cut down for firewood or had degenerated,and the plantations of the Ilex Paraguayensis,** from which they madetheir `yerba', which had been brought from the up-country forestswith vast pains, were in decay, and quite uncultivated.--* Brabo, `Inventarios', Appendix, p. 669.** Demersay (`Histoire du Paraguay'), writing in 1847,   says of the mission of La Cruz he saw a few trees still standing   in a miserable state.--The Indian population had almost disappeared within the spaceof eight-and-twenty years.*  The Guaranis collected from the woodswith so much effort to the missionary, then guided down the Paranaby the most noble and self-sacrificing of their priests, Ruiz Montoya,and after that redeemed with blood from the fierce Mameluco bands,had shrunk away before the baneful breath of unaccustomed contactwith the civilizing whites.--* Funes, `Ensayo de la Historia Civil', etc., book vi., cap. viii., p. 395.--The simple ceremonious, if perhaps futile, mission-life had withered upat the first touch of vivifying competition -- that competitionwhich has made the whole world gray, reducing everything and everyoneto the most base and commonest denominator.The self-created goddess Progress was justified by works,and all the land left barren, waiting the time when factoriesshall pollute its sky, and render miserable the European emigrants,who, flying from their slavery at home, shall have found it waiting for themin their new paradise beyond the seas.The world, it would appear, is a vast class-room, and its Creatorbut a professor of political economy, apparently unableto carry out his theories with effect.  Therefore, to us,the Western Europeans, he has turned for help, and upon usdevolved the task of extirpating all those peoples upon whomhe tried his 'prentice hand.  On us he laid injunctions to increase at home,and to the happier portions of the world to carry deathunder the guise of life unsuitable to those into whose lands we spread.Let those made cruel by the want of sympathy with menthat the mere poring over books so often superinduces in the mindprotest when judging of the Jesuits in Paraguay against the outragedone to their theories by the scheme the Jesuits pursued.It has been nobly said* `that the extinction of the smallest animalis a far greater loss than if the works of all the Greeks had perished.'How much the greater loss that of a type of man such as the Indians,whom the semi-communistic Jesuit government successfully preserved,sheltering them from the death-dealing breath of our cold northern lifeand its full, fell effects!--* Hudson, `Naturalist in La Plata'.--There are those, no doubt, who think that a tree brought from the tropicsshould be planted out at home, to take its chance of lifein the keen winter of the north, in holy competition with the ash and oak;and if it dies, there are still pines enough, with stores of dogwood,thickets of elder, and a wilderness of junipers.  They may be right;but, after all, that which has felt the tropic sun is for the tropics,and to grow under the tantalizing sunshine of the north, which lightsbut does not warm, it must have glass, and shelter from the cold.But of aforethought to deliberately transplant our fogsand chilling atmosphere, and so to nip and kill plantswhich crave only the sun to live, that is a crime against humanity;a crime posterity with execration will one day taunt us with,and hold us up to execration, as we to-day in our hypocrisypiously curse the memories of Pizarro and Cortes.In the eternal warfare between those who think that progress-- which to them means tramways and electric light -- is preferable toa quiet life of futile happiness of mind there is scant truce, so thatmy readers have to take their choice whether to side with Funes or Azarain judging of the Jesuits' rule in Paraguay.  There is no middle coursebetween the old and new; no halting-place; no chink in which imaginationcan drive in its nail to stop the wheels of time; therefore, no doubt,the Jesuit commonwealth was doomed to disappear.  But for myself,I am glad that five-and-twenty years ago I saw the Indians who still lingeredabout the ruined mission towns, mumbling their maimed riteswhen the Angelus at eventide awoke the echoes of the encroaching woods,whilst screeching crowds of parrots and macaws hovered aroundthe date-palms which in the plaza reared their slender heads,silent memorials of the departed Jesuits' rule.Indians and Jesuits are gone from Paraguay, the Indians to that Trapalandawhich is their appointed place; and for the Jesuits, they are forgotten,except by those who dive into old chronicles, or who write books,proposing something and concluding nothing, or by travellers,who, wandering in the Tarumensian woods, come on a clump of orange-treesrun wild amongst the urundeys.

D.W.]THE MAY-FLOWER AND HER LOGJuly 15, 1620--May 6, 1621Chiefly from Original SourcesBy AZEL AMES, M.D.Member of Pilgrim Society, etc.BOOK 3.CHAPTER VTHE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE MAYFLOWERThe officers and crew of the MAY-FLOWER were obviously important factorsin the success of the Pilgrim undertaking, and it is of interest to knowwhat we may concerning them. We have seen that the "pilot," John Clarke,was employed by Weston and Cushman, even before the vessel upon which hewas to serve had been found, and he had hence the distinction of beingthe first man "shipped" of the MAY-FLOWER'S complement.  It is evidentthat he was promptly hired on its being known that he had recentlyreturned from a voyage to Virginia in the cattle-ship FALCON, as certainto be of value in the colonists' undertakings.Knowing that the Adventurers' agents were seeking both a ship and amaster for her, it was the natural thing for the latter, that he shouldpropose the Captain under whom he had last sailed, on much the samevoyage as that now contemplated.  It is an interesting fact thatsomething of the uncertainty which for a time existed as to the names andfeatures of the Pilgrim barks attaches the names and identity of theirrespective commanders.  The "given" name of "Master" Reynolds, "pilott"and "Master" of the SPEED WELL, does not appear, but the assertion ofProfessor Arber, though positive enough, that "the Christian name of theCaptain of the MAY-FLOWER is not known," is not accepted by otherauthorities in Pilgrim history, though it is true that it does not findmention in the contemporaneous accounts of the Pilgrim ship and hervoyage.There is no room for doubt that the Captain of the FALCON--whose releasefrom arrest while under charge of piracy the Earl of Warwick procured,that he might take command of the above-named cattle-ship on her voyageto Virginia, as hereinafter shown--was Thomas Jones.  The identity ofthis man and "Master Jones" who assumed command of the MAY-FLOWER--withthe former mate of the FALCON, John Clarke, as his first officer--isabundantly certified by circumstantial evidence of the strongest kind, asis also the fact that he commanded the ship DISCOVERY a little later.With the powerful backing of such interested friends as the Earl ofWarwick and Sir Ferdinando Gorges, undoubtedly already in league withThomas Weston, who probably made the contract with Jones,as he had with Clarke, the suggestion of the latter as to the competencyand availability of his late commander would be sure of prompt approval,and thus, in all probability, Captain Thomas Jones, who finds his chiefplace in history--and a most important one--as Master of the MAY-FLOWER,came to that service.In 1619, as appears by Neill, the Virginia Company had one John Clarke inIreland, "buying cattle for Virginia." We know that Captain Jones soonsailed for Virginia with cattle, in the FALCON, of 150 tons, and as thiswas the only cattle ship in a long period, we can very certainly identifyClarke as the newly-hired mate of the MAY-FLOWER, who, Cush man says(letter of June 11/21, 1620), "went last year to Virginia with a ship ofkine."  As 1620 did not begin until March 25, a ship sailing in Februarywould have gone out in 1619, and Jones and Clarke could easily have madethe voyage in time to engage for the MAY-FLOWER in the following June."Six months after Jones's trip in the latter" (i.e.  after his returnfrom the Pilgrim voyage), Neill says, "he took the DISCOVERY (60 tons) toVirginia, and then northward, trading along the coast.  The Council forNew England complained of him to the Virginia Company for robbing thenatives on this voyage.  He stopped at Plymouth (1622), and, takingadvantage of the distress for food he found there, was extortionate inhis prices.  In July, 1625, he appeared at Jamestown, Virginia, inpossession of a Spanish frigate, which he said had been captured by onePowell, under a Dutch commission, but it was thought a resumption of hisold buccaneering practices.  Before investigation he sickened and died."That Jones was a man of large experience, and fully competent in hisprofession, is beyond dispute.  His disposition, character, and deedshave been the subject of much discussion.  By most writers he is held tohave been a man of coarse, "unsympathetic" nature, "a rough sea-dog,"capable of good feeling and kindly impulses at times, but neithergoverned by them nor by principle.  That he was a "highwayman of theseas," a buccaneer and pirate, guilty of blood for gold, there can be nodoubt.  Certainly nothing could justify the estimate of him given byProfessor Arber, that "he was both fair-minded and friendly toward thePilgrim Fathers," and he certainly stands alone among writers ofreputation in that opinion.  Jones's selfishness,     [Bradford himself--whose authority in the matter will not be     doubted--says (Historie, Mass. ed.  p. 112): "As this calamitie,     the general sickness, fell among ye passengers that were to be left     here to plant, and were basted ashore and made to drinke water, that     the sea-men might have ye more bear [beer] and one in his sickness     desiring but a small can of beare it was answered that if he were     their own father he should have none."  Bradford also shows (op.     cit.  p. 153) the rapacity of Jones, when in command of the     DISCOVERY, in his extortionate demands upon the Plymouth planters,     notwithstanding their necessities.]threats, boorishness, and extortion, to say nothing of his exceedinglybad record as a pirate, both in East and West Indian waters, compel a fardifferent estimate of him as a man, from that of Arber, however excellenthe was as a mariner. Professor Arber dissents from Goodwin's conclusionthat Captain Jones of the DISCOVERY was the former Master of the MAY-FLOWER, but the reasons of his dissent are by no means convincing.  Heargues that Jones would not have accepted the command of a vessel so muchsmaller than his last, the DISCOVERY being only one third the size of theMAY-FLOWER.  Master-mariners, particularly when just returned from longand unsuccessful voyages, especially if in bad repute,--as was Jones,--are obliged to take such employment as offers, and are often glad to geta ship much smaller than their last, rather than remain idle.  Moreover,in Jones's case, if, as appears, he was inclined to buccaneering, thesmaller ship would serve his purpose--as it seems it did satisfactorily.Nor is the fact that Bradford speaks of him--although previously so wellacquainted--as "one Captain Jones," to be taken as evidence, as Arberthinks, that the Master of the DISCOVERY was some other of the name.Bradford was writing history, and his thought just then was the especialProvidence of God in the timely relief afforded their necessities by thearrival of the ships with food, without regard to the individuals whobrought it, or the fact that one was an acquaintance of former years.On the other hand, Winslow--in his "Good Newes from New England"--records the arrival of the two ships in August, 1622, and says, "the oneas I take [recollect] it, was called the DISCOVERY, Captain Jones havingcommand thereof," which on the same line of argument as Arber's might beread, "our old acquaintance Captain Jones, you know"!  If the expressionof Bradford makes against its being Captain Jones, formerly of the MAY-FLOWER, Winslow's certainly makes quite as much for it, while the factwhich Winslow recites, viz. that the DISCOVERY, under Jones, was sailingas consort to the SPARROW, a ship of Thomas Weston,--who employed him forthe MAY-FLOWER, was linked with him in the Gorges conspiracy, and hadbecome nearly as degenerate as he,--is certainly significant.  There arestill better grounds, as will appear in the closely connected relationsof Jones, for holding with Goodwin rather than with Arber in the matter.The standard authority in the case is the late Rev. E. D. Neill, D. D.,for some years United States consul at Dublin, who made very considerableresearch into all matters pertaining to the Virginia Companies,consulting their original records and "transactions," the Dutch relateddocuments, the "Calendars of the East India Company," etc.  Upon him andhis exhaustive work all others have largely drawn,--notably ProfessorArber himself,--and his conclusions seem entitled to the same weight herewhich Arber gives them in other relations.  Dr. Neill is clearly ofopinion that the Captains of the MAY-FLOWER and the DISCOVERY wereidentical, and this belief is shared by such authorities in Pilgrimliterature as Young, Prince, Goodwin, and Davis, and against thisformidable consensus of opinion, Arber, unless better supported, canhardly hope to prevail.The question of Jones's duplicity and fraud, in bringing the Pilgrims toland at Cape Cod instead of the "neighbor-hood of Hudson's River," hasbeen much mooted and with much diversity of opinion, but in the light ofthe subjoined evidence and considerations it seems well-nigh impossibleto acquit him of the crime--for such it was, in inception, nature, andresults, however overruled for good.The specific statements of Bradford and others leave no room for doubtthat the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims fully intended to make their settlementsomewhere in the region of the mouth of "Hudson's River."  Morton statesin terms that Captain Jones's "engagement was to Hudson's River."Presumably, as heretofore noted, the stipulation of his charter partyrequired that he should complete his outward voyage in that generallocality.  The northern limits of the patents granted in the Pilgriminterest, whether that of John Wincob (or Wincop) sealed June 9/ 19,1619, but never used, or the first one to John Pierce, of February 2/12,1620, were, of course, brought within the limits of the First (London)Virginia Company's charter, which embraced, as is well-known, theterritory between the parallels of 34 deg. and 41 deg. N. latitude.The most northerly of these parallels runs but about twenty miles to thenorth of the mouth of "Hudson's River."  It is certain that the Pilgrims,after the great expense, labor, and pains of three years, to secure theprotection of these Patents, would not willingly or deliberately, haveplanted themselves outside that protection, upon territory where they hadnone, and where, as interlopers, they might reasonably expect troublewith the lawful proprietors.  Nor was there any reason why, if they sodesired, they should not have gone to "Hudson's River" or its vicinity,unless it was that they had once seemed to recognize the States Generalof Holland as the rightful owners of that territory, by making petitionto them, through the New Netherland Company, for their authority andprotection in settling there.  But even this fact constituted no moral orlegal bar to such action, if desirable First, because it appears certainthat, whatever the cause, they "broke off" themselves their negotiationswith the Dutch,--whether on account of the inducements offered by ThomasWeston, or a doubt of the ability of the Dutch to maintain their claim tothat region, and to protect there, or both, neither appears nor matters.Second, because the States General--whether with knowledge that they ofLeyden had so "broken off" or from their own doubts of their ability tomaintain their claim on the Hudson region, does not appear--rejected thepetition made to them in the Pilgrims' behalf.  It is probable that thelatter was the real reason, from the fact that the petition was twicerejected.In view of the high opinion of the Leyden brethren, entertained, as weknow, by the Dutch, it is clear that the latter would have been pleasedto secure them as colonists; while if at all confident of their rights tothe territory, they must have been anxious to colonize it and thusconfirm their hold, increase their revenues as speedily as possible,andThird, because it appears upon the showing of the petition itself, madeby the New Netherland Company (to which the Leyden leaders had looked,doubtless on account of its pretensions, for the authority and protectionof the States General, as they afterward did to the English VirginiaCompany for British protection), that this Company had lost its owncharter by expiration, and hence had absolutely nothing to offer theLeyden people beyond the personal and associate influence of its members,and the prestige of a name that had once been potential.  In fact, theNew Netherland Company was using the Leyden congregation as a leverage topry for itself from the States General new advantages, larger than it hadpreviously enjoyed.Moreover it appears by the evidence of both the petition of the Directorsof the New Netherland Company to the Prince of Orange (February 2/12,1619/20), and the letters of Sir Dudley Carleton, the British ambassadorat the Hague, to the English Privy Council, dated February 5/15, 1621/22,that, up to this latter date the Dutch had established no colony     [British State Papers, Holland, Bundle 165.  Sir Dudley Carleton's     Letters. "They have certain Factors there, continually resident,     trading with savages .  .  .  but I cannot learn of any colony,     either I already planted there by these people, or so much as     intended." Sir Dudley Carleton's Letters.]on the territory claimed by them at the Hudson, and had no otherrepresentation there than the trading-post of a commercial company whosecharter had expired.  There can be no doubt that the Leyden leaders knew,from their dealings with the New Netherland Company, and the study of thewhole problem which they evidently made, that this region was open tothem or any other parties for habitation and trade, so far as any priorgrants or charters under the Dutch were concerned, but they required morethan this.To Englishmen, the English claim to the territory at "Hudson's River"was valid, by virtue of the discovery of the Cabots, under the law ofnations as then recognized, not withstanding Hudson's more particularexplorations of those parts in 1609, in the service of Holland,especially as no colony or permanent occupancy of the region by theDutch had been made.Professor John Fiske shows that "it was not until the Protestant Englandof Elizabeth had come to a life-and-death grapple with Spain, and notuntil the discovery of America had advanced much nearer completion, sothat its value began to be more correctly understood, that political andcommercial motives combined in determining England to attack Spainthrough America, and to deprive her of supremacy in the colonial andmaritime world.  Then the voyages of the Cabots assumed an importanceentirely new, and could be quoted as the basis of a prior claim on thepart of the English Crown, to lands which it [through the Cabots] haddiscovered."Having in mind the terrible history of slaughter and reprisal between theSpanish and French (Huguenot) settlers in Florida in 1565-67,     [Bancroft, History of the United States, vol. i.  p. 68; Fiske,     Discovery of America, vol. ii.  p. 511 et seq.  With the terrible     experience of the Florida plantations in memory, the far-sighted     leaders of the Leyden church proposed to plant under the shelter of     an arm strong enough to protect them, and we find the Directors of     the New Netherland Company stating that the Leyden party (the     Pilgrims) can be induced to settle under Dutch auspices, "provided,     they would be guarded and preserved from all violence on the part of     other potentates, by the authority, and under the protection of your     Princely Excellency and the High and Mighty States General."     Petition of the Directors of the New Netherland Company to the     Prince of Orange.]the Pilgrims recognized the need of a strong power behind them, underwhose aegis they might safely plant, and by virtue of whose might andright they could hope to keep their lives and possessions.  The King ofEngland had, in 1606, granted charters to the two Virginia Companies,covering all the territory in dispute, and, there could be no doubt,would protect these grants and British proprietorship therein, againstall comers.  Indeed, the King (James I.) by letter to Sir DudleyCarleton, his ambassador at the Hague, under date of December 15, 1621,expressly claimed his rights in the New Netherland territory andinstructed him to impress upon the government of the States General hisMajesty's claim,--"who, 'jure prime occupation' hath good and sufficienttitle to these parts."  There can be no question that the overtures ofSandys, Weston, and others to make interest for them with one of theseEnglish Companies, agreed as well with both the preferences andconvictions of the Leyden Pilgrims, as they did with the hopes anddesigns of Sir Ferdinando Gorges.  In the light of these facts, thereappears to have been neither legal nor moral bar to the evident intentionof the Pilgrims to settle in the vicinity of "Hudson's River," if they soelected.  In their light, also, despite the positive allegations of thetruthful but not always reliable Morton, his charges of intrigue betweenthe Dutch and Master Jones of the MAY-FLOWER, to prevent the settlementof his ship's company at "Hudson's River," may well be doubted.  Writingin "New England's Memorial" in 1669, Morton says: "But some of the Dutch,having notice of their intentions, and having thoughts about the sametime of erecting a plantation there likewise, they fraudulently hired thesaid Jones, by delays while they were in England, and now under pretenceof the shoals the dangers of the Monomoy Shoals off Cape Cod todisappoint them in going thither."  He adds: "Of this plot between theDutch and Mr. Jones, I have had late and certain intelligence."  If thisintelligence was more reliable than his assertion concerning theresponsibility of Jones for the "delays while they were in England," itmay well be discredited, as not the faintest evidence appears to make himresponsible for those delays, and they are amply accounted for withouthim.  Without questioning the veracity of Morton (while suggesting hismany known errors, and that the lapse of time made it easy tomisinterpret even apparently certain facts), it must be remembered thathe is the original sponsor for the charge of Dutch intrigue with Jones,and was its sole support for many years.  All other writers who haveaccepted and indorsed his views are of later date, and but follow him,while Bradford and Winslow, who were victims of this Dutch conspiracyagainst them, if it ever existed, were entirely silent in their writingsupon the matter, which we may be sure they would not have been, had theysuspected the Dutch as prime movers in the treachery.  That there was aconspiracy to accomplish the landing of the MAY-FLOWER planters at apoint north of "the Hudson" (in fact, north of the bounds defined by the(first) Pierce patent, upon which they relied), i.e. north of 41 deg. N.latitude,--is very certain; but that it was of Dutch origin, or basedupon motives which are attributed to the Dutch, is clearly erroneous.While the historical facts indicate an utter lack of motive for such anintrigue on the part of the Dutch, either as a government or asindividuals, there was no lack of motive on the part of certain others,who, we can but believe, were responsible for the conspiracy.  Moreover,the chief conspirators were such, that, even if the plot was ultimatelysuspected by the Pilgrims, a wise policy--indeed, self-preservation--would have dictated their silence.  That the Dutch were withoutsufficient motive or interest has been declared.  That the States Generalcould have had no wish to reject so exceptionally excellent a body ofcolonists as subjects, and as tenants to hold and develop their disputedterritory--if in position to receive them and guarantee them protection--is clear.  The sole objection that could be urged against them was theirEnglish birth, and with English regiments garrisoning the Dutch homecities, and foreigners of every nation in the States General's employ, byland and by sea, such an objection could have had no weight. Indeed, theLeyden party proposed, if they effected satisfactory arrangements withthe States General (as stated by the Directors of the New NetherlandCompany), "to plant there [at "Hudson's River"] a new commonwealth, allunder the order and command of your Princely Excellency and their HighMightinesses the States General: The Leyden Pilgrims were men who kepttheir agreements.The Dutch trading-companies, who were the only parties in the LowCountries who could possibly have had any motive for such a conspiracy,were at this time themselves without charters, and the overtures of theprincipal company, made to the government in behalf of themselves and theLeyden brethren, had recently, as we have seen, been twice rejected.They had apparently, therefore, little to hope for in the near future;certainly not enough to warrant expenditure and the risk of disgracefulexposure, in negotiations with a stranger--an obscure ship-master--tochange his course and land his passengers in violation of the terms ofhis charter-party;--negotiations, moreover, in which neither of theparties could well have had any guaranty of the other's good faith.But, as previously asserted, there was a party--to whom such knavery wasan ordinary affair--who had ample motive, and of whom Master Thomas Joneswas already the very willing and subservient ally and tool, and had beensuch for years.  Singularly enough, the motive governing this party wasexactly the reverse of that attributed--though illogically and withoutreason--to the Dutch.  In the case of the latter, the alleged animus wasa desire to keep the Pilgrim planters away from their "Hudson's River"domain. In the case of the real conspirators, the purpose was to securethese planters as colonists for, and bring them to, the more northernterritory owned by them.  It is well known that Sir Ferdinando Gorges wasthe leading spirit of the "Second Virginia Company," as he also became(with the Earl of Warwick a close second) of "The Council for the Affairsof New England," of which both men were made "Governors," in November of1620, when the Council practically superseded the "Second VirginiaCompany."  The Great Charter for "The Council of Affairs of New England,"commonly known as "The Council for New England," issued Tuesday, November3/13, 1620, and it held in force till Sunday, June 7/17, 1635.Although not its official head, and ranked at its board by dukes andearls, Sir Ferdinando Gorges was--as he had been in the old Plymouth (orSecond) Virginia Company--the leading man.  This was largely from hissuperior acquaintance with, and long and varied experience in, NewEngland affairs.  The "Council" was composed of forty patentees, andBaxter truly states, that "Sir Ferdinando Gorges, at this time [1621]stood at the head of the Council for New England, so far as influencewent; in fact, his hand shaped its affairs."  This company, holding--bythe division of territory made under the original charter-grants--a stripof territory one hundred miles wide, on the North American coast, betweenthe parallels of 41 deg. and 45 deg. N. latitude, had not prospered, andits efforts at colonization (on what is now the Maine coast), in 1607 andlater, had proved abortive, largely through the character of its"settlers," who had been, in good degree, a somewhat notable mixture oftwo of the worst elements of society,--convicts and broken-down"gentlemen.""In 1607," says Goodwin,  "Gorges and the cruel Judge Popham planted acolony at Phillipsburg (or Sagadahoc, as is supposed), by the mouth ofthe Kennebec.  Two ships came, 'THE GIFT OF GOD' and the 'MARY AND JOHN,'bringing a hundred persons.  Through August they found all delightful,but when the ships went back in December, fifty five of the numberreturned to England, weary of their experience and fearful of the cold....  With spring the ships returned from England; "but by this time theremainder were ready to leave," so every soul returned with Gilbert [theAdmiral] .  .  .  .  For thirty years Gorges continued to pushexploration and emigration to that region, but his ambition andliberality ever resulted in disappointment and loss."  The annals of thetime show that not a few of the Sagadahoc colonists were convicts,released from the English jails to people this colony.Hakluyt says: "In 1607 [this should read 1608], disheartened by the deathof Popham, they all embarked in a ship from Exeter and in the newpynnace, the 'VIRGINIA,' built in the colony, and sett sail for England,and this was the end of that northern colony upon the river Sachadehoc[Kennebec]."No one knew better than the shrewd Gorges the value of such a colony asthat of the Leyden brethren would be, to plant, populate, and develop hisCompany's great demesne.  None were more facile than himself and thebuccaneering Earl of Warwick, to plan and execute the bold, but--as itproved--easy coup, by which the Pilgrim colony was to be stolen bodily;for the benefit of the "Second Virginia Company" and its successor,"the Council for New England," from the "First (or London) Company,"under whose patent (to John Pierce) and patronage they sailed.  Theyapparently did not take their patent with them,--it would have beenworthless if they had,--and they were destined to have no small troublewith Pierce, before they were established in their rights under the newpatent granted him (in the interest of the Adventurers and themselves),by the "Council for New England."  Master John Wincob's early and silentwithdrawal from his apparently active connection with the Pilgrimmovement, and the evident cancellation of the first patent issued to himin its interest, by the (London) Virginia Company, have never beensatisfactorily explained.  Wincob (or Wincop), we are told, "was areligious Gentleman, then belonging to the household of the Countess ofLincoln, who intended to go with them [the Pilgrims] but God so disposedas he never went, nor they ever made use of this Patent, which had costthem so much labor and charge."  Wincob, it appears by the minutes of the(London) Virginia Company of Wednesday, May 26/June 5, 1619, wascommended to the Company, for the patent he sought, by the fourth Earl ofLincoln, and it was doubtless through his influence that it was grantedand sealed, June 9/19, 1619.  But while Wincob was a member of thehousehold of the Dowager Countess of Lincoln, mother of the fourth Earlof Lincoln; John, the eldest son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, had marriedthe Earl's daughter (sister ?), and hence Gorges stood in a much nearerrelation to the Earl than did his mother's friend and dependant (asWincob evidently was), as well as on a much more equal social footing.By the minutes of the (London) Virginia Company of Wednesday, February 2/12, 1619/20, it appears that a patent was "allowed and sealed to JohnPierce and his associates, heirs and assigns," for practically the sameterritory for which the patent to Wincob had been given but eight monthsbefore.  No explanation was offered, and none appears of record, but thelogical conclusion is, that the first patent had been cancelled, thatMaster Wincob's personal interest in the Pilgrim exodus had ceased, andthat the Lincoln patronage had been withdrawn.  It is a rationalconjecture that Sir Ferdinando Gorges, through the relationship hesustained to the Earl, procured the withdrawal of Wincob and his patent,knowing that the success of his (Gorges's) plot would render the Wincobpatent worthless, and that the theft of the colony, in his own interest,would be likely to breed "unpleasantness" between himself and Wincob'ssponsors and friends among the Adventurers, many of whom were friends ofthe Earl of Lincoln.The Earl of Warwick, the man of highest social and political rank in theFirst (or London) Virginia Company, was, at about the same time, inducedby Gorges to abandon his (the London) Company and unite with himself insecuring from the Crown the charter of the "Council of Affairs for NewEngland."  The only inducements he could offer for the change mustapparently have resided in the promised large results of plottingsdisclosed by him (Gorges), but he needed the influential and unscrupulousEarl for the promotion of his schemes, and won him, by some means, to anactive partnership, which was doubtless congenial to both. The "fineItalian hand" of Sir Ferdinando hence appears at every stage, and inevery phase, of the Leyden movement, from the mission of Weston toHolland, to the landing at Cape Cod, and every movement clearly indicatesthe crafty cunning, the skilful and brilliant manipulation, and thedogged determination of the man.That Weston was a most pliant and efficient tool in the hands of Gorges,"from start to finish" of this undertaking, is certainly apparent.Whether he was, from the outset, made fully aware of the sinister designsof the chief conspirator, and a party to them, admits of some doubt,though the conviction strengthens with study, that he was, from thebeginning, 'particeps criminis'.  If he was ever single-minded for thewelfare of the Leyden brethren and the Adventurers, it must have been fora very brief time at the inception of the enterprise; and circumstancesseem to forbid crediting him with honesty of purpose, even then.  Theweight of evidence indicates that he both knew, and was fully enlistedin, the entire plot of Gorges from the outset.  In all its early stageshe was its most efficient promoter, and seems to have given ample proofof his compliant zeal in its execution. His visit to the Leyden brethrenin Holland was, apparently, wholly instigated by Gorges, as the lattercomplacently claims and collateral evidence proves.  In his endeavor toinduce the leaders to "break off with the Dutch," their pendingnegotiations for settlement at "Hudson's River," he evidently madecapital of, and traded upon, his former kindness to some of them whenthey were in straits,--a most contemptible thing in itself, yetcharacteristic of the man.  He led the Pilgrims to "break off" theirdealings with the Dutch by the largest and most positive promises ofgreater advantages through him, few of which he ever voluntarily kept (aswe see by John Robinson's sharp arraignment of him), his whole objectbeing apparently to get the Leyden party into his control and that of hisfriends,--the most subtle and able of whom was Gorges.  Bradford recitesthat Weston not only urged the Leyden leaders "not to meddle with yeDutch," but also,--"not too much to depend on ye Virginia [London]Company," but to rely on himself and his friends.  This strongly suggestsactive cooperation with Gorges, on Weston's part, at the outset, with theintent (if he could win them by any means, from allegiance to the First(London) Virginia Company), to lead the Leyden party, if possible, intoGorges's hands and under the control and patronage of the Second (orPlymouth) Virginia Company.  Whatever the date may have been, at which(as Bradford states) the Leyden people "heard, both by Mr. Weston andothers, yt sundrie Honble: Lords had obtained a large grante from ye kingfor ye more northerly parts of that countrie, derived out of ye Virginiapatents, and wholly secluded from theire Governmente, and to be called byanother name, viz. New England, unto which Mr. Weston and the chiefe ofthem begane to incline;" Bradford leaves us in no doubt as to Weston'sattitude toward the matter itself.  It is certain that the governor,writing from memory, long afterward, fixed the time at which the Honble:Lords had obtained "their large grante" much earlier than it couldpossibly have occurred, as we know the exact date of the patent for the,"Council for New England," and that the order for its issue was not giventill just as the Pilgrims left Leyden; so that they could not have knownof the actual "grante" till they reached Southampton.  The essentialfact, stated on this best of authority, is, that "Mr. Weston and thechiefe of them [their sponsors, i.e. Weston and Lord Warwick, both inleague with Gorges "begane to incline" to Gorges's new "Council for NewEngland."  Such an attitude (evidently taken insidiously) meant, onWeston's part, of necessity, no less than treachery to his associates ofthe Adventurers; to the (London) Virginia Company, and to the Leydencompany and their allied English colonists, in the interest of SirFerdinando Gorges and his schemes and of the new "Council" that Gorgeswas organizing.  Weston's refusal to advance "a penny" to clear thedeparting Pilgrims from their port charges at Southampton; his almostimmediate severance of connection with both the colonists and theAdventurers; and his early association with Gorges,--in open anddisgraceful violation of all the formers' rights in New England,--to saynothing of his exhibition of a malevolence rarely exercised except towardthose one has deeply wronged, all point to a complete and positivesurrender of himself and his energies to the plot of Gorges, as a fullparticipant, from its inception. In his review of the Anniversary Addressof Hon. Charles Francis Adams (of July 4, 1892, at Quincy), Daniel W.Baker, Esq., of Boston, says: "The Pilgrim Fathers were influenced intheir decision to come to New England by Weston, who, if not the agent ofGorges in this particular matter, was such in other matters and heldintimate relations with him."The known facts favor the belief that Gorges's cogitations on colonialmatters--especially as stimulated by his plottings in relation to theLeyden people--led to his project of the grant--and charter for the new"Council for New England," designed and constituted to supplant, oroverride, all others.  It is highly probable that this grand scheme--duly embellished by the crafty Gorges,--being unfolded to Weston, withsuggestions of great opportunities for Weston himself therein, warmed anddrew him, and brought him to full and zealous cooperation in all Gorges'splans, and that from this time, as Bradford states, he "begane toincline" toward, and to suggest to the Pilgrims, association with Gorgesand the new "Council."  Not daring openly to declare his change ofallegiance and his perfidy, he undertook, apparently, at first, bysuggestions, e.g.  "not to place too much dependence on the LondonCompany, but to rely on himself and friends;" that "the fishing of NewEngland was good," etc.; and making thus no headway, then, by a policy ofdelay, fault finding, etc., to breed dissatisfaction, on the Pilgrims'part, with the Adventurers, the patent of Wincob, etc., with the hope ofbringing about "a new deal" in the Gorges interest. The same "delays" insailing, that have been adduced as proof of Jones's complicity with theDutch, would have been of equal advantage to these noble schemers, and ifhe had any hand in them-which does not appear--it would have been farmore likely in the interest of his long-time patron, the Earl of Warwick,and of his friends, than of any Dutch conspirators.Once the colonists were landed upon the American soil, especially if latein the season, they would not be likely, it doubtless was argued, toremove; while by a liberal policy on the part of the "Council for NewEngland" toward them--when they discovered that they were upon itsterritory--they could probably be retained.  That just such a policy was,at once and eagerly, adopted toward them, as soon as occasion permitted,is good proof that the scheme was thoroughly matured from the start.  Therecord of the action of the "Council for New England"--which had becomethe successor of the Second Virginia Company before intelligence wasreceived that the Pilgrims had landed on its domain--is not at hand,but it appears by the record of the London Company, under date of Monday,July 16/26, 1621, that the "Council for New England" had promptly madeitself agreeable to the colonists.  The record reads: "It was moved,seeing that Master John Pierce had taken a Patent of Sir FerdinandoGorges, and thereupon seated his Company [the Pilgrims] within the limitsof the Northern Plantations, as by some was supposed,"' etc.  From thisit is plain that, on receipt by Pierce of the news that the colony waslanded within the limits of the "Council for New England," he had, asinstructed, applied for, and been given (June 1, 1621), the (first)"Council" patent for the colony.  For confirmation hereof one should seealso the minutes of the "Council for New England" of March 25/April 4.,1623, and the fulsome letter of Robert Cushman returning thanks in behalfof the Planters (through John Pierce), to Gorges, for his prompt responseto their request for a patent and for his general complacency toward themHon. James Phinney Baxter, Gorges's able and faithful biographer, says:"We can imagine with what alacrity he [Sir Ferdinando] hastened to giveto Pierce a patent in their behalf."  The same biographer, clearlyunconscious of the well-laid plot of Gorges and Warwick (as all otherwriters but Neill and Davis have been), bears testimony (all the strongerbecause the witness is unwitting of the intrigue), to the ardent interestGorges had in its success.  He says: "The warm desire of Sir FerdinandoGorges to see a permanent colony founded within the domain of thePlymouth [or Second] Virginia Company was to be realized in a manner ofwhich he had never dreamed [sic!] and by a people with whom he had butlittle sympathized, although we know that he favored their settlementwithin the territorial limits of the Plymouth [Second] Company." He hadindeed "favored their settlement," by all the craft of which he wasmaster, and greeted their expected and duly arranged advent with all thejubilant open-handedness with which the hunter treats the wild horse hehas entrapped, and hopes to domesticate and turn to account. Everythingfavored the conspirators.  The deflection north-ward from the normalcourse of the ship as she approached the coast, bound for the latitude ofthe Hudson, required only to be so trifling that the best sailor of thePilgrim leaders would not be likely to note or criticise it, and it wasby no means uncommon to make Cape Cod as the first landfall on Virginiavoyages.  The lateness of the arrival on the coast, and the difficultiesever attendant on doubling Cape Cod, properly turned to account, wouldincrease the anxiety for almost any landing-place, and render it easy toretain the sea-worn colonists when once on shore.  The grand advantage,however, over and above all else, was the entire ease and certainty withwhich the cooperation of the one man essential to the success of theundertaking could be secured, without need of the privity of any other,viz. the Master of the MAY-FLOWER, Captain Thomas Jones.Let us see upon what the assumption of this ready and certain accord onthe part of Captain Jones rests.  Rev. Dr. Neill, whose thorough study ofthe records of the Virginia Companies, and of the East India CompanyCalendars and collateral data, entitles him to speak with authority,recites that, "In 1617, Capt. Thomas Jones (sometimes spelled Joanes) hadbeen sent to the East Indies in command of the ship LION by the Earl ofWarwick (then Sir Robt. Rich), under a letter of protection from the Dukeof Savoy, a foreign prince, ostensibly 'to take pirates,' which [pretext]had grown, as Sir Thomas Roe (the English ambassador with the GreatMogul) states, 'to be a common pretence for becoming pirate.'"  Caught bythe famous Captain Martin Pring, in full pursuit of the junk of the QueenMother of the Great Mogul, Jones was attacked, his ship fired in thefight, and burned,--with some of his crew,--and he was sent a prisoner toEngland in the ship BULL, arriving in the Thames, January 1, 1618/19.  Noaction seems to have been taken against him for his offences, andpresumably his employer, Sir Robert, the coming Earl, obtained hisliberty on one pretext or another.  On January 19, however, complaint wasmade against Captain Jones, "late of the LION," by the East IndiaCompany, "for hiring divers men to serve the King of Denmark in the EastIndies."  A few days after his arrest for "hiring away the Company's men,Lord Warwick got him off" on the claim that he had employed him"to go to Virginia with cattle."  From the "Transactions" of the SecondVirginia Company, of which--as we have seen--Sir Ferdinando Gorges wasthe leading spirit, it appears that on "February 2, 1619/20, a commissionwas allowed Captain Thomas Jones of the FALCON, a ship of 150 tons" [hehaving been lately released from arrest by the Earl of Warwick'sintercession], and that "before the close of the month, he sailed withcattle for Virginia," as previously noted.  Dr. Neill, than whom therecan be no better authority, was himself satisfied, and unequivocallystates, that "Thomas Jones, Captain of the MAY-FLOWER, was without doubtthe old servant of Lord Warwick in the East Indies."  Having done SirRobert Rich's (the Earl of Warwick's) "dirty work" for years, and havingon all occasions been saved from harm by his noble patron (even whenpiracy and similar practices had involved him in the meshes of the law),it would be but a trifling matter, at the request of such powerfulfriends as the Earl and Sir Ferdinando Gorges, to steal the PilgrimColony from the London Virginia Company, and hand it over bodily to the"Council for New England,"--the successor of the Second (Plymouth)Virginia Company,--in which their interests were vested, Warwick having,significantly, transferred his membership from the London Company to thenew "Council for New England," as it was commonly called.  Neill states,and there is abundant proof, that "the Earl of Warwick and Gorges were insympathy," and were active coadjutors, while it is self-evident that bothwould be anxious to accomplish the permanent settlement of the "NorthernPlantations" held by their Company.  That they would hesitate to utilizeso excellent an opportunity to secure so very desirable a colony, by anymeans available, our knowledge of the men and their records makes itimpossible to believe,--while nothing could apparently have been easierof accomplishment.  It will readily be understood that if theconspirators were these men,--upon whose grace the Pilgrims must dependfor permission to remain upon the territory to which they had beeninveigled, or even for permission to depart from it, without spoliation,--men whose influence with the King (no friend to the Pilgrims) wassufficient to make both of them, in the very month of the Pilgrims'landing, "governors" of "The Council for New England," under whoseauthority the Planters must remain,--the latter were not likely to voicetheir suspicions of the trick played upon them, if they discovered it,or openly to resent it, when known. Dr. Dexter, in commenting on theremark of Bradford, "We made Master Jones our leader, for we thought itbest herein to gratifie his kindness & forwardness," sensibly says,"This proves nothing either way, in regard to the charge which SecretaryMorton makes of treachery against Jones, in landing the company so farnorth, because, if that were true, it was not known to any of the companyfor years afterward, and of course could not now [at that time] impairtheir feelings of confidence in, or kindness towards, him.  "Moreover,the phraseology, "we thought it best to gratifie," suggests ratherconsiderations of policy than cordial desire, and their acquaintance,too, with the man was still young. There is, however, no evidence thatJones's duplicity was suspected till long afterward,  though hischaracter was fully recognized.  Gorges himself furnishes, in hiswritings, the strongest confirmation we have of the already apparentfact, that he was himself the prime conspirator.  He says, in his own"Narration," "It was referred [evidently by himself] to their [the LondonVirginia Company's] consideration, how necessary it was that means mightbe used to draw unto those their enterprises, some of those families thathad retired themselves into Holland for scruple of conscience, givingthem such freedom and liberty as might stand with their liking."  Whenhave we ever found Sir Ferdinando Gorges thus solicitous for the successof the rival Virginia Company?  Why, if he so esteemed the Leyden peopleas excellent colonists, did he not endeavor to secure them himselfdirectly, for his own languishing company?  Certainly the "scruple ofconscience" of the Leyden brethren did not hinder him, for he found it nobar, though of the Established Church himself, to giving them instantlyall and more than was asked in their behalf, as soon as he had them uponhis territory and they had applied for a patent.  He well knew that itwould be matter of some expense and difficulty to bring the Leydencongregation into agreement to go to either of the Virginia grants, andhe doubtless, and with good reason, feared that his repute and thecharacter and reputation of his own Company, with its past history offailure, convict settlers, and loose living, would be repellent to thesepeople of "conscience."  If they could be brought to the "going-point,"by men more of their ilk, like Sir Edwin Sandys, Weston, and others, itwould then be time to see if he could not pluck the ripe fruit forhimself,--as he seems to have done."This advice," he says, "being hearkened unto, there were [those] thatundertook the putting it in practice [Weston and others] and it wasaccordingly brought to effect," etc. Then, reciting (erroneously) thedifficulties with the SPEEDWELL, etc., he records the MAY-FLOWER'Sarrival at Cape Cod, saying, "The .  .  .  ship with great difficultyreached the coast of New England."  He then gives a glowing, thoughabsurd, account of the attractions the planters found--in midwinter--especially naming the hospitable reception of the Indians, despite thefact of the savage attack made upon them by the Nausets at Cape Cod, andadds: "After they had well considered the state of their affaiis andfound that the authority they had from the London Company of Virginia,could not warrant their abode in that place," which "they found soprosperous and pleasing [sic] they hastened away their ship, with ordersto their Solicitor to deal with me to be a means they might have a grantfrom the Council of New England Affairs, to settle in the place, whichwas accordingly performed to their particular satisfaction and goodcontent of them all."  One can readily imagine the crafty smile withwhich Sir Ferdinando thus guilelessly recorded the complete success ofhis plot.  It is of interest to note how like a needle to the pole thegrand conspirator's mind flies to the fact which most appeals to him--that they find "that the authority they had .  .  .  could not warranttheir abode in that place."  It is of like interest to observe that inthat place which he called "pleasant and prosperous" one half their ownand of the ship's company had died before they hastened the ship away,and they had endured trial, hardships, and sorrows untellable,--althoughfrom pluck and principle they would not abandon it.  He tells us "theyhastened away their ship," and implies that it was for the chief purposeof obtaining through him a grant of the land they occupied.  While weknow that the ship did not return till the following April,--and then ather Captain's rather than the Pilgrims' pleasure,--it is evident thatGorges could think of events only as incident to his designs and from hispoint of view.  His plot had succeeded.  He had the "Holland families"upon his soil, and his willing imagination converted their sober anddeliberate action into the eager haste with which he had planned thatthey should fly to him for the patent, which his cunning had--as hepurposed--rendered necessary.  Of course their request "was performed,"and so readily and delightedly that, recognizing John Pierce as theirmouthpiece and the plantation as "Mr. Pierces Plantation," Sir Ferdinandoand his associates--the "Council for New England," including his joint-conspirator, the Earl of Warwick--gave Pierce unhesitatingly whatever heasked. The Hon. William T. Davis, who alone among Pilgrim historians(except Dr. Neill, whom he follows) seems to have suspected the hand ofGorges in the treachery of Captain Jones, here demonstrated, hassuggested that: "Whether Gorges might not have influenced Pierce, inwhose name the patent of the Pilgrims had been issued--and whether bothtogether might not have seduced Capt. Jones, are further considerationsto be weighed, in solving the problem of a deviation from the intendedvoyage of the MAYFLOWER."  Although not aware of these suggestions,either of Mr. Davis or of Dr. Neill, till his own labors had satisfiedhim of Gorges's guilt, and his conclusions were formed, the authorcheerfully recognizes the priority to his own demonstration, of thesuggestions of both these gentlemen.  No thing appears of record,however, to indicate that John Pierce was in any way a party to Gorges'splot.  On the contrary, as his interest was wholly allied to his patent,which Gorges's scheme would render of little value to his associateAdventurers and himself he would naturally have been, unless heavilybribed to duplicity beyond his expectations from their intended venture,the last man to whom to disclose such a conspiracy.  Neither was henecessary in any way to the success of the scheme.  He did not hireeither the ship or her master; he does not appear to have had any Pilgrimrelations to Captain Jones, and certainly could have had no suchinfluence with him as Gorges could himself command, through Warwick andhis own ability--from his position at the head of the "New EnglandCouncil"--to reward the service he required.  That Gorges was ablehimself to exert all the influence requisite to secure Jones'scooperation, without the aid of Pierce, who probably could have givennone, is evident.  Mr. Davis's suggestion, while pertinent and potentialas to Gorges, is clearly wide of the mark as to Pierce.  He representedthe Adventurers in the matter of patents only, but Weston was inauthority as to the pivotal matter of shipping.  An evidently hastyfootnote of Dr. Neill, appended to the "Memorial" offered by him to theCongress of the United States, in 1868, seems to have been the onlyauthority of Mr. William T. Davis for the foregoing suggestion as to thecomplicity of Pierce in the treachery of Captain Jones, except the baresuspicion, already alluded to, in the records of the London Company.Neill says: "Captain Jones, the navigator of the MAY-FLOWER, and JohnPierce, probably had arranged as to destination without the knowledge ofthe passengers."  While of course this is not impossible, there is, asstated, absolutely nothing to indicate any knowledge, participation, orneed of Pierce in the matter, and of course the fewer there were in thesecret the better.Unobservant that John Pierce was acting upon the old adage, "second thiefbest owner," when he asked, a little later, even so extraordinary a thingas that the "Council for New England" would exchange the patent they hadso promptly granted him (as representing his associates, the Adventurersand Planters) for a "deed-pole," or title in fee, to himself alone, theyinstantly complied, and thus unwittingly enabled him also to steal thecolony, and its demesne beside. It is evident, from the very servileletter of Robert Cushman to John Pierce (written while the former was atNew Plymouth, in November-December, 1621, on behalf of the MAY-FLOWERAdventurers), that up to that time at least, the Pilgrims had nosuspicion of the trick which had been played upon them.  For, while tooadroit recklessly to open a quarrel with those who could--if they chose--destroy them, the Pilgrims were far too high-minded to stoop to flatteryand dissimulation (especially with any one known to have been guilty oftreachery toward them), or to permit any one to do so in their stead.In the letter referred to, Cush man acknowledges in the name of thecolonists the "bounty and grace of the President and Council of theAffairs of New England [Gorges, Warwick, et als.] for their allowance andapprobation" of the "free possession and enjoyment" of the territory andrights so promptly granted Pierce by the Council, in the colonists'interest, upon application.  If the degree of promptness with which thewily Gorges and his associates granted the petition of Pierce, in thecolony's behalf for authority to occupy the domain to which Gorges'shenchman Jones had so treacherously conveyed them, was at allproportionate to the fulsome and lavish acknowledgments of Cushman,there must have been such eagerness of compliance as to provoke generalsuspicion at the Council table. Gorges and Warwick must have "grinnedhorribly behind their hands" upon receipt of the honest thanks of thesehonest planters and the pious benedictions of their scribe, knowingthemselves guilty of detestable conspiracy and fraud, which hadfrustrated an honest purpose, filched the results of others' labors, andhad "done to death" good men and women not a few.  Winslow, in"Hypocrisie Unmasked," says: "We met with many dangers and the mariners'put back into the harbor of the Cape."  The original intent of thePilgrims to go to the neighborhood of the Hudson is unmistakable; thatthis intention was still clear on the morning of November 10 (not 9th)--after they had "made the land"--has been plainly shown; that there was noneed of so "standing in with the land" as to become entangled in the"rips" and "shoals" off what is now known as Monomoy (in an effort topass around the Cape to the southward, when there was plenty of openwater to port), is clear and certain; that the dangers and difficultieswere magnified by Jones, and the abandonment of the effort was urged andpractically made by him, is also evident from Winslow's language abovenoted,--"and the mariners put back," etc.  No indication of the old-timeconsultations with the chief men appears here as to the matter of thereturn.  Their advice was not desired. "The mariners put back" on theirown responsibility.Goodwin forcibly remarks, "These waters had been navigated by Gosnold,Smith, and various English and French explorers, whose descriptions andcharts must have been familiar to a veteran master like Jones.  Hedoubtless magnified the danger of the passage [of the shoals], and managedto have only such efforts made as were sure to fail.  Of course he knewthat by standing well out, and then southward in the clear sea, he wouldbe able to bear up for the Hudson. His professed inability to devise anyway for getting south of the Cape is strong proof of guilt."The sequential acts of the Gorges conspiracy were doubtless practicallyas follows:--(a) The Leyden leaders applied to the States General of Holland, throughthe New Netherland Company, for their aid and protection in locating atthe mouth of "Hudson's" River;(b) Sir Dudley Carleton, the English ambassador at the Hague, doubtlesspromptly reported these negotiations to the King, through Sir RobertNaunton;(c) The King, naturally enough, probably mentioned the matter to hisintimate and favorite, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the leading man in Americancolonization matters in the kingdom;(d) Sir Ferdinando Gorges, recognizing the value of such colonists as theLeyden congregation would make, anxious to secure them, instead ofpermitting the Dutch to do so, and knowing that he and his Company wouldbe obnoxious to the Leyden leaders, suggested, as he admits, to Weston,perhaps to Sandys, as the Leyden brethren's friends, that they ought tosecure them as colonists for their (London) Company;(e) Weston was dispatched to Holland to urge the Leyden leaders to dropthe Dutch negotiations, come under English auspices, which he guaranteed,and they, placing faith in him, and possibly in Sandys's assurances ofhis (London) Virginia Company's favor, were led to put themselvescompletely into the hands of Weston and the Merchant Adventurers; theWincob patent was cancelled and Pierces substituted;(f) Weston, failing to lead them to Gorges's company, was next deputed,perhaps by Gorges's secret aid, to act with full powers for theAdventurers, in securing shipping, etc.;(g) Having made sure of the Leyden party, and being in charge of theshipping, Weston was practically master of the situation.  He andCushman, who was clearly entirely innocent of the conspiracy, had thehiring of the ship and of her officers, and at this point he and his actswere of vital importance to Gorges's plans.  To bring the plot to asuccessful issue it remained only to effect the landing of the colonyupon territory north of the 41 st parallel of north lati tude, to take itout of the London Company's jurisdiction, and to do this it was onlynecessary to make Jones Master of the ship and to instruct himaccordingly.  This, with so willing a servant of his masters, was amatter of minutes only, the instructions were evidently given, and thesuccess of the plot--the theft of the MAY-FLOWER colony--was assured.To a careful and candid student of all the facts, the proofs areseemingly unmistakable, and the conclusion is unavoid able, that the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims were designedly brought to Cape Cod by Captain Jones, andtheir landing in that latitude was effected, in pursuance of a conspiracyentered into by him, not with the Dutch, but with certain of the nobilityof England; not with the purpose of keeping the planters out of Dutchterritory, but with the deliberate intent of stealing the colony from theLondon Virginia Company, under whose auspices it had organized and setsail, in the interest, and to the advantage, of its rival Company of the"Northern Plantations."It is noteworthy that Jones did not command the MAY-FLOWER for anothervoyage, and never sailed afterward in the employ of Thomas Goffe, Esq.,or (so far as appears) of any reputable shipowner.  Weston was not such,nor were the chiefs of the "Council for New England," in whose employ heremained till his death.The records of the Court of the "Council" show, that "as soon as it woulddo," and when his absence would tend to lull suspicion as to the partsplayed, Captain Jones's noble patrons took steps to secure for him duerecognition and compensation for his services, from the parties who wereto benefit directly, with themselves, by his knavery.  The records read:"July 17, 1622.  A motion was made in the behaffe of Captaine ThomasJones, Captaine of the DISCOVERY, nowe employed in Virginia for trade andfishinge [it proved, apparently, rather to be piracy], that he may beadmitted a freeman in this Companie in reward of the good service he haththere [Virginia in general] performed.  The Court liked well of themotion and condiscended thereunto."  The DISCOVERY left London at theclose of November, 1621.  She arrived at Jamestown, Virginia, in April,1622. She reached Plymouth, New England, in August, 1622. Her outwardvoyage was not, so far as can be learned, eventful, or entitled toespecial consideration or recognition, and the good store of Englishtrading-goods she still had on hand--as Governor Bradford notices--onher arrival at Plymouth indicates no notable success up to that time, inthe way of a trading-voyage, while "fishing" is not mentioned.  Forpiracy, in which she was later more successful, she had then had neithertime nor opportunity.  The conclusion is irresistible, that "the goodservice" recognized by the vote recorded was of the past (he had sailedonly the MAY-FLOWER voyage for the "Council" before), and that thisrecognition was a part of the compensation previously agreed upon, if,in the matter of the MAY-FLOWER voyage, Captain Jones did as he wasbidden.  Thus much of the crafty Master of the MAY-FLOWER, Captain ThomasJones,--his Christian name and identity both apparently beyond dispute,--whom we first know in the full tide of his piratical career, in thecorsair LION in Eastern seas; whom we next find as a prisoner in Londonfor his misconduct in the East, but soon Master of the cattle-ship FALCONon her Virginia voyage; whom we greet next--and best--as Admiral of thePilgrim fleet, commander of the destiny freighted MAY-FLOWER, and thougha conspirator with nobles against the devoted band he steered, under theoverruling hand of their Lord God, their unwitting pilot to "imperiallabors" and mighty honors, to the founding of empire, and to eternalPeace; whom we next meet--fallen, "like Lucifer, never to hope again"--as Captain of the little buccaneer,--the DISCOVERY, disguised as atrading-ship, on the Virginian and New England coasts; and lastly, incharge of his leaking prize, a Spanish frigate in West Indian waters,making his way--death-stricken--into the Virginia port of Jamestown,where (July, 1625), he "cast anchor" for the last time, dying, as wefirst found him, a pirate, to whom it had meantime been given to"minister unto saints."Of JOHN CLARKE, the first mate of the MAY-FLOWER, we have already learnedthat he had been in the employ of the First (or London) Virginia Company,and had but just returned (in June, 1620) from a voyage to Virginia withCaptain Jones in the FALCON, when found and employed by Weston andCushman for the Pilgrim ship.  Dr. Neill quotes from the "Minutes of theLondon Virginia Company," of Wednesday, February 13/23, 1621/2, thefollowing; which embodies considerable information concerning him:--"February 13th, 1621.  Master Deputy acquainted the Court, that one MasterJohn Clarke being taken from Virginia long since [Arber interpolates,"in 1612"] by a Spanish ship that came to discover the Plantation, thatforasmuch as he hath since that time done the Company presumably theFirst (or London) Virginia Company good service in many voyages toVirginia; and, of late [1619] went into Ireland, for the transportation ofcattle to Virginia; he was a humble suitor to this Court that he might bea Free brother of the Company, and have some shares of land bestowed uponhim."From the foregoing he seems to have begun his American experiences asearly as 1612, and to have frequently repeated them.  That he was at oncehired by Weston and Cushman as a valuable man, as soon as found, was notstrange.He seems to have had the ability to impress men favorably and securetheir confidence, and to have been a modest and reliable man.  Althoughof both experience and capacity, he continued an under-officer for someyears after the Pilgrim voyage, when, it is fair to suppose, he mighthave had command of a ship.  He seems to have lacked confidence inhimself, or else the breadth of education necessary to make him trust hisability as a navigator.He is not mentioned, in connection with the affairs of the Pilgrims,after he was hired as "pilot,"--on Saturday afternoon the 10th of June,1620, at London,--until after the arrival at Cape Cod, and evidently wassteadily occupied during all the experience of "getting away" and of thevoyage, in the faithful performance of his duty as first mate (or"pilot") of the MAY-FLOWER.  It was not until the "third party" ofexploration from Cape Cod harbor was organized and set out, on Wednesday,December 6, that he appeared as one of the company who put out in theshallop, to seek the harbor which had been commended by Coppin, "thesecond mate."  On this eventful voyage--when the party narrowly escapedshipwreck at the mouth of Plymouth harbor--they found shelter under thelee of an island, which (it being claimed traditionally that he was firstto land there on) was called, in his honor, "Clarke's Island," which nameit retains to this day.  No other mention of him is made by name, in theaffairs of ship or shore, though it is known inferentially that hesurvived the general illness which attacked and carried off half of theship's company.  In November, 1621,--the autumn following his return fromthe Pilgrim voyage,--he seems to have gone to Virginia as "pilot" (or"mate") of the FLYING HART, with cattle of Daniel Gookin, and in 1623 tohave attained command of a ship, the PROVIDENCE, belonging to Mr. Gookin,on a voyage to Virginia where he arrived April 10, 1623, but died in thatcolony soon after his arrival. He seems to have been a competent andfaithful man, who filled well his part in life.  He will always havehonorable mention as the first officer of the historic MAY-FLOWER, and assponsor at the English christening of the smiling islet in Plymouthharbor which bears his name.Of ROBERT COPPIN, the "second mate" (or "pilot") of the MAY-FLOWER,nothing is known before his voyage in the Pilgrim ship, except that heseems to have made a former  to the coast of New England and the vicinityof Cape Cod, though under what auspices, or in what ship, does nottranspire.  Bradford says: "Their Pilotte, one Mr. Coppin, who had beenin the countrie before."  Dr. Young a suggests that Coppin was perhaps onthe coast with Smith or Hunt.  Mrs. Austin imaginatively makes him, of"the whaling bark SCOTSMAN of Glasgow," but no warrant whatever for sucha conception appears.Dr. Dexter, as elsewhere noted, has said: "My impression is that Coppinwas originally hired to go in the SPEEDWELL, .  .  that he sailed withthem [the Pilgrims] in the SPEED WELL, but on her final putting back wastransferred to the MAY-FLOWER."  As we have seen in another relation,Dr. Dexter also believed Coppin to have been the "pilot" sent over byCushman to Leyden, in May, 1620, and we have found both views to beuntenable.  It was doubtless because of this mistaken view that Dr.Dexter believed that Coppin was "hired to go in the SPEEDWELL," and, thepremise being wrong, the conclusion is sequentially incorrect.  But thereare abundant reasons for thinking that Dexter's "impression" is whollymistaken.  It would be unreasonable to suppose (as both vessels wereexpected to cross the ocean), that each had not--certainly on leavingSouthampton her full complement of officers.  If so, each undoubtedly hadher second mate.  The MAY-FLOWER'S officers and crew were, as we know,hired for the voyage, and there is no good reason to suppose that thesecond mate of the MAY-FLOWER was dismissed at Plymouth and Coppin put inhis place which would not be equally potent for such an exchange betweenthe first mate of the SPEEDWELL and Clarke of the MAY-FLOWER.  Theassumption presumes too much.  In fact, there can be no doubt thatDexter's misconception was enbased upon, and arose from, the unwarrantedimpression that Coppin was the "pilot" sent over to Leyden.  It is notlikely that, when the SPEEDWELL'S officers were so evidently anxious toescape the voyage, they would seek transfer to the MAY-FLOWER.Charles Deane, the editor of Bradford's "Historie" (ed.1865), makes, inindexing, the clerical error of referring to Coppin as the "master-gunner," an error doubtless occasioned by the fact that in the textreferred to, the words, "two of the masters-mates, Master Clarke andMaster Coppin, the master-gunner," etc., were run so near together thatthe mistake was readily made.In "Mourt's Relation" it appears that in the conferences that were heldaboard the ship in Cape Cod harbor, as to the most desirable place forthe colonists to locate, "Robert Coppin our pilot, made relation of agreat navigable river and great harbor in the headland of the Bay, almostright over against Cape Cod, being a right line not much above eightleagues distant," etc.  Mrs. Jane G. Austin asserts, though absolutelywithout warrant of any reliable authority, known tradition, orprobability, that "Coppin's harbor .  .  . afterward proved to be CutRiver and the site of Marshfield," but in another place she contradictsthis by stating that it was "Jones River, Duxbury."  As Coppin describedhis putative harbor, called "Thievish Harbor," a "great navigable riverand good harbor" were in close relation, which was never true of eitherthe Jones River or "Cut River" localities, while any one familiar withthe region knows that what Mrs. Austin knew as "Cut River" had noexistence in the Pilgrims' early days, but was the work of man,superseding a small river-mouth (Green Harbor River), which was soshallow as to have its exit closed by the sand-shift of a single storm.Young, with almost equal recklessness, says: "The other headland of thebay, alluded to by Coppin, was Manomet Point, and the river was probablythe North River in Scituate; "but there are no "great navigable river andgood harbor" in conjunction in the neighborhood of Manomet, or of theNorth River,--the former having no river and the latter no harbor.  IfCoppin had not declared that he had never seen the mouth of Plymouthharbor before ("mine eyes never saw this place before"), it might readilyhave been believed that Plymouth harbor was the "Thievish Harbor" of hisdescription, so well do they correspond.Goodwin, the brother of Mrs. Austin, quite at variance with his sister'sconclusions, states, with every probability confirming him, that theharbor Coppin sought "may have been Boston, Ipswich, Newburyport, orPortsmouth."As a result of his "relation" as to a desirable harbor, Coppin was madethe "pilot" of the "third expedition," which left the ship in theshallop, Wednesday, December 6, and, after varying disasters and a narrowescape from shipwreck--through Coppin's mistake--landed Friday nightafter dark, in the storm, on the island previously mentioned, ever sincecalled "Clarke's Island," at the mouth of Plymouth harbor.Nothing further is known of Coppin except that he returned to Englandwith the ship.  He has passed into history only as Robert Coppin, "thesecond mate" (or "pilot") of the MAY-FLOWER.But one other officer in merchant ships of the MAY-FLOWER class in herday was dignified by the address of "Master" (or Mister), or had rankwith the Captain and Mates as a quarter-deck officer,--except in thoseinstances where a surgeon or a chaplain was carried.  That the MAY-FLOWERcarried no special ship's-surgeon has been supposed from the fact of Dr.Fuller's attendance alike on her passengers and crew, and the increasedmortality of the seamen--after his removal on shore.     [The author is greatly indebted to his esteemed friend, Mr. George     Ernest Bowman, Secretary-General of the Society of MAY-FLOWER     Descendants, for information of much value upon this point. He     believes that he has discovered trustworthy evidence of the     existence of a small volume bearing upon its title-page an     inscription that would certainly indicate that the MAY-FLOWER had     her own surgeon. A copy of the inscription, which Mr. Bowman     declares well attested (the book not being within reach), reads as     follows:--               "To Giles Heale Chirurgeon,                         from Isaac Allerton                                   in Virginia.          Feb. 10, 1620."     Giles Heale's name will be recognized as that of one of the     witnesses to John Carver's copy of William Mullens's nuncupative     will, and, if he was the ship's-surgeon, might very naturally appear     in that relation.  If book and inscription exist and the latter is     genuine, it would be indubitable proof that Heale (who was surely     not a MAY-FLOWER passenger) was one of the ship's company, and if a     "chirurgeon," the surgeon of the ship, for no other Englishmen,     except those of the colonists and the ship's company, could have     been at New Plymouth, at the date given, and New England was then     included in the term "Virginia."  It is much to be hoped that Mr.     Bowman's belief may be established, and that in Giles Heale we shall     have another known officer, the surgeon, of the MAY-FLOWER.]That she had no chaplain goes without saying.  The Pilgrims had theirspiritual adviser with them in the person of Elder Brewster, and were notlikely to tolerate a priest of either the English or the Romish church ona vessel carrying them.  The officer referred to was the representativeof the business interests of the owner or chartering-party, on whoseaccount the ship made the voyage; and in that day was known as the"ship's-merchant," later as the "purser," and in some relations as the"supercargo."  No mention of an officer thus designated, belonging to theMAY-FLOWER, has ever been made by any writer, so far as known, and itdevolves upon the author to indicate his existence and to establish, sofar as possible, both this and his identity.A certain "Master Williamson," whose name and presence, though but oncementioned by Governor Bradford, have greatly puzzled Pilgrim historians,seems to have filled this berth on board the MAY-FLOWER.  Bradford tellsus that on Thursday, March 22, 1620/21, "Master Williamson" wasdesignated to accompany Captain Standish--practically as an officerof the guard--to receive and escort the Pokanoket chief, Massasoit,to Governor Carver, on the occasion of the former's first visit of state.Prior to the recent discovery in London, by an American genealogist, of acopy of the nuncupative will of Master William Mullens, one of the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims, clearly dictated to Governor John Carver on board theship, in the harbor of New Plymouth (probably) Wednesday, February 21,1620 (though not written out by Carver till April 2, 1620), on which day(as we learn from Bradford), Master Mullens died, no other mention of"Master Williamson" than that above quoted was known, and his veryexistence was seriously questioned.  In this will, as elsewhere noted,"Master Williamson" is named as one of the "Overseers."  By most earlywriters it was held that Bradford had unwittingly substituted the name"Williamson" for that of Allerton, and this view--apparently for nobetter reasons than that both names had two terminal letters in common,and that Allerton was associated next day with Standish on some militaryduty--came to be generally accepted, and Allerton's name to be evenfrequently substituted without question.---Miss Marcia A. Thomas, in her"Memorials of Marshfield" (p. 75), says: "In 1621, Master Williamson,Captain Standish, and Edward Winslow made a journey to make a treaty withMassasoit.  He is called 'Master George,' meaning probably Master GeorgeWilliamson," etc.This is certainly most absurd, and by one not familiar with theexceptional fidelity and the conscientious work of Miss Thomas wouldrightly be denounced as reckless and reprehensible fabrication.  Ofcourse Williamson, Standish, and Winslow made no such journey, and madeno treaty with Massasoit, but aided simply in conducting, with dueceremonial, the first meeting between Governor John Carver and the Indiansachem at Plymouth, at which a treaty was concluded.  There is nohistorical warrant whatever for the name of "George," as appertaining to"Master William son."  The fact, however,--made known by the fortunatediscovery mentioned,--that "Master Williamson" was named in his will byMaster Mullens as one of its "Overseers," and undoubtedly probated thewill in England, puts the existence of such a person beyond reasonabledoubt. That he was a person of some dignity, and of very respectableposition, is shown by the facts that he was chosen as Standish'sassociate, as lieutenant of the guard, on an occasion of so muchimportance, and was thought fit by Master Mullens, a careful and clear-headed man as his will proves,--to be named an "Overseer" of that will,charged with responsible duties to Mullens's children and property.It is  practically certain that on either of the above-mentioned dates(February 21, or March 22) there were no human beings in the Colony ofNew Plymouth beside the passengers of the MAY-FLOWER, her officers andcrew, and the native savages.  Visitors, by way of the fishing vessels onthe Maine coast, had not yet begun to come, as they did a little later.It is certain that no one of the name of "Williamson" was among thecolonist passengers, or indeed for several years in the colony, and wemay at once dismiss both the passengers and the savages from ourconsideration.  This elimination renders it inevitable that "MasterWilliamson" must have been of the ship's company.  It remains todetermine, if possible, what position upon the MAY-FLOWER'S roster hepresumably held. His selection by "Master" Mullens as one of the "Overseers" of his will suggests the probability that, having named GovernorCarver as the one upon whom he would rely for the care of his family andaffairs in New England, Mr. Mullens sought as the other a proper person,soon to return to England, and hence able to exercise like personalinterest in his two children and his considerable property left there?Such a suggestion points to a returning and competent officer of theship.  That "Master Williamson" was above the grade of "petty officer,"and ranked at least with the mates or "pilots," is clear from the factthat he is invariably styled "Master" (equivalent to Mister), and we knowwith certainty that he was neither captain nor mate. That he was a man ofaddress and courage follows the fact that he was chosen by Standish ashis lieutenant, while the choice in and of itself is a strong bit ofpresumptive proof that he held the position on the MAY-FLOWER to which heis here assigned.The only officer commonly carried by a ship of the MAY-FLOWER class,whose rank, capacities, and functions would comport with every fact andfeature of the case, was "the ship's-merchant," her accountant, factor,and usually--when such was requisite--her "interpreter," on everyconsiderable (trading) voyage.It is altogether probable that it was in his capacity of "interpreter"(as Samoset and Tisquantum knew but little English), and on account ofwhat knowledge of the Indian tongue he very probably possessed, thatStandish chose Williamson as his associate for the formal reception ofMassasoit.  It is indeed altogether probable that it was this familiaritywith the "trade lingo" of the American coast tribes which influenced--perhaps determined--his employ ment as "ship's-merchant" of the MAY-FLOWER for her Pilgrim voyage, especially as she was expected to "loadback" for England with the products of the country, only to be had bybarter with the Indians.  It is evident that there must naturally havebeen some provision made for communication with the natives, for thepurposes of that trade, etc., which the Planters hoped to establish.Trading along the northern coast of Virginia (as the whole coast stripwas then called), principally for furs, had been carried on prettyactively, since 1584, by such navigators as Raleigh's captains, Gosnold,Pring, Champlain, Smith, Dermer, Hunt, and the French and Dutch, and muchof the "trade lingo" of the native tribes had doubtless been "picked up"by their different "ship's-merchants."  It appears by Bradford' thatDermer, when coasting the shores of New England, in Sir FerdinandoGorges's employ, brought the Indian Tisquantum with him, from England,as his interpreter, and doubtless from him Dermer and other ship'sofficers "picked up" more or less Indian phrases, as Tisquantum (Squanto)evidently did of English.  Winslow, in his "Good Newes from New England,"written in 1622, says of the Indian tongue, as spoken by the tribes aboutthem at Plymouth, "it is very copious, large, and difficult.  As yet wecannot attain to any great measure thereof, but can understand them, andexplain ourselves to their understanding, by the help of those that dailyconverse with us."  This being the case, after two years of constantcommunication, and noting how trivial knowledge of English speech Samosetand Tisquantum had, it is easy to understand that, if Williamson had anyknowledge of the native tongue, Standish would be most anxious to havethe benefit of it, in this prime and all-important effort at securing apermanent alliance with the ruling sachem of the region.  Bradford, in"Mourt's Relation," speaking of the speech of Governor Carver toMassasoit, says: "He [Massasoit] liked well of the speech and heard itattentively, though the interpreters did not well express it."  Probablyall three, Tisquantum, Samoset, and Williamson, had a voice in it.That "Master Williamson" was a veritable person at New Plymouth, inFebruary and March, 1620/21, is now beyond dispute; that he must havebeen of the ship's company of the MAY-FLOWER is logically certain; thathe was one of her officers, and a man of character, is proven by histitle of "Master" and his choice by Standish and Mullens for exceptionaland honorable service; that the position of "ship's-merchant" aloneanswers to the conditions precedent, is evident; and that such an officerwas commonly carried by ships of the MAY-FLOWER class on such voyages ashers is indicated by the necessity, and proven by the facts known as toother ships on similar New England voyages, both earlier and later.  Thefact that he was called simply "Master Williamson," in both cases wherehe is mentioned, with out other designation or identification, is highlysignificant, and clearly indicates that he was some one so familiarlyknown to all concerned that no occasion for any further designationapparently occurred to the minds of Mullens, Carver, or Bradford, whenreferring to him.  In the case of Master John Hampden, the only othernotable incognito of early Pilgrim literature, the description is full,and the only question concerning him has been of his identity with JohnHampden, the English patriot of the Cromwellian era.  It is, therefore,not too much to assert that the MAY-FLOWER carried a "ship's-merchant"(or purser), and that "Master Williamson" was that officer.  If close-linked circumstantial evidence is ever to be relied upon, it clearlyestablishes in this case the identity of the "Master Williamson" who wasGovernor Bradford's incognito, and the person of the same name mentioneda month earlier in "Master" Mullens's will; as also the fact that in himwe have a new officer of the MAY FLOWER, hitherto unknown as such toPilgrim literature.  If Mr. Bowman's belief as to Giles Heale (see note)proves correct, we have yet another, the Surgeon.The Carpenter, Gunner, Boatswain, Quartermaster, and "Masters-mates" arethe only "petty officers" of the Pilgrim ship of whom any record makesmention.  The carpenter is named several times, and was evidently, asmight be expected, one of the most useful men of the ship's crew.  Calledinto requisition, doubtless, in the conferences as to the condition ofthe SPEEDWELL, on both of her returns to port, at the inception of thevoyage, he was especially in evidence when, in mid-ocean, "the crackingand bending of a great deck-beam," and the "shaken" condition of "theupper works" of the MAY-FLOWER, gave rise to much alarm, and it was byhis labors and devices, and the use of the now famous "jack-screw," thatthe bending beam and leaking deck were made secure.  The repairs upon theshallop in Cape Cod harbor also devolved upon him, and mention is made ofhis illness and the dependence placed upon him. No doubt, in theconstruction of the first dwellings and of the ordnance platform on thehill, etc., he was the devising and principal workman.  He undoubtedlyreturned to England with the ship, and is known in history only by his"billet," as "the carpenter" of the MAY-FLOWER.The Master Gunner seems to have been a man with a proclivity for Indianbarter, that led him to seek a place with the "third expedition" at CapeCod, thereby nearly accomplishing his death, which indeed occurred later,in Plymouth harbor, not long before the return of the ship.The Boatswain is known, by Bradford's records, to have died in thegeneral sickness which attacked the crew while lying in Plymouth harbor.The brief narrative of his sickness and death is all that we know of hispersonality.  The writer says: "He was a proud young man, and would oftencurse and scoff at the passengers," but being nursed when dying, by thoseof them who remained aboard, after his shipmates had deserted him intheir craven fear of infection, "he bewailed his former conduct," saying,"Oh! you, I now see, show your love like Christians indeed, one toanother, but we let one another lie and die like dogs."Four Quartermasters are mentioned (probably helmsmen simply), of whomthree are known to have died in Plymouth harbor."Masters-mates" are several times mentioned, but it is pretty certainthat the "pilots" (or mates) are intended. Bradford and Winslow, in"Mourt's Relation," say of the reappearance of the Indians: "So CaptainStandish, with another [Hopkins], with their muskets, went over to them,with two of the masters-mates that follow them without [side?] arms,having two muskets with them: Who these "masters-mates" were does notappear."  The language, "two of the masters-mates," would possibly suggestthat there were more of them.  It hardly seems probable that both themates of the MAY-FLOWER would thus volunteer, or thrust themselvesforward in such a matter, and it seems doubtful if they would have beenpermitted (even if both ashore at one time, which, though unusual, didoccur), to assume such duty. Whoever they were, they did not lackcourage.The names of the petty officers and seamen of the MAY-FLOWER do notappear as such, but the discovery of the (evidently) nuncupative will ofWilliam Mullens--herein referred to--has perhaps given us two of them.Attached to John Carver's certificate of the particulars of this will,filed at Somerset House, London, are the names, "Giles Heale" and"Christopher Joanes."  As Mr Mullens died Wednesday, February 21, 1620,on board the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor, on which day we know fromBradford' that "the Master [Jones, whose name was Thomas] came on shorewith many of his sailors," to land and mount the cannon on the fort, andas they had a full day's work to draw up the hill and mount five guns,and moreover brought the materials for, and stayed to eat, a considerabledinner with the Pilgrims, they were doubtless ashore all day.  It isrational to interpret the known facts to indicate that in this absence ofthe Captain and most of his crew ashore, Mr. Mullens, finding himselffailing fast, sent for Governor Carver and--unable to do more than speak--dictated to him the disposition of his property which he desired tomake.  Carver, noting this down from his dictation, undoubtedly called intwo of the ship's company (Heale very likely being the ship's-surgeon),who were left aboard to "keep ship," to hear his notes read to Mullensand assented to by him, they thus becoming the witnesses to his will, tothe full copy of which, as made by Carver (April 2), they affixed theirnames as such.  As there were then at Plymouth (besides savages) only thepassengers and crew of the MAY-FLOWER, and these men were certainly notamong the passengers, it seems inevitable that they were of the crew.That "Christopher Joanes" was not the Master of the ship is clear,because Heale's is the first signature, and no man of the crew would havedared to sign before the Captain; because the Captain's name was (asdemonstrated) Thomas; and because we know that he was ashore all thatday, with most of his men.  It is by no means improbable that CaptainJones had shipped one of his kinsmen in his crew, possibly as one of the"masters mates" or quartermasters referred to (and it is by no meanscertain that there were not more than two), though these witnesses mayhave been quartermasters or other petty officers left on board as "ship-keepers."  Certain it is that these two witnesses must have been of thecrew, and that "Christopher Joanes" was not the Captain, while it isequally sure, from the collateral evidence, that Master Mullens died onshipboard.  Had he died on shore it is very certain that some of theleaders, Brewster, Bradford, or others, would have been witnesses, withsuch of the ship's officers as could aid in proving the will in England.It is equally evident that the officers of the ship were absent whenMaster Mullens dictated his will, except perhaps the surgeon.The number of seamen belonging to the ship is nowhere definitely stated.At least four in the employ of the Pilgrims were among the passengersand not enrolled upon the ships' lists.  From the size of the ship,the amount of sail she probably carried, the weight of her anchors,and certain other data which appear,--such as the number allowed toleave the ship at a time, etc.,--it is probably not a wild estimate toplace their number at from twenty to twenty-five. This is perhaps asomewhat larger number than would be essential to work the ship, and thanwould have been shipped if the voyage had been to any port of a civilizedcountry; but on a voyage to a wild coast, the possibilities of longabsence and of the weakening of the crew by death, illness, etc.,demanded consideration and a larger number.  The wisdom and necessityof carrying, on a voyage to an uninhabited country, some spare men,is proven by the record of Bradford, who says: "The disease begane tofall amongst them the seamen also, so as allmost halfe of their companydyed before they went away and many of their officers and lustyest men;as ye boatson, gunner, 3 quarter maisters, the cooke, and others."The LADY ARBELLA, the "Admiral" of Governor Winthrop's fleet, a ship of350 tons, carried 52 men, and it is a fair inference that the MAY-FLOWER,of a little more than half her tonnage, would require at least half asmany. It is, therefore, not unlikely that the officers and crew of theMAY-FLOWER, all told, mustered thirty men, irrespective of the sailors,four in number (Alderton, English, Trevore, and Ely), in the Pilgrims'employ.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:As 1620 did not begin until March 25Crime--for such it was, in inception, nature, and resultsMalevolence rarely exercised except toward those one has wrongedThe old adage, "second thief best owner"Theft of the MAY-FLOWER colonyEnd of this Project Gutenberg Etext of The Mayflower and Her Log, v3by Azel Ames

Butnot long after, as I was walking,and musing on these thoughts, Ibegan to honour this creature ofGod, thinking with myself; hownoble and beautiful she was.3  And when I had walked a little,I fell asleep; and the spiritcaught me away, and carried methrough a certain place towardsthe right hand, through which noman could pass. It was a placeamong rocks, very steep, andunpassable for water.4  When I was past this place,I came into a plain; and therefalling down upon my knees, Ibegan to pray unto the Lord, andto confess my sins.5  And as I was praying, theheaven was opened, and I saw thewoman which I had coveted,saluting me from heaven, andsaying, Hermas, hail! and I lookingupon her, answered, Lady, whatdost thou do here? She answeredme, I am taken up hither to accusethee of sin before the Lord.6  Lady, said I, wilt thouconvince me? No, said she: buthear the words which I am aboutto speak unto thee. God whodwelleth in heaven, and hath madeall things out of nothing, andhath multiplied them for his holychurch's sake, is angry with theebecause thou hast sinned againstme.7  And I answering said untoher, Lady, if I have sinned againstthee, tell me where, or in whatplace, or when did I ever speakan unseemly or dishonest wordunto thee?8  Have I not always esteemedthee as a lady? Have I not alwaysreverenced thee as a sister? Whythen dost thou imagine thesewicked things against me?9  Then she, smiling upon me,said: the desire of naughtinesshas risen up in thy heart. Doesit not seem to thee to be an illthing for a righteous man to havean evil desire rise up in his heart.10  It is indeed a sin, and that avery great sin, to such a one; fora righteous man thinketh thatwhich is righteous. And whilsthe does so, and walketh uprightly,he shall have the Lord in heavenfavourable unto him in all hisbusiness.11  But as for those who thinkwickedly in their hearts, they taketo themselves death and captivity;and especially those who love thispresent world, and glory in theirriches, and regard not the goodthings that are to come; theirsouls wander up and down andknow not where to fix.12  Now this is the case of suchas are double-minded, who trustnot in the Lord, and despise andneglect their own life.13  But do thou pray unto theLord, and he will heal thy sins,and the sins of thy whole house,and of all his saints.14  As soon as she had spokenthese words the heaven were shut,and I remained utterly swallowedup with sadness and fear: andsaid within myself, if this be laidagainst me for sin, how can I besaved.15  Or how should I ever be ableto entreat the Lord for my manyand great sins? With what wordsshall I beseech him to be mercifulunto me?16  As I was thinking over thesethings, and meditating in myselfupon them, behold a chair wasset over against me of the whitestwool, as bright as snow.17  And there came an old womanin a bright garment, havinga book in her hand, and sat alone,and saluted me, saying, Hermas,hail! and I being full of sorrowand weeping, answered, Hail Lady!18  And she said unto me, Whyart thou sad, Hermas, who wertwont to be patient, and modest,and always cheerful? I answered,and said to her, Lady, a reproachhas been laid to my charge by anexcellent woman, who tells methat I have sinned against her.19  She replied, Far be any suchthing from the servant of God.But it may be the desire of herhas risen up in thy heart? Forindeed such a thought maketh theservants of God guilty of sin.20  Nor ought such a detestablethought to be in the servant ofGod: nor should he who is approvedby the Spirit desire that whichis evil; but especially Hermas,who contains himself from allwicked lusts, and is full of allsimplicity, and of great innocence.21  Nevertheless the Lord isnot so much angry with thee forthine own sake, as upon theaccount of thy house, which hascommitted wickedness against theLord, and against their parents.22  And for that out of thyfondness towards thy sons, thouhast not admonished thy house,but hast permitted them to livewickedly; for this cause the Lordis angry with thee: but he will healall the evils that are done in thyhouse. For through their sinsand iniquities, thou art whollyconsumed in secular affairs.23  But now the mercy of Godhath taken compassion upon thee,and upon thine house, and hathgreatly comforted thee. Onlyas for thee, do not wander, but beof an even mind, and comfort thyhouse.24  As the workman bringingforth his work, offers it towhomsoever he pleaseth; so shaltthou by teaching every day whatis just, cut off a great sin.Wherefore cease not to admonish thysons, for the Lord knows that theywill repent with all their heart,and they shall be written in thebook of life.25  And when she had said this,she added unto me; Wilt thouhear me read? I answered her,Lady, I will.26  Hear then, said she;and opening the book she read,gloriously, greatly. and wonderfully,such things as I could not keep inmy memory. For they were terriblewords, such as no man could bear.27  How it be I committed herlast words to my remembrance;for they were but few, and of greatuse to us:--28  Behold the mighty Lord, whoby his invisible power, and withhis excellent wisdom made theworld, and by his glorious counselbeautified his creature, and withthe word of his strength fixed theheaven, and founded the earthupon the waters; and by hispowerful virtue established theHoly Church, which he hathblessed.29  Behold he will remove theheavens, and the mountains, thehills, and the seas; and all thingsshall be made plain for his elect;that he may render unto them thepromise which he has promised,with much honour and joy; if sobe that they shall keep thecommandments of God, which theyhave received with great faith.30  And when she had made an endof reading, she rose out of thechair; and behold four young mencame, and carried the chair tothe east.31  And she called me unto her,and touched my breast, and saidunto me, Did my reading pleasethee? I answered, Lady, theselast things please me; but whatwent before was severe and hard.32  She said unto me, these lastthings are for the righteous, butthe foregoing for the revolters andheathen.33  And as she was talking withme, two men appeared, and tookher upon their shoulders, andwent to the east where the chairwas.34  And she went cheerfullyaway; and as she was going, saidunto me, Hermas, be of goodcheer.VISION II.     Again, of his neglect in correcting his talkative wife;     and of his lewd sons.AS I was on the way to Cuma,about the same time that Iwent the year before, I began tocall to mind the vision I formerlyhad. And again the spirit carriedme away, and brought me into thesame place, in which I had beenthe year before.2  And when I was come into theplace, I fell down upon my knees,and began to pray unto the Lord,and to glorify his name, that hehad esteemed me worthy, and hadmanifested unto me my formersins.3  And when I arose from prayer,behold I saw over against me theold woman whom I had seen thelast year, walking and readingin a certain book.4  And she said unto me, Canstthou tell these things to theelect of God? I answered and saidunto her, Lady, I cannot retainso many things in my memory, butgive me the book, and I will writethem down.5  Take it, says she, and see thatthou restore it again to me.6  As soon as I had received it,I went aside into a certain placeof the field, and transcribe everyletter, for I found no syllables.7  And as soon as I had finishedwhat was written in the book, thebook was suddenly caught out ofmy hand, but by whom I saw not.8  After fifteen days, when Ihad fasted, and entreated the Lordwith all earnestness, the knowledgeof the writing was revealed unto me.Now the writing was this:--9  Thy seed, O Hermas! hathsinned against the Lord, and havebetrayed their parents, throughtheir great wickedness. And theyhave been called the betrayers oftheir parents, and have gone on intheir treachery.10  And now have they addedlewdness to their other sins, andthe pollutions of their naughtiness:thus have they filled up the measureof their iniquities. But do thouupbraid thy sons with all thesewords; and thy wife, who shall beas thy sister; and let her learnto refrain her tongue, with whichshe calumniates.11  And when she shall hear thesethings, she will refrain herself,and shall obtain mercy.12  And they also shall beinstructed, when thou shalt havereproached them with these words,which the Lord has commanded tobe revealed unto them.13  Then shall their sins beforgiven, which they have heretoforecommitted, and the sins of all thesaints who have sinned even untothis day; if they shall repent withall their hearts, and remove alldoubts out of their hearts.14  For the Lord hath sworn byhis glory concerning his elect,having determined this very time,that if any one shall even nowsin, he shall not be saved.15  For the repentance of therighteous has its end; the days ofrepentance are fulfilled to all thesaints; but to the heathen, thereis repentance even unto the lastday.16  Thou shalt therefore say tothose who are over the church,that they order their ways inrighteousness; so that they mayfully receive the promise withmuch glory.17  Stand fast therefore ye thatwork righteousness and continueto do it, that your departure maybe with the holy angels.18  Happy are ye, as many asshall endure the great trial that isat hand, and whosoever shall notdeny his life.19  For the Lord hath sworn byhis Son, that whoso, denieth hisSon and HIM, being afraid of hislife, he will also deny him in theworld that is to come.20  But those who shall neverdeny him, he will of his exceedinggreat mercy be favourable untothem.21 But thou, O Hermas! remembernot the evils which thy sons havedone, neither neglect thy sister,but take care that they amend oftheir former sins.22  For they will be instructedby this doctrine, if thou shalt notbe mindful of what they have donewickedly.23  For the remembrance of evilsworketh death, but the forgettingof them eternal life.24  But thou, O Hermas! hastundergone a great many worldlytroubles for the offences of thyhouse, because thou hast neglectedthem, as things that did not belongunto thee; and thou art whollytaken up with thy great business.25  Nevertheless, for this causeshalt thou be saved, that thou hastnot departed from the living God,and thy simplicity and singularcontinency shall preserve thee, ifthou shalt continue in them.26  Yes, they shall save all suchas do such things, and walk ininnocence and simplicity.27 They who are of this kindshall prevail against all impiety,and continue until life eternal.28  Happy are all they that dorighteousness, they shall not beconsumed for ever.29  But thou wilt say, Beholdthere is a great trial coming. Ifit seem good to thee, deny himagain.30  The Lord is nigh to them thatturn to him, as it is written inthe book of Heldam and Modal,who prophesied to the people ofIsrael in the wilderness.31  Moreover, brethren, it wasrevealed to me, as I was sleeping,by a very goodly young man, sayingunto me, What thinkest thou of thatold woman from whom thou receivedstthe book; who is she? I answered,a Sybil.32  Thou art mistaken said he,she is not. I replied, Who is shethen, sir? He answered me, It isthe church of God.33  And I said unto him, Whythen does she appear old? She istherefore, said he, an old woman,because she was the first of allthe creation, and the world wasmade for her.34  After this I saw a vision athome in my own house, and theold woman, whom I had seen before,came to me and asked me whetherI had yet delivered her book tothe elders of the church? AndI answered, that I had not yet.35  She replied, Thou hast welldone, for I have certain wordsmore to tell thee. But when Ishall have finished all the words,they shall be clearly understoodby the elect.36 And thou shalt write twobooks, and send one to Clementand one to Grapte. For Clementshall send it to the foreign cities,because it is permitted to him soto do: but Grapte shall admonishthe widows and orphans.37  But thou shalt read in thiscity with the elders of the church.VISION III.     Of the building of the church triumphant,     and of the several sorts of reprobates.THE vision which I saw, brethren,was this.2  When I had often fasted andprayed unto the Lord, that hewould manifest unto me therevelation, which he had promisedby the old woman to show unto me;the same night she appeared untome, and said unto me,3  Because thou dost thus afflictthyself, and art so desirous to knowall things, come into the field,where thou wilt, and about thesixth hour, I will appear unto thee,and show thee what thou mustsee.4  I asked her, saying; Lady,into what part of the field? Sheanswered, wherever thou wilt, onlychoose a good and a private place.And before I began to speak andtell her the place, she said untome; I will come where thou wilt.5  I was therefore, brethren inthe field and I observed the hours,and came into the place where Ihad appointed her to come.6  And I beheld a bench placed;it was a linen pillow, and over itspread a covering of fine linen.7  When I saw these things orderedin this manner, and that there wasnobody in the place, I began to beastonished, and my hair stood on end,and a, kind of horror seized me;for I was alone.8  But being come to myself,and calling to mind the glory ofGod, and taking courage, I felldown upon my knees and beganagain to confess my sins as before.9  And whilst I was doing this,the old woman came thither withthe six young men whom I hadseen before, and stood behind meas I was praying, and heard mepraying and confessing my sinsunto the Lord.10  And touching me, she said;Leave off praying now only for thysins; pray also for righteousness,that thou mayest receive a part ofit in thy house.11  And she lifted me up fromthe place, and took me by thehand, and brought me to the seat;and said to the young men, go,and build.12  As soon as they were departed,and we were alone, she said unto me;sit here. I answered her; Lady,let those who are elder sit first.She replied, Sit down as I bid you.13  And when I would have saton the right side, she suffered menot, but made a sign to me withher hand, that I should sit on theleft.14  As I was therefore musing,and full of sorrow, that she wouldnot suffer me to sit on the rightside, she said unto me, Hermas,why art thou sad?15  The place which is on theright hand is theirs who havealready attained unto God, and havesuffered for his name-sake. Butthere is yet a great deal remainingunto thee, before thou canst sitwith them.16  But continue as thou doest,in thy sincerity, and thou shalt sitwith them; as all others shall,who do their works, and shall bearwhat they have borne.17  I said to her; Lady, I wouldknow what it is that they havesuffered? Hear then, said she:wild beasts, scourgings,imprisonments, and crossesfor his name-sake.18  For this cause the right handof holiness belongs to them, andto all others as many as shallsuffer for the name of God; butthe left belongs to the rest.19  Howbeit the gifts and thepromises belong to both, to themon the right, and to those on theleft hand; only that sitting on theright hand they have some gloryabove the others.20  But thou art desirous to siton the right hand with them, andyet thy defects are many. Butthou shalt be purged from thydefects, as also all who doubt notshall be cleansed from all the sinswhich they have committed untothis day.21  And when she had said thisshe would have departed.22  Wherefore, falling down beforeher feet, I began to entreat her,for the Lord's sake, that shewould show me the vision whichshe had promised.23  Then she again took me bythe hand, and lifted me up, andmade me sit upon the seat at theleft side; and holding up a certainbright wand, said unto me, Seestthou that great thing? I replied,Lady, I see nothing.24  She answered, Dost thou notsee over against thee a great tower,which is built upon the water withbright square stones?25  For the tower was built upona square by these six young menthat came with her.26  But many thousand of othermen brought stones; some drewthem out of the deep, otherscarried them from the ground,and gave them to the six young men;and they took them and built.27  As for those stones whichwere drawn out of the deep, theyput them all into the building;for they were polished, and theirsquares exactly answered one another,and so one was joined in such wiseto the other, that there was nospace to be seen where theyjoined, insomuch that the wholetower appeared to be built as itwere of one stone.28  But as for the other stonesthat were taken off from theground, some of them they rejected,others they fitted into the building.29  As for those which were rejected,some they cut out, and cast themat a distance from the tower;but many others of them lay roundabout the tower, which they madeno use of in the building.30  For some of these wererough, others had clefts in them,others were white and round, notproper for the building of thetower.31  But I saw the other stonescast afar off from the tower, andfalling into the high-way, and yetnot continuing in the way, butwere rolled from the way into adesert place.32  Others I saw falling into thefire and burning; others fell nearthe water, yet could not rollthemselves into it, though verydesirous to fall into the water.33  And when she had showedme these things she would havedeparted; but I said to her, Lady,what doth it profit me to see thesethings, and not understand whatthey mean?34  She answered and said untome; You are very cunning, inthat you are desirous to knowthose things which relate to thetower. Yea, said I, lady, that Imay declare them unto the brethren,and they may rejoice, and hearingthese things may glorify Godwith great glory.35  Then she said, Many indeedshall hear them, and when theyshall have heard them, some shallrejoice, and others weep. Andyet even these, if they shallrepent, shall rejoice too.36  Hear therefore what I shallsay concerning the parable of thetower, and after this be no longerimportunate with me about therevelation.37  For these revelations havean end, seeing they are fulfilled.But thou dost not leave off todesire revelations, for thou artvery urgent.38  As for the tower which thouseest built, it is myself, namely,the church, which have appearedto thee both now and heretofore.Wherefore ask what thou wiltconcerning the tower, and I willreveal it unto thee, that thoumayest rejoice with the saints.39  I said unto her, Lady,because thou hast thought me onceworthy to receive from thee therevelation of all these things,declare them unto me.40  She answered me, Whatsoeveris fit to be revealed unto theeshall be revealed: only yet thyheart be with the Lord, and doubtnot, whatsoever thou shalt see.41  I asked her, Lady, why is thetower built upon the water? Shereplied, I said before to thee thatthou wert very wise to inquirediligently concerning the building,therefore thou shalt find the truth.42  Hear therefore why the toweris built upon the water: becauseyour life is and shall be saved bywater. For it is founded by theword of the almighty and honourablename, and is supported by theinvisible power and virtue of God.43 And I answering, saidunto her, These things are veryadmirable; but, lady, who arethose six young men that build?44  They are, said she, the angelsof God, who were first appointed,and to whom the Lord has deliveredall his creatures, to frame andbuild them up, and to rule overthem. For by these the buildingof the tower shall be finished.45  And who are the rest whobring them stones?46  They also are the holy angelsof the Lord; but the others aremore excellent than these. Whereforewhen the whole building of thetower shall be finished, theyshall all feast together besidethe tower, and shall glorify God,because the structure of thetower is finished.47  I asked her, saying, I wouldknow the condition of the stones,and what the meaning of themis?48  She answering, said untome, Art thou better than all othersthat this should be revealed untothee? For others are both beforethee and better than thou art,to whom these visions should bemade manifest.49  Nevertheless, that the nameof God may be glorified, it has beenshown and shall be revealed untothee, for the sake of those who aredoubtful, and think in their heartswhether these things are so or not.50  Tell them that all thesethings are true, and that there isnothing in them that is not truebut all are firm and trulyestablished.51  Hear now then concerningthe stones that are in the building.52  The square and white stoneswhich agree exactly in their joints,are the apostles, and bishops, anddoctors, and ministers, whothrough the mercy of God havecome in, and governed, and taughtand ministered holily and modestlyto the elect of God, both theythat have fallen asleep, and whichyet remain; and have alwaysagreed with them, and have hadpeace within themselves, and haveheard each other.53  For which cause their jointsexactly meet together in the buildingof the tower.54  They which are drawn outof the deep and put into thebuilding, and whose joints agreewith the other stones which arealready built, are those which arealready fallen asleep, and havesuffered for the sake of the Lord'sname.55  And what are the otherstones, lady, that are broughtfrom the earth? I would knowwhat are they.56  She answered, They whichlie upon the ground and are notpolished, are those which God hasapproved, because they havewalked in I the law of the Lord,and directed their ways in hiscommandments.57 They which are brought andput in the building of the tower,are the young in faith and thefaithful. And these are admonishedby the angels to do well becauseiniquity is not found in them.58  But who are those whom theyrejected, and laid beside the tower?59  They are such as have sinnedand are willing to repent; forwhich cause they are not cast farfrom the tower, because they willbe useful for the building, if theyshall repent.60  They therefore that are yetto repent, if they repent they shallbecome strong in the faith; thatis, if they repent now, whilst thetower is building. For if thebuilding shall be finished therewill then be no place for them tobe put in, but they shall be rejected;for he only has this privilege whoshall now be put into the tower.61   But would you know whothey are that were cut out, andcast afar off from the tower?Lady said I, I desire it.62  They are the children of iniquity,who believed only in hypocrisy,and departed not from  their evilways; for this cause they shall notbe saved, because they are not ofany use in the building by reasonof their sins.63 Wherefore they are cut out,and cast afar off, because of theanger of the Lord, and becausethey have provoked him to angeragainst them.64  As for the great number ofother stones which thou hast seenplaced about the tower, but nowput into the building; those whichare rugged, are they who haveknown the truth, but have notcontinued in it, nor been joinedto the saints, and therefore areunprofitable.65  Those that have clefts inthem, are they that keep up discordin their hearts against each other,and live not in peace; that arefriendly when present with theirbrethren, but as soon as they aredeparted from one another, theirwickedness still continues intheir hearts: these are the cleftswhich are seen in those stones.66  Those that are maimed andshort, are they who have believedindeed, but still are in greatmeasure full of wickedness; forthis cause they are maimed andnot whole.67  But what are the white andround stones, lady, and which arenot proper for the building of thetower?68  She answering said untome: How long wilt thou continuefoolish and without understanding,asking everything and discerningnothing?69  They are such as have faithindeed, but have withal the richesof this present world. Whentherefore any troubles arise, forthe sake of their riches and traffic,they deny the Lord.70  I answering, said unto her,When therefore will they beprofitable to the Lord? When theirriches shall be cut away, says she,in which they take delight, thenthey will be profitable unto theLord for his building.71  For as a round stone, unlessit be cut away and is cast somewhatof its bulk, cannot be made square,so they who are rich in this world;unless their riches be pared off;cannot be made profitable unto theLord.72  Learn this from thy ownexperience: when thou wert rich,thou wast unprofitable; but nowthou art profitable, and fit for thelife which thou hast undertaken;for thou also once was one ofthose stones.73 As for the rest of the stoneswhich thou sawest cast afaroff from the tower, and running inthe way, and tumbled out of theway into desert places; they aresuch as have believed indeed,but through their doubting haveforsaken the true way, thinking thatthey could find a better. But theywander and are miserable, goinginto desolate ways.74  Then for those stones whichfell into the fire and were burnt,they are those who have for everdeparted from the living God;nor doth it ever come into theirhearts to repent, by reason of theaffection which they bear to theirlusts and wickedness which theycommit.75  And what are the rest whichfell by the water, and could notroll into the water?76  They are such as have heardthe word, and were willing to bebaptised in the name of the Lord;but considering the great holinesswhich the truth requires, havewithdrawn themselves, an walkedagain after wicked lusts.77  Thus she finished theexplanation of the tower.78 But I being still urgent,asked her, Is there repentanceallowed to all those stones whichare thus cast away, and were notsuitable to the building of thetower; and shall they find placein this tower?79  They may repent, said she,yet they cannot come into thistower; but, they shall be placedin a much lower rank, and thenonly after they shall have beenafflicted and fulfilled the days oftheir sins.80  And for this cause they shallbe removed, because they havereceived the word of righteousness:and then they shall be translatedfrom their afflictions, if theyshall have a true sense in theirhearts of what they have done amiss.81  But if they shall not havethis sense in their hearts, theyshall not be saved by reason ofthe hardness of their hearts.82  When therefore I had doneasking her concerning all thesethings, she said unto me, Wiltthou see something else? Andbeing desirous of seeing it,I became very cheerful ofcountenances.83  She therefore looking backupon me, and smiling a little, saidunto me, Seest thou seven womenabout the tower? Lady, said I,I see them.84  This tower, replied she, issupported by them, according tothe command of the Lord: heartherefore the effects of them.85  The first of them, whichholds fast with her hand, is calledFaith; The next, which is girtup, and looks manly, is namedAbstinence: she is the daughterof Faith.86  Whosoever therefore shallfollow her shall be happy in allhis life, because he shall abstainfrom all evil works, believing thatif he shall contain himself fromall concupiscence, he shall bethe heir of eternal life. Andwhat, lady, said I, are the otherfive?87  They are, replied she, thedaughters of one another. Thefirst of them is called Simplicity;the next Innocence; the thirdModesty; then Discipline; andthe last of all is Charity. Whentherefore thou shalt have fulfilledthe works of their mother, thoushalt be able to do all things.88  Lady, said I, I would knowwhat particular virtue every oneof these has.89  Hear then, replied she;they have equal virtues, and theirvirtues are knit together, andfollow one another as they wereborn.90  From Faith proceeds Abstinence;from Abstinence, Simplicity; fromSimplicity, Innocence; from Innocence,Modesty; from Modesty, Disciplineand Charity. Therefore the worksof these are holy, and chaste, andright.91  Whoever therefore shallserve these, and hold fast to theirworks, he shall have his dwellingin the tower with the saints ofGod.92  Then I asked her concerningthe times, whether the end werenow at hand?93  But she cried out with a loudvoice, saying, O foolish man!Dost thou not see the tower yet abuilding? When therefore thetower shall be finished, and built,it shall have an end; and indeedit shall soon be accomplished.94  But do not ask me any morequestions. What has been saidmay suffice thee and all the saintsfor the refreshment of your spirits.For these things have not beenrevealed to thee only, but thatthou mayest make them manifestunto all.95  For therefore, O Hermas,after three days thou must understandthese words which I beginto speak unto thee, that thoumayest speak them in the ears ofthe saints; that when thou shallhave heard and done them, theymay be cleansed from theiriniquities, and thou togetherwith them.96  Hear me therefore, O mysons! I have bred you up in muchsimplicity, and innocency, andmodesty, for the love of God,which has dropped down uponyou in righteousness, that youshould be sanctified and justifiedfrom all sin and wickedness; butye will not cease from your evildoings.97  Now therefore hearken untome, and have peace one with another,and visit one another, and receiveone another, and do not enjoythe creatures of God alone.98  Give freely to them that arein need. For some by too freefeeding contract an infirmity intheir flesh, and do injury to theirbodies; whilst the flesh of others,who have not food, withers away,because they want sufficientnourishment, and the bodies areconsumed.99  Wherefore this intemperanceis hurtful to you, who have, anddo not contribute to them thatwant. Prepare for the judgmentthat is about to come upon you.100  Ye that are the more eminent,search out them that are hungry,whilst the tower is yet unfinished.For when the tower shall be finished,ye shall be willing to do good,and shall not find any place in it.101  Beware, therefore, ye thatglory in your riches, lest perhapsthey groan who are in want, andtheir sighing come up unto God,and ye be shut out with your goodswithout the gate of the tower.102  Behold I now warn you whoare set over the church, and lovethe highest seats, be not ye likeunto those that work mischief.103  And they indeed carry abouttheir poison in boxes, but yecontain your poison and infectionin your hearts, and will not purgethem, and mix your sense with apure heart, that ye might findmercy with the Great King.104  Take heed, my children,that your dissensions deprive younot of your lives. How will yeinstruct the elect of God, whenye yourselves want correction?Wherefore admonish one another,and be at peace among yourselves,that I, standing before yourFather, may give an accountof you unto the Lord.105  And when she had madean end of talking with me, the sixyoung men that built, came andcarried her to the tower; and fourothers took up the seat on whichshe sat, and they also went awayagain to the tower. I saw not thefaces of these, for their backswere towards me.106  As she was going away, Iasked her, that she would revealto me what concerned the threeforms, in which she had appearedunto me.107  But she answering said untome, concerning these thingsthou must ask some other, thatthey may be revealed unto thee.108  Now, brethren, in the firstvision the last year, she appearedunto me exceedingly old, andsitting in a chair.109  In another vision, she hadindeed a youthful face, but herflesh and hair were old; but shetalked with me standing, and wasmore cheerful than the first time.110  In the third vision, she wasin all respects much younger, andcomely to the eye; only she hadthe hair of an aged person: yetshe looked cheerful, and sat upona seat.111  I was therefore very sadconcerning these things, until Imight understand the vision.112  Wherefore I saw the sameold woman in a vision of the nightsaying unto me, All prayer needethhumiliation. Fast, therefore, andthou shalt learn from the Lordthat which thou dost ask. I fastedtherefore one day.113  The same night a youngman appeared to me and said,Why dost thou thus often desireRevelations in thy prayers? Takeheed that by asking many things,thou hurt not the body. Let theseRevelations suffice thee.114  Canst thou see more notableRevelations than those whichthou hast already received?115  I answered and said untohim, Sir, I only ask this onething upon the account of thethree figures of the old womanthat appeared to me, that theRevelation may be complete.116  He answered me, You arenot without understanding, butyour doubts make you so; for asmuch as you have not your heartwith the Lord.117  I replied and said, But weshall learn these things morecarefully from you.118  Hear then, says he, concerningthe figures about which you inquire.119  To begin; in the first visionshe appeared to thee in the shapeof an old woman sitting in, a chair,because your old spirit was decayed,and without strength, by reasonof your infirmities, and thedoubtfulness of your heart.120  For as they who are oldhave no hope of renewingthemselves, nor expect any thingbut their departure; so you beingweakened through your worldlyaffairs gave yourself up to sloth,and cast not away your solicitudefrom yourself upon the Lord: andyour sense was confused, and yougrew old in your sadness.121  But, sir, I would know whyshe sat upon a chair?122  He answered, because everyone that is weak sitteth upon achair by reason of his infirmity,that his weakness may be upheld.Behold therefore the figure of thefirst vision.123  In the second vision yousaw her standing, and having ayouthful face, and more cheerfulthan her former; but her fleshand her hair were ancient. Hear,said he, this parable also.124  When any one grows old,he despairs of himself by reasonof his infirmity and poverty, andexpects nothing but the last day ofhis life.125  But on a sudden an inheritanceis left to him, and he hears of it,and rises: and being becomecheerful, be puts on new strength.And now he no longer sits down,but stands, and is delivered fromhis former sorrow; and sits not,but acts manfully.126  So you, having heard theRevelation which God revealedunto you, because God hadcompassion upon you, and renewedyour spirit, both laid aside yourinfirmities, and strength came toyou, and you grew strong in thefaith; and God, seeing yourstrength, rejoiced.127  For this cause he showedyou the building of the tower,and will show other things unto you,if you shall have peace with allyour heart among each other.128  But in the third vision yousaw her yet younger, fair andcheerful, and of a serenecountenance.129  For, as if some good newscomes to him that is sad, hestraightway forgets his sadness,and regards nothing else but thegood news which he has heard;and for the rest he is comforted,and his spirit is renewed throughthe joy which he has receivedeven so you have been refreshedin your spirit by seeing these goodthings.130  And for that you saw hersitting upon a bench, it denotes astrong position; because a benchhas four feet, and stands strongly.And even the world itself is upheldby the four elements.131  They therefore that repentperfectly, shall be young; andthey that turn from their sinswith their whole heart, shallbe established.132  And now you have theRevelation fully, ask no moreto have any thing fartherrevealed unto you.133  But if any thing is to berevealed, it shall be made manifestunto you.VISION IV.     Of the trial, and tribulation that is about     to come upon men.I SAW a vision brethren, twentydays after the former vision;a representation of the tribulationthat is at hand. I was walking inthe field way.2  Now from the public way tothe place whither I went is aboutten furlongs; it is a way verylittle frequented:3  And as I was walking alone, Ientreated the Lord that he wouldconfirm the Revelations which hehad shown unto me by his HolyChurch.4  And would grant repentanceto all his servants who had beenoffended, that his great andhonourable name might be glorified,and because he thought me worthyto whom he might show his wonders,and, that I might honour him,and give thanks unto him.5  And behold somewhat like avoice answered me; Doubt not,Hermas. Wherefore I began tothink, and say within myself, whyshould I doubt, seeing I am thussettled by the Lord, and have seensuch glorious things?6  I had gone but a little farther,brethren, when behold I saw adust rise up to heaven. I beganto say within myself, is there adrove of cattle coming, that risessuch a dust?7  It was about a furlong off fromme. And behold I saw the dustrise more and more, insomuch thatI began to suspect that there wassomewhat extraordinary in it.8  And the sun shone a little;and behold I saw a great beast, asit were a whale; and fiery locustscame out of his mouth. The heightof the beast was about a hundredfeet, and he had a head like alarge earthen vessel.9  I began to weep, and to prayunto the Lord that he would deliverme from it. Then I called to mindthe word which I had heard;Doubt not, Hermas.10  Wherefore, brethren, puttingon a divine faith, and rememberingwho it was that had taught me greatthings, I delivered myself bodilyunto the beast.11  Now the beast came on insuch a manner, as if it could atonce have devoured a city.12  I came near unto it, and thebeast extended its whole bulk uponthe ground, and put forth nothingbut its tongue, nor once moved itselftill I had quite passed by it.13  Now the beast had upon itshead four colours; first black,then a red and bloody colour, thena golden, and then a white.14  After that I had passed byit, and was gone forward aboutthirty feet, behold there met me acertain virgin, well adorned as ifshe had been just come out of herbride-chamber; all in white, havingon white shoes, and a veil down herface, and covered with shining hair.15  Now I knew by my formervisions that it was the church,and thereupon grew the more cheerful.She saluted me, saying, Hail, O Man!I returned the salutation, saying,Lady, Hail!16  She answering said unto me,Did nothing meet you, O man!I replied, Lady, there met me sucha beast, as seemed able to devoura whole people; but by the powerof God, and through his singularmercy, I escaped it.17  Thou didst escape it well,said she, because thou didst castthy whole care upon God, andopened thy heart unto him,believing that thou couldst be safeby no other than by his great andhonourable name.18  For this cause the Lord senthis angel, who is over the beast,whose name is Hegrin, and stoppedhis mouth, that he should notdevour thee, Thou hast escapeda great trial through thy faith, andbecause thou didst not doubt forsuch a terrible beast.19  Go, therefore, and relate tothe elect of God the great thingsthat he hath done for thee. Andthou shalt say unto them, that thisbeast is the figure of the trial thatis about to come.20  If, therefore, ye shall haveprepared yourselves, ye may escapeit, if your hearts be pure andwithout spot; and if ye shall serveGod all the rest of your dayswithout complaint.21  Cast all your care upon theLord, and he will direct them.Believe in God, ye doubtful,because he can do all things;he can both turn away his wrathfrom you, and send you help andsecurity.22  Woe to the doubtful, to thosewho shall hear these words, andshall despise them: it had beenbetter for them that they had notbeen born.23  Then I asked her concerningthe four colours which the beasthad upon its head. But sheanswered me saying; Again thouart curious in that thou askethconcerning these things. But Isaid to her, Lady, chew me whatthey are?24  Hear, said she; The blackwhich thou sawest denotes theworld in which you dwell. Thefiery and bloody colour signifiesthat this age must be destroyedby fire and blood.25  The golden part are ye, whohave escaped out of it; for as goldis tried by the fire, and is madeprofitable, so are ye also in likemanner tried who dwell among themen of this world.26  They therefore, that shallendure to the end, and be provedby them, shall be purged. And asgold, by this trial, is cleansedand loses its dross, so shall yealso cast away all sorrow andtrouble, and be made pure forthe building of the tower.27  But the white colour denotesthe time of the world which is tocome, in which the elect of Godshall dwell: because the elect ofGod shall be pure and withoutspot until life eternal.28  Wherefore do not thou ceaseto speak these thing in the ears ofthe saints. Here ye have the figureof the great tribulation that isabout to come; which, if youplease, shall be nothing to you.29  When she had spoken thusmuch, she departed; but I sawnot whither she went. But suddenlyI heard a noise, and I turnedback, being afraid, for I thoughtthat the beast was coming towardme.                         THE SECOND PART OF THE                  BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS COMMANDS.Introduction.WHEN I had prayed at home,and was sat down upon thebed, a certain man came in to mewith a reverend look, in the habitof a Shepherd, clothed with a whitecloak, having his bag upon hisback, and his staff in his hand, andsaluted me.2  I returned his salutation, andimmediately he sat down by me,and said unto me, I am sent bythat venerable messenger, thatI should dwell with thee all theremaining days of thy life.3  But I thought that he wascome to try me, and said unto him,Who are you? For I know towhom I am committed. He saidunto me, Do you not know me?I answered no. I am, said he,that shepherd to whose care youare delivered.4  Whilst he was yet speaking,his shape was changed; and whenI knew that it was he to whom Iwas committed, I was ashamed,and a sudden fear came upon me,and I was utterly overcome withsadness, because I had spoken sofoolishly unto him.5  But he said unto me, Be notashamed, but receive strength inthy mind, through the commandswhich I am about to deliver untothee. For, said he, I am sent toshow unto thee all those thingsagain, which thou hast seen before,but especially such of them as maybe of most use unto thee.6  And first of all write myCommands and Similitudes, the restthou shall so write as I shall showunto thee. But I therefore bidthee first of all write my Commandsand Similitudes, that by oftenreading of them thou mayestthe more easily keep them inmemory.7  Whereupon I wrote his Commandsand Similitudes, as he bade me.8  Which things if when youhave heard, ye shall observe to dothem, and shall walk according tothem, and exercise yourselves inthem with a pure mind, ye shallreceive from the Lord those thingswhich he has promised unto you.9  But if having heard them yeshall not repent, but shall still goon to add to your sins, ye shallbe punished by him.10  All these things that Shepherd,the angel of repentance, commandedme to write.COMMAND I.     Of believing in one God.FIRST of all believe thatthere is one God who created andbrought all things out of nothinginto existence.2  He comprehends all things,and is only INFINITE, not to becomprehended by any.3  Who can neither be definedby any words, nor conceived bythe mind.4  Therefore believe in him, andfear him; and fearing him abstainfrom all evil.5  Keep these things, and castall lust and iniquity far fromthee, and put on righteousness,and thou shalt live to God, if thoushalt keep his commandment.COMMAND II.     That we must avoid detraction, and do our     alms-deeds with simplicity.HE said unto me, Be innocentand without disguise; so shaltthou be like an infant who knowsno malice which destroys thelife of man.2  Especially see that thou speakevil of none, nor willingly hearany one speak evil of others.3  For if thou observest not this,thou also who hearest shall bepartaker of the sin of him thatspeaketh evil, by believing theslander, and thou also shalt havesin, because thou believedst himthat spoke evil of thy brother.4  Detraction is a perniciousthing; an inconstant, evil spirit;that never continues in peace, butis always in discord. Whereforerefrain thyself from it, and keeppeace ever more with thy brother.5  Put on an holy constancy,in which there are no sins, butall is full of joy; and do goodof thy labours.6  Give without distinction toall that are in want, not doubtingto whom thou givest.7  But give to all, for God willhave us give to all, of all his owngifts. They therefore that receiveshall give an account to God, bothwherefore they received and forwhat end.8  And they that receive withoutreal need, shall give an accountfor it; but he that gives shall beinnocent.9  For he has fulfilled his dutyas he received it from God; notmaking any choice to whom heshould give, and to whom not.And this service he did withsimplicity and to the gloryof God.10 Keep therefore this commandaccording as I have delivered itinto thee: that thy repentancenay be found to be sincere, andthat good may come to thy house;and have a pure heart.COMMAND III.     Of avoiding lying, and the repentance of Hermas     for his dissimulation.MOREOVER he said unto melove truth; and let all thespeech be true which proceeds outof thy mouth.2  That the spirit which the Lordhath given to dwell in thy fleshmay be found true towards allmen; and the Lord be glorified,who hath given such a spirit untothee: because God is true in allhis words, and in him there is nolie.3  They therefore that lie, denythe Lord, and become robbers ofthe Lord, not rendering to Godwhat they received from him.4  For they received the spiritfree from lying: If therefore theymake that a liar, they defile whatwas committed to them by theLord, and become deceivers.5  When I heard this, I weptbitterly; and when he saw meweeping, he said unto me, Whyweepest thou? And I said, Because,sir, I doubt whether I can be saved.6  He asked me, Wherefore?I replied, Because, sir, I neverspake a true word in my life; butalways lived in dissimulation, andaffirmed a lie for truth to all men;and no man contradicted me, butall gave credit to my words. Howthen can I live, seeing I have donein this manner?7  And he said unto me, Thouthinkest well and truly; for thououghtest, as the servant of God,to have walked in the truth, andnot have joined an evil consciencewith the spirit of truth, nor havegrieved the holy and true Spiritof God.8  And I replied unto him,Sir, I never before hearkenedso diligently to these things.He answered, Now thou hearest themTake care from henceforth, thateven those things which thou hastformerly spoken falsely for thesake of thy business, may, bythy present truth receive pardon.9  For even those things maybe forgiven, if for the time to comethou shalt speak the truth; andby so doing thou mayest attainunto life.10  And whosoever shall hearkenunto this command, and do it,and shall depart from all lying,he shall live unto God.COMMAND IV.     Of putting away one's wife for adultery.FURTHERMORE, said he, Icommand thee, that thou keepthyself chaste; and that thousuffer not any thought of anyother marriage, or of fornication,to enter into thy heart; for sucha thought produces great sin.2  But be thou at all times mindfulof the Lord, and thou shalt neversin. For if such an evil thoughtshould arise in thy heart, thenthou shall be guilty of a greatsin; and they who do such things,follow the way of death.3  Look therefore to thyself, andkeep thyself from such a thought;for where chastity remains in theheart of a righteous man, there anevil thought ought never to arise.4  And I said unto him, Sir,suffer me to speak a little to you.He bade me say on. And I answered,Sir, if a man that is faithfulin the Lord shall have a wife,and shall catch her in adultery;doth a man sin that continues tolive still with her?5  And he said unto me, As longas he is ignorant of her sin, hecommits no fault in living withher; but if a man shall know hiswife to, have offended, and sheshall not repent of her sin, but goon still in her fornication, and aman shall continue neverthelessto live with her, he shall becomeguilty of her sin, and partake withher in her adultery.6  And I said unto him, Whattherefore is to be done, if thewoman continues on in her sin?He answered, Let her husband puther away, and let him continueby himself; but if he shall putaway his wife and marry another,he also doth commit adultery.7  And I said, What, if thewoman that is so put away, shouldrepent, and be willing to returnto her husband, shall she not bereceived by him? He said unto me,Yes; and if her husband shallnot receive her, he will sin, andcommit a great offence againsthimself; for he ought to receivethe offender, if she repents: onlynot often.8  For, to the servants of God,there is but one repentance; andfor this cause a man that puttethaway his wife ought not to takeanother, because she may repent.9  This act is alike both in theman and in the woman. Now theycommit adultery, not only whopollute their flesh, but whoalso make an image. If thereforea woman perseveres in any thingof this kind, and repents not,depart from her; and live not withher, otherwise thou also shalt bepartaker of her sin.10  But it is therefore commandedthat both the man and the womanshould remain unmarried, becausesuch persons may repent.11  Nor do I in this administerany occasion for the doing of thesethings; but rather that whoso hasoffended, should not offend anymore.12  But for their former sins,God who has the power of healingwill give a remedy; for he hasthe power of all things.13  I asked him again, andsaid, Seeing the Lord hath thoughtme worthy that thou shouldestdwell with me continually, speaka few words unto me, because Iunderstand nothing, and my heartis hardened through my formerconversation; and open myunderstanding because I am verydull, and apprehend nothing at all.14  And he answering saidunto me, I am the minister ofrepentance, and give understandingto all that repent. Does it notseem to thee to be a very wisething to repent? Because he thatdoes so gets great understanding.15  For he is sensible that hehath sinned and done wickedly inthe sight of the Lord, and heremembers within himself that hehas offended, and repents and doesno more wickedly, but does thatwhich is good, and humbles hissoul and afflicts it, because he hasoffended. You see therefore thatrepentance is great wisdom.16  And I said unto him, For thiscause, sir, I inquire diligentlyinto all things, because I am asinner, that I may know what Imust do that I may live; becausemy sins are many.17  And he said unto me, Thoushalt live if thou shalt keep thesemy commandments. And whosoevershall hear and do these commandsshall live unto God.18  And I said unto him, I haveeven now heard from certainteachers, that there is no otherrepentance beside that of baptism,when we go down into the water,and receive the forgiveness of oursins; and that after that, we mustsin no more, but live in purity.19  And he said unto me, Thouhast been rightly informed. Never-the-less seeing now thou inquirestdiligently into all things, I willmanifest this also unto thee; yetnot so as to give any occasion ofsinning, either to those who shallhereafter believe, or to thosewho have already believed in theLord.20  For neither they who havenewly believed, or shall hereafterbelieve, have any repentance of sins,but forgiveness of them.21  But as to those who havebeen called to the faith, and sincethat are fallen into any gross sin,the Lord hath appointed repentance,because God knoweth the thoughtsof all men's hearts, and theirinfirmities, and the manifoldwickedness of the devil, who isalways contriving somethingagainst the servants of God, andmaliciously lays snares for them.22  Therefore our merciful Lordhad compassion towards his creature,and appointed that repentance, andgave unto me the power of it. Andtherefore I say unto thee, if anyone after that great and holycalling shall be tempted by thedevil and sin, he has one repentance.But if he shall often sin and repent,it shall not profit such a one;for he shall hardly live unto God.23  And I said, Sir, I am restoredagain to life since I have thusdiligently hearkened to thesecommands. For I perceive that if Ishall not hereafter add any moreof my sins, I shall be saved.24  And he said, Thou shalt besaved: and so shall all others, asmany as shall observe thesecommandments.25 And again I said unto him,Sir, seeing thou hearest mepatiently, show me yet one thingmore. Tell me, saith he, what itis.26  And I said, If a husband ora wife die, and the party whichsurvives marry again, does he sinin so doing? He that marriessays he, sins not: howbeit, ifhe shall remain single, he shallthereby gain to himself greathonour before the Lord.27  Keep therefore thy chastityand modesty, and thou shalt liveunto God. Observe from henceforththose things which I speakwith thee, and command thee toobserve, from the time that Ihave been delivered unto thee, anddwell in thy house.28  So shall thy former sins beforgiven, if thou shalt keep thesemy commandments. And in likemanner shall all others be forgiven,who shall observe these my commandments.COMMAND V.     Of the sadness of the heart, and of patience.Be patient, says he, and long-suffering; so shalt thou havedominion over all wicked works,and shall fulfil all righteousness.2  For if thou shalt be patient,the Holy Spirit which dwelleth inthee shall be pure, and not bedarkened by any evil spirit; butbeing full of joy shall be enlarged,and feast in the body in which itdwells, and serve the Lord withjoy, and in great peace.3  But if any anger shall overtakethee, presently the Holy Spiritwhich is in thee will be straightenedand seek to depart from thee.4  For he is choked by the evilspirit, and has not the liberty ofserving the Lord as he would; forhe is grieved by anger. When,therefore, both these spirits dwelltogether, it is destructive to aman.5  As if one should take a littlewormwood, and put it into a vesselof honey, the whole honey wouldbe spoiled; and a great quantityof honey is corrupted by a verylittle wormwood, and loses thesweetness of honey, and is nolonger acceptable to its Lordbecause the whole honey is madebitter, and loses its use.6  But if no wormwood be putinto the honey, it is sweet andprofitable to its Lord. Thus isforbearance sweeter than honey,and profitable to the Lord whodwelleth in it.7  But anger is unprofitable.If therefore anger shall be mixedwith forbearance, the soul isdistressed, and its prayer isnot profitable with God.8  And I said unto him, Sir,I would know the sinfulness ofanger, that I may keep myself fromit. And he said unto me, Thoushall know it; and if thou shaltnot keep thyself from it, thou shaltlose thy hope with all thy house.Wherefore depart from it.9  For I the messenger ofrighteousness am with thee, andall that depart from it: as manyas shall repent with all their hearts,shall live unto God; and I will be withthem, and will keep them all.10  For all such as have repentedhave been justified by the mostholy messenger, who is a ministerof salvation.11  And now, says he, hearthe wickedness of anger; howevil and hurtful is is, and how itoverthrows the servants of God;for it cannot hurt those that arefull of faith because the powerof God is with them; but itoverthrows the doubtful, and thosethat are destitute of faith.12  For as often as it sees suchmen, it casts itself into theirhearts; and so a man or womanis in bitterness for nothing: forthe things of life, or for sustenance,or for a vain word, if any shouldchance to fall in; or by reasonof any friend, or for a debt,or for any other superfluousthings of the like nature.13  For these things are foolish,and superfluous, and vain to theservants of God. But equanimityis strong, and forcible; and ofgreat power, and sitteth in greatenlargement; is cheerful, rejoicingin peace; and glorifying God atall times I with meekness.14  And this long-sufferingdwells with those that are full offaith. But anger is foolish, andlight, and empty. Now bitternessis bred through folly; bybitterness, anger; by anger, fury;and this fury arising from somany evil principles, worketh agreat and incurable sin.15  For when all these things,are in the same man in which theHoly Spirit dwells, the vesselcannot contain them, but runsover: and because the Spirit beingtender cannot tarry with the evilone; it departs and dwells withhim that is meek.16  When, therefore, it isdeparted from the man in whom itdwelt, that man becomes destituteof the Holy Spirit, and is afterwardsfilled with wicked spirits, andis blinded with evil thoughts.Thus doth it happen to all angrymen.17  Wherefore depart then fromanger, and put on equanimity, andresist: wrath; so then shalt befound with modesty and chastityby God. Take good heed, therefore,that thou neglect not this commandment.18. For if thou shalt obey thiscommand, then thou shalt also beable to observe the other commandmentswhich I shall command thee.19  Wherefore strengthen thyselfnow in these commands, that thenmayest live unto God. And whosoevershall observe these commandmentsshall live unto God.COMMAND VI.     That every man has two angels and of the     suggestions of both.I COMMANDED thee, said he,in my first commandments,that thou shouldst keep faith andfear, and repentance. Yes, sir,said I.2  He continued. But now Iwill shew thee the virtues of thesecommands, that then mayest knowtheir effects; how they areprescribed alike to the justand unjust.3  Do thou therefore believe therighteous, but give no credit tothe unrighteous. For righteousnesskeepeth the right way, butunrighteousness the wicked way.4  Do thou therefore keep theright way, and leave that which isevil. For the evil way has not agood end, but hath many stumbling-blocks; it is rugged and fullof thorns, and leads to destruction;and it is hurtful to all suchas walk in it.5  But they who go in the rightway walk with evenness, and withoutoffence; because it is not roughnor thorny.6  Thou seest therefore how it isbest to walk in this way. Thoushalt therefore go, says he, and allothers, as many as believe in Godwith all their heart, shall gothrough it.7  And now, says he, I understandfirst of all what belongs to faith.There are two angels with man;one of righteousness, the otherof iniquity.8  And I said unto him, Sir,how shall I know that there aretwo such angels with man? Hear,says he, and understand.9  The angel of righteousness,is mild and modest, and gentle,and quiet. When, therefore, hegets into thy heart, immediatelyhe talks with thee of righteousness,of modesty, of chastity, ofbountifulness, of forgiveness,of charity, and piety.10  When all these things comeinto thy heart, know then that theangel of righteousness is with thee.Wherefore hearken to this angeland to his works.11  Learn also the works of theangel of iniquity. He is first ofall bitter, and angry, and foolish;and his works are pernicious, andoverthrow the servants of God.When therefore these things comeinto thine heart; thou shalt knowby his works, that this is the angelof iniquity.12  And I said unto him, Sir,how shall I understand thesethings? Hear, says he, andunderstand; When anger overtakesthee, or bitterness, know that he isin thee:13  As also, when the desire ofmany things, and of the best meats,and of drunkenness; when thelove of what belongs to others,pride, and much speaking, andambition; and the like things,come upon thee.14  When therefore these thingsarise in thine heart, know that theangel of iniquity is with thee.Seeing therefore thou knowest hisworks, depart from them all, andgive no credit to him: because hisworks are evil, and become not theservants of God.15  Here therefore thou hastthe works of both these angels.Understand now and believe theangel of righteousness, becausehis instruction is good.16  For let a man be never sohappy; yet if the thoughts of theother angel arise in his heart, thatman or woman must needs sin.17  But let man or woman benever so wicked, if the works ofthe angel of righteousness comeinto their hearts, that man orwoman must needs do some good.18  Thou seest therefore howit is good to follow the angel ofrighteousness. If therefore thoushall follow him, and submit tohis works, thou shalt live unto God.And as many as shall submit tohis work shall live also unto God.COMMAND VII.     That we must fear God but not the Devil.FEAR God, says he, and keephis commandments. For ifthou keepest his commandmentsthou shalt be powerful in everywork, and all thy works shall beexcellent. For by fearing God,thou shalt do everything well.2  This is that tear with whichthou must be affected that thoumayest be saved. But fear notthe Devil: for if thou fearest theLord, thou shalt have dominionover him; because there is nopower in him.3  Now if there be no power inhim, then neither is he to befeared: for every one that haspower, is to be feared. But hethat has no power is despised byevery one.4  Fear the works of the Devil,because they are evil. For byfearing the Lord, thou wilt fearand do not the works of the Devil,but keep thyself from them.5  There is therefore a twofoldfear; if thou wilt not do evil, fearthe Lord and thou shalt not do it.But if thou wilt do good, the fearof the Lord is strong, and greatand glorious.6  Wherefore, fear God and thoushalt live: and whosoever shallfear him, and keep his commandments,their life is with the Lord.But they who keep them not,neither is there life in them.COMMAND VIII.     That we must flee from evil, and do good works.I HAVE told thee, said he,that there are two kinds ofcreatures of the Lord, and thatthere is a two-fold abstinence.From some things therefore thoumust abstain, and from others not.2  I answered, Declare to me,sir, from what I must abstain, andfrom what not. Hearken, said he,Keep thyself from evil, and do itnot; yet abstain not from good,but do it. For if thou shalt abstainfrom what is good, and not do it,thou shalt sin. Abstain thereforefrom all evil, and thou shalt knowall righteousness.3  I said, What evil things arethey from which I must abstain?Hearken, said he; from adultery,from drunkenness, from riots, fromexcess of eating, from daintinessand dishonesty, from pride, fromfraud, from lying, from detraction,from hypocrisy, from remembranceof injuries, and from all evilspeaking.4  For these are the works ofiniquity, from which the servantof God must abstain. For he thatcannot keep himself from thesethings, cannot live unto God.5  But hear, said he, whatfollows of these kind of things:for indeed many more there arefrom which the servant of God mustabstain. From theft, and cheating;from false witness, from covetousness,from boasting, and all other thingsof the like nature.6  Do these things seem to theeto be evil or not? Indeed theyare very evil to the servants ofGod, Wherefore the servant ofGod must abstain from all theseworks.7  Keep thyself therefore fromthem, that thou mayest live untoGod, and be written among thosethat abstain from them. And thushave I shown thee what thingsthou must avoid: now learn fromwhat thou must not abstain.8  Abstain not from any goodworks, but do them. Hear, saidhe, what the virtue of those goodworks is which thou must do, thatthou mayest be saved. The firstof all is faith; the fear of theLord; charity; concord; equity;truth; patience; chastity.9  There is nothing better thanthese things in the life of men;who shall keep and do thesethings in their life. Hear nextwhat follow these.10  To minister to the widows;not to despise the fatherless andpoor; to redeem the servants ofGod from necessity; to be hospitable(for in hospitality there issometimes great fruit); not to becontentious, but be quiet.11  To be humble above all men;to reverence the aged; to labourto be righteous; to respect thebrotherhood; to bear affronts; tobe long-suffering; not to castaway those that have fallen fromthe faith, but to convert them, andmake them be of good cheer: toadmonish sinners; not to oppressthose that are our debtors; and allother things of a like kind.12  Do these things seem to theeto be good or not? And I said,What can be better than thesewords? Live then, said he, inthese commandments, and do notdepart from them. For if thoushalt keep all these commandments,thou shalt live unto God. And allthey that shall keep thesecommandments shall live unto God.COMMAND IX.     That we must ask of God daily;     and without doubting.AGAIN he said unto me; remove fromthee all doubting; and questionnothing at all when thou askestany thing of the Lord; sayingwithin thyself, how shall Ibe able to ask any thing of theLord and receive it, seeing I haveso greatly sinned against him?2  Do not think thus, but turnunto the Lord with all thy heart,and ask of him without doubting,and thou shalt know the mercy ofthe Lord; bow that he will notforsake thee, but will fulfil therequest of thy soul.3  For God is not as men, mindfulof the injuries he has received;but he forgets injuries, and hascompassion upon his creature.4  Wherefore purify thy heartfrom all the vices of this presentworld; and observe the commandsI have before delivered unto theefrom God; and thon shall receivewhatsoever good things thou shaltask, and nothing shall be wantingunto thee of all thy petitions; ifthou shalt ask of the Lord withoutdoubting.5  But they that are not such,shall obtain none of those thingswhich they ask. For they that arefull of faith, ask all things withconfidence, and receive from theLord, because they ask withoutdoubting. But he that doubts,shall hardly live unto God, excepthe repent.6  Wherefore purify thy heartfrom doubting, and put on faith,and trust in God, and thou shallreceive all that thou shalt ask.But if thou shouldest chance toask something, and not immediatelyreceive it, yet do not thereforedoubt, because thou hast notpresently received the petitionof thy soul.7  For it may be thou shalt notpresently receive it for thy trial,or else for some sin which thouknowest not. But do not thouleave off to ask, and then thoushalt receive. Else if thou shaltcease to ask, thou must complainof thyself, and not of God, that hehas not given unto thee what thoudidst desire.8  Consider therefore this doubtinghow cruel and pernicious it is;and how it utterly roots out manyfrom the faith, who were veryfaithful and firm. For this doubtingis the daughter of the Devil, anddeals very wickedly with theservants of God.9  Despise it therefore, and thoushalt rule over it on every occasion.Put on a firm and powerful faith:for faith promises all thingsand perfects all things. Butdoubting will not believe that itshall obtain any thing by all thatit can do.10.  Thou seest therefore, sayshe, how faith cometh from abovefrom God; and hath great power.But doubting is an earthly spirit,and proceedeth from the Devil,and has no strength.11  Do thou therefore keep thevirtue of faith, and depart fromdoubting, in which is no virtue,and thou shalt live unto God. Andall shall live unto God, as manyas do these things.COMMAND X.     Of the sadness of the heart; and that     we must take, heed not to grieve the     spirit of God that is in us.PUT all sadness far from thee;for it is the sister of doubtingand of anger.  How, sir, said Iis it the sister of these? Forsadness, and anger, and doubting,seem to me to be very differentfrom one another.2  And he answered: Art thouwithout sense that thou dost notunderstand it? For sadness is themost mischievous of all spirits,and the worst to the servants ofGod: It destroys the spirits of allmen, and torments the Holy Spirit,and it saves again.3  Sir, said I, I am very foolish,and understand not these things.I cannot apprehend how it cantorment, and yet save. Hear, saidhe, and understand. They whonever sought out the truth, norinquired concerning the majestyof God, but only believed, areinvolved in the affairs of theheathen.4  And there is another lyingprophet that destroys the mindsof the servants of God; that isof those that are doubtful, not ofthose that fully trust in the Lord.Now those doubtful persons cometo him, as to a divine spirit, andinquire of him what shall befallthem.5  And this lying prophet, havingno power in him of the DivineSpirit, answers them according totheir demands, and fills their soulswith promises according as theydesire. Howbeit that prophet isvain, and answers vain things tothose who are themselves vain.6  And whatsoever is asked ofhim by vain men, he answers themvainly; nevertheless he speakethsome things truly. For the Devilfills him with his spirit, that hemay overthrow some of therighteous.7  Whosoever therefore arestrong in the faith of the Lord,and have put on the truth; theyare not joined to such spirits, butdepart from them. But they thatare doubtful, and often repenting,like the heathens, consult them,and heap up to themselves greatsin, serving idols.8  As many therefore as aresuch, inquire of them upon everyoccasion; worship idols, and arefoolish; and void of the truth.For every spirit that is givenfrom God needs not to be asked:but having the power of divinityspeaks all things of itself,because he comes from above;from the power of God.10  But he, that being askedspeaks according to men's desiresand concerning many other affairsof this present world, understandsnot the tidings which relate untoGod. For these spirits are darkenedthrough such affairs, and corrupted,and broken.11  As good vines if they areneglected, are oppressed with weedsand thorns, and at last killed bythem; so are the men who believesuch spirits.12  They fall into many actionsand businesses, and are void ofsense, and when they think ofthings pertaining unto God, theyunderstand nothing at all; butat any time they chance to hearany thing concerning the Lord,their thoughts are upon theirbusiness.13  But they that have the fearof the Lord, and search out thetruth concerning God, having alltheir thoughts towards the Lord;apprehend whatsoever is said tothem, and forthwith understandit, because they have the fearof the Lord in them.14  For where the spirit of theLord dwells, there is also muchunderstanding added. Whereforejoin thyself to the Lord, and thoushalt understand all things.15  Learn now, O unwise man!how sadness troubleth the HolySpirit, and how it saves. Whena man that is doubtful is engagedin any affair, and does notaccomplish it by reason of hisdoubting; this sadness entersinto him, and grieves the HolySpirit, and makes him sad.16  Again anger, when it over.takes any man for any business heis greatly moved; and then againsadness entereth into the heart ofhim, who was moved with anger,and he is troubled for what he hathdone, and repenteth, because hehath done amiss.17  This sadness therefore seemethto bring salvation, because herepenteth of his evil deed. Butboth the other things, namely,doubting and sadness, such asbefore was mentioned, vex thespirit: doubting, because hiswork did not succeed; and sadness,because he angered the Holy Spirit.18  Remove therefore sadnessfrom thyself, and afflict not theHoly Spirit which dwelleth inthee, lest he entreat God, anddepart from thee. For the spiritof the Lord which is given todwell in the flesh, endureth nosuch sadness.19  Wherefore clothe thyselfwith cheerfulness, which has alwaysfavour with the Lord, and thou shaltrejoice in it. For every cheerfulman does well; and relishes thosethings that are good, and despisessadness.20  But the sad man does alwayswickedly. First, he doth wickedly,because he grieveth the Holy Spirit,which is given to man being of acheerful nature. And again he doesill, because be prays with sadnessunto the Lord, and maketh not firsta thankful acknowledgment unto himof former mercies, and obtains notof God what he asks.21  For the prayer of a sad manhas not always efficacy to come upto the altar of God. And I saidunto him, Sir, why has not theprayer of a sad man virtue to comeup to the altar of God?  Because,said he, that sadness remaineth inhis heart.22  When therefore a man'sprayer shall be accompanied withsadness, it will not suffer hisrequests to ascend pure to the altarof God. For as wine when it ismingled with vinegar, has not thesweetness it had before; so sadnessbeing mixed with the Holy Spirit,suffers not a man's prayer to bethe same as it would be otherwise.23  Wherefore cleanse thyselffrom sadness, which is evil, andthou shalt live unto God. And allothers shall live unto God, as manyas shall lay aside sadness, and puton cheerfulness.COMMAND XI.     That the spirits and prophets are to be     tried by their works; and of a twofold, spirit.HE showed me certain mensitting upon benches, andone sitting in a chair: and he saidunto me; Seest thou those who situpon the benches? Sir, said I,I see them. He answered, Theyare the faithful; and he who sitsin the chair is an earthly spirit.2  For he cometh not into theassembly of the faitful, but avoidsit. But he joins himself to thedoubtful and empty; and prophesiesto them in corners and hidden places;and pleases them by speaking accordingto all the desires of their hearts.3 For he placing himself amongempty vessels, is not broken, butthe one fitteth the other. Butwhen he cometh into the companyof just men, who are full of thespirit of God, and they pray untothe Lord; that man is emptied,because that earthly spirit fliesfrom him, and he is dumb, andcannot speak anything.4  As if in a store-house youshall stop up wine or oil, andamong those vessels place anempty jar; and when afterwardsyou come to open it, you shallfind it empty as you stopped it up;so those empty prophets whenthey come among the spirits ofthe just, are found to be such asthey came.5  I said, How then shall aman be able to discern them?Consider what I am going to sayconcerning both kinds of men;and as I speak unto thee so shaltthou prove the prophet of God,and the false prophet.6  And first try the man whohath the spirit of God, becausethe spirit which is from above ishumble, and quiet, and departsfrom all wickedness; and from thevain desires of the present world;and makes himself more humblethan all men; and answers to nonewhen he is asked; nor to everyone singly: for the Spirit of Goddoth not speak to a man when hewill, but when God pleases.7  When therefore a man who haththe Spirit of God hath come intothe church of the righteous, whohave the faith of God, and theypray unto the Lord; then the holyangel of God fills that man withthe blessed Spirit, and he speaksin the congregation as he is movedof God.8  Thus therefore is the spirit,of God known, because whosoeverspeaketh by the Spirit of God,speaketh as the Lord will.9  Hear now concerning theearthly spirit, which is empty andfoolish, and without virtue. Andfirst of all the man who is supposedto have the Spirit, (whereas he hathit not in reality), exalteth himself,and desires to have the first seat,and is wicked, and full of words.10  And spends his time in pleasure,and in all manner of voluptuousness,and receives the reward of hisdivination; which if he receivesnot, he does not divine.11  Should the Spirit of Godreceive reward, and divine? It dothnot become a prophet of God so todo.12  Thus you seethe life of eachof these kind of prophets. Whereforeprove that man by his life and works,who says that he hath the Holy Spirit.And believe the Spirit which comesfrom God, and has power as such.But believe not the earthly andempty spirit, which is from thedevil, in whom there is no faithnor virtue.13  Hear now the similitudewhich I am about to speak untothee. Take a stone, and throw itup towards heaven; or take aspout of water, and mount it upthitherward; and see if thoucanst reach unto heaven.14  Sir; said I, how can this bedone? For neither of those thingswhich you have mentioned, arepossible to be done. And heanswered, Therefore as these thingscannot be done, so is the earthyspirit without virtue, and withouteffect.15  Understand yet farther thepower which cometh from above,in this similitude. The grains ofhail that drop down are exceedinglysmall; and yet when they fall uponthe head of a man, how do theycause pain to it.16  And again, consider, thedroppings of a house; how thelittle drops falling upon the earth,work a hollow in the stones.17  So in like manner the leastthings which come from above,and fall upon the earth, have greatforce. Wherefore join thyselfto this spirit, which has thepower; and depart from the otherwhich is empty.COMMAND XII.     Of a two fold  desire: that the commands of God,     are not impossible: and that the devil is not     to be feared by them that believe.AGAIN he said unto me;remove from thee all evildesires, and put on good andholy desires. For having put on agood desire, thou shalt hate thatwhich is evil, and bridle it as thouwilt. But an evil desire is dreadful,and hard to be tamed.2  It is very horrible and wild;and by its wildness consumes men.And especially if a servant of Godshall chance to fall into it, excepthe be very wise, he is ruined byit. For it destroys those who havenot the garment of a good desireand are engaged in the affairs ofthis present world; and deliversthem unto death.3  Sir, said I, what are the worksof an evil desire, which bring menunto death? Shew them to me thatI may depart from them. Hear, said he,by what works an evil desire bringeththe servants of God unto death.4  First of all, it is an evil desireto covet another man's wife, orfor a woman to covet another'shusband; as also to desire thedainties of riches; and multitudeof superfluous meats; and drunkenness;and many delights.5  For in much delicacy there isfolly; and many pleasures areneedless to the servants of God.Such lusting therefore is evil andpernicious, which brings to deaththe servants of God. For all suchlusting is from the devil.6 Whosoever therefore shalldepart from all evil desires,shall live unto God; but theythat are subject unto them shalldie forever. For this evil lustingis deadly. Do thou therefore puton the desire of righteousness,and being armed with the fear ofthe Lord resist all wicked lusting.7 For this fear dwelleth in gooddesires; and, when evil covetingshall see thee armed with the fearof the Lord, and resisting it; itwill fly far from thee, and notappear before thee, but be afraidof thy armour.8  And thou shall have the victory,and be crowned for it; and shallattain to that desire which isgood; and shall give the victorywhich thou hast obtained untoGod, and shall serve him in doingwhat thou thyself wouldest do.9  For if thou shalt serve gooddesires, and be subject to them;then thou shalt be able to get thedominion over thy wicked lustings;and they will be subject to thee,as thou wilt.10  And I said, Sir, I wouldknow how to serve that desirewhich is good? Hearken, said he,Fear God, and put thy trust inhim, and love truth, andrighteousness, and do thatwhich is good.10  If thou shalt do these things,thou shall be an approved servantof God, and serve him; and allothers who shall in like mannerserve a good desire, shall live untoGod.12  And when he had fulfilledthese twelve commands, he saidunto me, Thou hast now thesecommands, walk in them; and exhortthose that hear them, to repent,and that they keep theirrepentance pure all theremaining days of their life.13  And fulfil diligently thisministry which I commit to thee,and thou shalt receive greatadvantage by it, and find favourwith all such as shall repentand believe thy words. For I amwith thee, and will force themto believe.14  And I said unto him, Sir,these commands are great andexcellent, and able to cheer theheart of that man that shall beable to keep them. But, Sir,I cannot tell, whether they canbe observed by any man?15  He answered, Thou shalteasily keep these commands, andthey shall not be hard: howbeit,if thou shalt suffer it once toenter into thine heart that theycannot be kept by any one, thoushalt not fulfil them.16  But now I say unto thee,if thou shalt not observe thesecommands, and shall neglect them,thou shalt not be saved, nor thychildren, nor thy house: becausethou hast judged that thesecommands cannot be kept by man.17  These things he spakevery angrily unto me, insomuchthat he greatly affrighted me,for he changed his countenanceso that a man could not bear hisanger.18  And when he saw me altogethertroubled and confounded, he beganto speak more moderately andcheerfully, saying, O foolish,and without understanding!19  Unconstant, not knowingthe majesty of God how great andwonderful he is; who created theworld for man, and hath madeevery creature subject unto him;and given him all power, that heshould be able to fulfil all thesecommands.20  He is able, said he, to fulfilall these commands, who has theLord in his heart; but they whohave the Lord only in their mouths,their hearts are hardened, andthey are far from the Lord: tosuch persons these commands arehard and difficult.21 Therefore, ye that are emptyand light in the faith, put theLord your God in your hearts;and ye shall perceive how thatnothing is more easy than thesecommands, nor more pleasant, normore gentle and holy.22  And turn yourselves to theLord your God, and forsake thedevil and his pleasures, becausethey are evil, and bitter, andimpure. And fear not the devil,because he has no power over you.23  For I am with you, themessenger of repentance, who havethe dominion over him. The devildoth indeed affright men but histerror is vain. Wherefore fearhim not, and he will flee from you.24 And I said unto him; Sir,hear me speak a few words untoyou. He answered, Say on: Aman indeed desires to keep thecommandments of God, and thereis no one but what prays unto God,that he may be able to keep hiscommandments;25  But the devil is hard, andby his power rules over the servantsof God. And he said; He cannotrule over the servants of God,who trust in him with all theirhearts.26  The devil may strive, but hecannot overcome them.27  For if ye resist him, he willflee away with confusion from you.But they that are not full in thefaith, fear the devil, as if he hadsome great power. For the deviltries the servants of God and if hefinds them empty, he destroysthem.28  For as man, when he fills upvessels with good wine, and amongthem puts a few vessels half full,and comes to try and taste of thevessels, doth not try those that arefull, because he knows that theyare good, but tastes those that arehalf full, lest they should growsour; (for vessels half full soongrow sour, and lose the taste ofwine:) so the devil comes to theservants of God to try them.29  They that are full of faithresist him stoutly, and he departsfrom them, because he finds noplace where to enter into themthen he goes to those that are notfull of faith, and because he has aplace of entrance he goes intothem, and does what he will withthem, and they become his servants.30  But I, the messenger ofrepentance, say unto you, fear notthe devil, for I am sent unto you,that I may be with you, as manyas shall repent with your wholeheart, and that I may confirm youin the faith.31  Believe therefore, ye whoby reason of your transgressionshave forgot God. and your ownsalvation; and adding to yoursins have made your life veryheavy.32  That if ye shall turn to theLord with your whole hearts, andshall serve him according to hiswill; he will heal you of yourformer sins, and ye shall havedominion over all the works of thedevil.33  Be not then afraid in theleast of his threatenings, for theyare without force, as the nerves ofa dead man. But hearken untome, and fear the Lord Almighty,who is able to save and to destroyyou; and keep his commands, thatye may live unto God.34  And I said unto him; Sir,I am now confirmed in all thecommands of the Lord whilst youare with me, and I know that youwill break all the powers of thedevil.35  And we also shall overcomehim, if we shall be able, throughthe help of the Lord, to keep thesecommands which you have delivered.36  Thou shalt keep them, saidhe, if thou shalt purify thy hearttowards the Lord. And all theyalso shall keep them who shallcleanse their hearts from the vaindesires of the present world, andshall live unto God.                         THE THIRD PART OF THE                BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS SIMILITUDES.SIMILITUDE I.     That seeing we have no abiding city in this world,     we ought to look after that which is to come.AND he said onto me; Ye knowthat ye who are the servantsof the Lord, live here as ina pilgrimage; for your cityis far off from this city.2  If, therefore, ye know yourcity in which ye are to dwell,why do ye here buy estates, andprovide yourselves with delicacies,and stately buildings, andsupurfluous houses? For he thatprovides himself these thingsin this city, does not thinkof returning into his own city.3 O foolish, and doubtful, andwretched man; who understandestnot that all these things belongto other men, and are under thepower of another. For the Lordof this city saith unto thee;Either obey my laws, or departout of my city.4  What therefore shalt thou dowho art subject to a law in thineown city? Canst thou for thyestate, or for any of those thingswhich thou hast provided, denythy law? But if thou shalt denyit, and wilt afterwards return intothy own city, thou shalt not bereceived, but shall be excludedthence.5  See therefore, that like a manin another country, thou procureno more to thyself than what isnecessary, and sufficient for thee;and be ready, that when the Godor Lord of this city shall drivethee out of it thou mayest opposehis law, and go into thine owncity; where thou mayest with allcheerfulness live according tothine own law with no wrong.6  Take heed therefore ye thatserve God, and have him in yourhearts: work ye the works ofGod, being mindful both of hiscommands and of his promises,which he has promised; and beassured that he will make themgood unto you; if ye shall keephis commandments.7  Instead therefore of thepossessions that ye would otherwisepurchase, redeem those that arein want from their necessities,as every one is able; justify thewidows; judge the cause of thefatherless; and spend your richesand your wealth in such works asthese.8  For this end has God enrichedyou, that ye might fulfil thesekind of services. It is muchbetter to do this, than to buy landsor houses; because all such thingsshall perish with this present time.9  But what ye shall do for thename of the Lord, ye shall findin your city, and shall have joywithout sadness or fear. Whereforecovet not the riches of the heathen;for they are destructive to theservants of God.10  But trade with your own richeswhich you possess, by which ye mayattain unto everlasting joy.11  And do not commit adultery,nor touch any other man's wife,nor desire her; but covet thatwhich is thy own business, andthou shalt be saved.SIMILITUDE II.     As the vine is supported by the elm,     so is the rich man helped by the prayers of the poor.AS I was walking into the field,and considered the elm andthe vine, and thought with myselfof their fruits, an angel appearedunto me, and said unto me; Whatis it that thou thinkest upon thuslong within thyself?2  And I said unto him, Sir, Ithink of this vine and this elmbecause their fruits are fair.And he said unto me; These twotrees are set for a pattern tothe servants of God.3  And I said unto him, Sir, Iwould know in what the patternof these trees which thou mentionest,does consist. Hearken, saith he;seest thou this vine and thiselm? Sir, said I, I see them.4  This vine, saith he, is fruitful,but the elm is a tree without fruit.Nevertheless this vine unless itwere set by this elm, and supportedby it, would not bear muchfruit; but lying along upon theground, would bear but ill fruit,because it did not hang upon theelm; whereas, being supportedupon the elm, it bears fruit bothfor itself and for that.5  See, therefore, how the elmgives no less, but rather morefruit, than the vine. How, Sir,said I, does it bear more fruitthan the vine? Because, said he,the vine being supported uponthe elm gives both much and goodfruit; whereas, if it lay alongupon the ground, it would bearbut little, and that very ill too.6  This similitude, therefore,is set forth to the servants of God;and it represents the rich and poorman. I answered, Sir, make thismanifest unto me.   Hear, said he;the rich man has wealth: howbeittowards the Lord he is poor; forhe is taken up about his riches,and prays but little to the Lord;and the prayers which he makesare lazy and without force.7  When therefore, the rich manreaches out to the poor thosethings which he wants, the poorman prays unto the Lord for therich; and God grants unto therich man all good things, becausethe poor man is rich in prayer;and his requests have great powerwith the Lord.8  Then the rich man ministersall thing to the poor, because heperceives that he is heard by theLord; and he the more willinglyand without doubting, affords himwhat he wants, and takes care thatnothing be lacking to him.9  And the poor man givesthanks unto the Lord for the rich;because they both do their workfrom the Lord.10  With men, therefore, theelm is not thought to give anyfruit; and they know not, neitherunderstand that its company beingadded to the vine, the vine bears adouble increase, both for itself andfor the elm.11  Even so the poor prayingunto the Lord for the rich, areheard by him; and their richesare increased, because they ministerto the poor of their wealth.They are, therefore, both madepartakers of each other's goodworks.12  Whosoever, therefore, shalldo these things, he shall not beforsaken by the Lord, but shall bewritten in the book of life.13  Happy are they who are rich,and perceive themselves to beincreased: for he that is sensibleof this, will be able to ministersomewhat to others.SIMILITUDE III.     As the greet trees in the winter cannot be     distinguished from the dry; so neither can the     righteous from the wicked in this present world.AGAIN he showed me manytrees whose leaves were shed,and which seemed to me to bewithered, for they were all alike.And he said unto me, Seest thouthese trees?   I said, Sir, I see thatthey look like dry trees.2  He answering, said unto me;These trees are like unto the menwho live in the present world. Ireplied: Sir, why are they likeunto dried trees? Because, saidhe, neither the righteous, norunrighteous, are known from oneanother; but all are alike in thispresent world.3  For this world is as the winterto the righteous men, becausethey are not known, but dwellamong sinners.4  As in the winter all the treeshaving lost their leaves, are likedry trees; nor can it be discernedwhich are dry and which are green:so in this present world neitherthe righteous, nor wicked arediscerned from each other; but theyare all alike.SIMILITUDE IV.     As in the summer the living trees are distinguished     from the dry by their fruit and green leaves;     so in the world to come the righteous shall be     distinguished from the unrighteous by their happiness.AGAIN he showed me manyother trees, of which somehad leaves, and others appeareddry and withered. And he saidunto me, Seest thou these treesI answered, Sir, I see them; someare dry, and others full of leaves.2  These trees, saith be, whichare green, are the righteous, whoshall possess the world to come.For the world to come, is the summerto the righteous; but to sinnersit is the winter.3  When, therefore, the mercyof the Lord shall shine forth, thenthey who serve God shall be mademanifest, and plain unto all. Foras in the summer the fruit of everytree is shown and made manifest.so also the works of the righteousshall be declared and made manifest,and they shall all be restoredin that world merry and joyful.4  For the other kind of men,namely the wicked, like the treeswhich thou rawest dry, shall, assuch, be found dry and withoutfruit in that other world; and likedry wood shall be burnt; and itshall be made manifest that theyhave done evil all the time of theirlife;5  And they shall be burnt becausethey have sinned and have notrepented of their sins. Andalso all the other nations shallbe burnt, because they have notacknowledged God their Creator.6  Do then, therefore, bring forthgood fruit, that in the summer thyfruit may be known; and keepthyself from much business, andthou shalt not offend. For theywho are involved in much business,sin much; because they are takenup with their affairs, andserve not God.7  And how can a man that doesnot serve God, ask anything ofGod, and receive it? But theywho serve him, ask and receivewhat they desire.8  But if a man has only onething to follow, he may serve God,because his mind is not taken offfrom God, but he serves him witha pure mind.9  If, therefore, thou shalt dothis, thou mayest have fruit inthe world to come; and as many asshall do in like manner, shallbring forth fruit.SIMILITUDE V.     Of a true fast, and the rewards of it:     also of the cleanliness of the body.AS I was fasting, and sittingdown in a certain mountain,and giving thanks unto God for allthe things that he had done untome; behold, I saw the Shepherd,who was wont to converse withme, sitting by me, and sayingunto me:  What has brought theehither thus early in the morning?I answered, Sir, to-day I keep astation.2  He answered, What is a station;I replied, it is a fast. He said,What is that fast?  I answered,I fast as I have been wont todo. Ye know not, said he, whatit is to fast unto God; nor is thisa fast which ye keep, profitingnothing with God.3  Sir, said I, what makes youspeak thus? He replied, I speakit, because it is not the true fastwhich you think that you keep;but I will show you what that iswhich is a complete fast, andacceptable unto God.4  Hearken, said he, The Lorddoes not desire such a needlessfast; for by fasting in this manner,thou advancest nothing inrighteousness.5  But the true fast is this: Donothing wickedly in thy life, butserve God with a pure mind; andkeep his commandments, and walkaccording to his precepts, norsuffer any wicked desire to enterinto the mind.6  But trust in the Lord, that ifthou dost these things, any fearesthim, and abstaineth from everyevil work, thou shall live untoGod.7  If thou shalt do this, thoushall perfect a great fast, and anacceptable one unto the Lord.8  Hearken unto the similitudewhich I am about to proposeunto thee, as to this matter.9  A certain man having a farm,and many servants, planted a vineyardin a certain part of his estate forhis posterity:10  And taking a journey intoa far country, chose one of hisservants which he thought the mostfaithful and approved, and deliveredthe vineyard into his care;commanding him that he shouldstake up the vines. Which if hedid, and fulfilled his command, hepromised to give him his liberty.Nor did he command him to doany thing more; and so went intoa far country.11  And after that servant hadtaken that charge upon him, hedid whatsoever his lord commandedhim. And when he had staked thevineyard, and found it to be fullof weeds, he began to think withinhimself, saying:12  I have done what my lordcommanded me, I will now digthis vineyard, and when it is digged,it will be more beautiful; and theweeds being pulled up, it willbring forth more fruit and not bechoked by the weeds.13  So setting about this workhe digged it, and plucked up allthe weeds that were in it; and sothe vineyard became very beautifuland prosperous, not being chokedwith weeds.14  After some time the lord ofthe vineyard comes and goes intothe vineyard, and when he sawthat it was handsomely staked anddigged, and the weeds plucked upthat were in it, and the vinesflourishing, he rejoiced greatly atthe care of his servant.15  And calling his son whomhe loved, and who was to be hisheir, and his friends with whomhe was wont to consult; he tellsthem what he had commanded hisservant to do, and what hisservant had done more; and theyimmediately congratulated thatservant, that he had received sofull a testimony from his lord.16  Then he said to them, Iindeed promised this servant hisliberty, if he observed the commandwhich I gave him; and he observed it,and besides has done a good workto my vineyard, which has exceedinglypleased me.17  Wherefore, for this workwhich he hath done, I will makehim my heir together with myson; because that when he sawwhat was good, he neglected itnot, but did it.18  This design of the lord bothhis son and his friends approved,namely, that his servant should beheir together with his son.19  Not long after this the masterof the family calling together, hisfriends, sent from his supper severalkinds of food to that servant.20  Which when he had received,he took so much of them as wassufficient for himself, and dividedthe rest among his fellow-servants.21  Which when they had received,they rejoiced; and wished thathe might find yet greater favourwith his lord, for what he haddone to them.22  When his lord heard all thesethings, he was again filled withgreat joy: and calling again hisfriends and his son together, herelated to them what his servanthad done with the meats which hehad sent unto him.23  They therefore so much themore assented to the master of thehousehold; and he ought to makethat servant his heir together withhis son.24  I said unto him, sir, I knownot these smilitudes, neither canI understand them, unless youexpound them unto me. I will,says he, expound, all things untothee whatsoever I have talked withthee, or shown unto thee.25  Keep the commandments ofthe Lord and thou shalt be approved,and shall be written in the numberof those that keep his commandments.But if besides those things whichthe Lord hath commanded, thou shaltadd some good thing; thou shallpurchase to thyself a greater dignity,and be in more favour with the Lordthan thou shouldst otherwise have been.26  If therefore thou shalt keepthe commandments of the Lord,and shalt add to them these stations,thou shall rejoice; but especiallyif thou shalt keep them accordingto my commands.27  I said unto him, sir, whatsoeverthou shah command me, I will observe;for I know that thou wilt be with me.I will, said he, be with thee who hasttaken up such a resolution; and I willbe with all those who purpose in likemanner.28  This fast, saith he, whilstthou dost also observe thecommandments of the Lord, isexceeding good; therefore thusshalt thou keep it.29  First of all, take heed tothyself, and keep thyself from everywicked act, and from every filthyword, and from every hurtful desire;and purify thy mind from all thevanity of this present world. Ifthou shalt observe these things,this fast shall be right.30  Thus therefore do.   Havingperformed what is before written,that day on which thou fastestthou shalt taste nothing at all butbread and water; and computingthe quantity of food which thouart want to eat upon other days,thou shalt lay aside the expensewhich thou shouldest have madethat day, and give it unto thewidow, the fatherless, and thepoor.31  And thus thou shalt perfectthe humiliation of thy soul; thathe who receives of it may satisfyhis soul, and his prayer come upto the Lord God for thee.32  If therefore thou shalt thusaccomplish thy fast, as I commandthee, thy sacrifice shall beacceptable unto the Lord, and thyfast shall be written in his book.33  This station, thus performed,is good and pleasing and acceptableunto the Lord. These things if thoushalt observe with thy children andwith all thy house, thou shaltbe happy.34  And whosoever, when theyhear these things, shall do them,they also shall be happy; andwhatsoever they shall ask of theLord they shall receive it.35  And I prayed him that hewould expound unto me the similitudeof the farm, and the Lord, and ofthe vineyard, and of the servantthat had staked the vineyard;and of the weeds that wereplucked out of the vineyard; andof his son and his friends whichhe took into counsel with him;for I understand that that wasa similitude.36  He said unto me, Thou artvery bold in asking; for thououghtest not to ask any thing;because if it be fitting to show itunto thee, it shall be showed untothee.37  I answered him; Sir, whatsoeverthou shalt show me, without explainingit unto me, I shall in vain see it,if I do not understand what it is.And if thou shalt propose anysimilitudes, and not expound them,I shall in vain hear them.38  He answered me again, saying:Whosoever is the servant of God,and has the Lord in his heart,he desires understanding of him,and receives it; and he explainsevery similitude, and understandsthe words of the Lord which needan inquiry.39  But they that are lazy andslow to pray, doubt to seek fromthe Lord: although the Lord be ofsuch an extraordinary goodness,that without ceasing he giveth allthings to them that ask of him.40  Thou therefore who artstrengthened by that venerablemessenger, and hast received sucha powerful gift of prayer; seeingthou art not slothful, why dostthou not now ask understanding ofthe Lord, and receive it?41  I said unto him; seeing Ihave thee present, it is necessarythat I should seek it of thee, andask thee; for thou shewest allthings unto me, and speakest tome when thou art present.42  But if I should see or hearthese things when thou wert notpresent, I would then ask the Lordthat he would chew them unto me.43  And he replied, I said alittle before that thou wert subtleand bold, in that thou asketh themeaning of these similitudes.44  But because thou still persistest,I will unfold to thee this parablewhich then desirest, that thou mayestmake it known unto all men.45  Hear, therefore, said he,and understand. The farm beforementioned denotes the whole earth.The Lord of the farm is he, whocreated and finished all things;and gave virtue unto them.46  His son is the Holy Spirit;the servant is the Son of God: thevineyard is the people whom hesaves. The stakes are the messengerswhich are set oven them by the Lord,to support his people. The weedsthat are plucked up out of thevineyard, are the sins whichthe servants of God hadcommitted.47  The food which he sent himfrom his supper, are the commandswhich he gave to his people by hisSon. The friends whom he calledto counsel with him, are the holyangels whom he first created. Theabsence of the master of the household,is the time that remains untohis coming.48  I said unto him, Sir, allthese things are very excellent,and wonderful, and good. But,continued I, could I or any otherman besides, though never so wise,have understood these things?49  Wherefore now, sir, tell me,what I ask. He replied, ask mewhat thou wilt. Why, said I, isthe Son of God in this parable,put in the place of a servant.50  Hearken, he said: the Sonof God is not put in the conditionof a servant, but in great powerand authority. I said unto him,how, sir? I understand it not.51  Because, said he, the Son sethis messengers over those whomthe Father delivered unto him, tokeep every one of them; but hehimself laboured very much, andsuffered much, that he might blotout their offences.52  For no vineyard can be diggedwithout much labour and pains.Wherefore having blotted out thesins of his people, he showed tothem the paths of life, givingthem the law which he hadreceived of the Father.53  You see, said he, that he isthe Lord of his people, havingreceived all power from his Father.But why the lord did take hisson into counsel, about dividingthe inheritance, and the goodangels, hear now.54  That Holy Spirit, which wascreated first of all, he placed in thebody in which God should dwell;namely, in a chosen body, as itseemed good to him. This bodytherefore into which the HolySpirit was brought, served thatSpirit, walking rightly and purelyin modesty; nor ever defiled thatSpirit.55  Seeing therefore the body atall times obeyed the Holy Spirit,and laboured rightly and chastelywith him, nor faltered at anytime;that body being wearied conversedindeed servilely, but beingmightily approved to God withthe Holy Spirit, was accepted byhim.56  For such a stout coursepleased God, because he was notdefiled in the earth, keeping theHoly Spirit. He called thereforeto counsel his Son, and the goodangels, that there might be someplace of standing given to thisbody which had served the HolySpirit without blame; lest itshould seem to have lost thereward of its service.57  For every pure body shallreceive its reward; that is foundwithout spot, in which the HolySpirit has been appointed to dwell.And thus you have now the expositionof this parable also.58  Sir, said I, I now understandyour meaning, since I have heardthis exposition. Hearken farther,said he: keep this thy body cleanand pure, that the Spirit whichshall dwell in it may bear witnessunto it, and be judged to havebeen with thee.59  Also take heed that it be notinstilled into thy mind that thisbody perishes, and thou abuse itto any lust. For if thou shaltdefile thy body, thou shalt also atthe same time defile the HolySpirit; and if thou shalt defilethe Holy Spirit, thou shall notlive.60  And I said, What if throughignorance this should have beenalready committed, before a manheard these words; How can heattain into salvation, who has thusdefiled his body?61  He replied, As for men's formeractions which through ignorancethey have committed, God only canafford a remedy unto them; for allthe power belongeth unto him.62  But now guard thyself; andseeing God is almighty and merciful,he will grant a remedy to what thouhast formerly done amiss, if for thetime, to come thou shalt not defilethy body and spirit:63  For they are companions together,and the one cannot be defiled but theother will be so too. Keep thereforeboth of them pure, and thou shaltlive unto God.SIMILITUDE VI.     Of two sorts of voluptuous men, and of     their death and defection; and of the     continuance of their pains.AS I was sitting at home, andpraising God for all the thingswhich I had seen; and was thinkingconcerning the commands, that theywere exceedingly good, and great,and honest, and pleasant, andsuch as were able to bring a manto salvation; I said thus withinmyself, I shall be happy if I walkaccording to these commands; andwhosoever shall walk in them shalllive unto God.2  Whilst I was speaking on thiswise within myself, I saw himwhom I had before been wont tosee, sitting by me; and he spakethus unto me:3  What doubtest thou concerningmy commands which I have deliveredunto thee? They are good, doubt not,but trust in the Lord, and thou shaltwalk in them; for I will give theestrength to fulfil them.4  These commands are profitableto those who shall repent of thesins which they have formerlycommitted; if for the time to comethey shall not continue in them.5  Whosoever therefore ye bethat repent, cast away from youthe naughtiness of the presentworld; and put on all virtue, andrighteousness, and so shall ye beable to keep these commands;and not sin from henceforth anymore.6  For if ye shall keep yourselvesfrom sin for the time to come,ye shall cut off a great dealof your former sins. Walk in mycommands, and ye shall live untoGod: These things have I spokenunto you.7  And when he, had said this,he added; let us go into the field,and I will show thee shepherds ofsheep. I replied, sir, let us go.8  And we came into a certainfield, and there he showed me ayoung shepherd, finely arrayed,with his garments of a purplecolour. And he fed large flocks;and his sheep were full of pleasure,and in much delight and cheerfulness;and they skipping, ran here and there.9  And the shepherd took verygreat satisfaction in his flock; andthe countenance of that shepherdwas cheerful, running up and downamong his flock.10  Then the angel said untome, Seest then this shepherd?I answered, sir, I see him.He said unto me, this is themessenger of delight and pleasure.He therefore corrupts the mindsof the servants of God, and turnsthem from the truth, delighting themwith many pleasures, and they perish.11   For they forget the commandsof the living God, and live inluxury and in vain pleasures,and are corrupted by the evilangel, some of them even untodeath; and others to a fallingaway.12  I replied; I understand notwhat you mean, by saying untodeath, and to a falling away.Hear, says he; all those sheepwhich thou sawest exceedingjoyful, are such as have for everdeparted from God, and givenselves up to the lusts of thispresent time.13  To these therefore there isno return, by repentance, untolife; because, to their other sinsthey have added this, that theyhave blasphemed the name of thelord: These kind of men areordained unto death.14  But those sheep which thousawest not leaping, but feeding inone place; are such as have indeedgiven themselves up to pleasureand delights; but have not spokenanything wickedly against the Lord.15  These therefore are onlyfallen off from the truth, and sohave yet hope laid up for them inrepentance.  For such a falling offhath some hope still left of arenewal; but they that are dead,are utterly gone for ever.16  Again we went a little fartherforward, and he showed me a greatshepherd, who had as it were a rusticfigure; clad with a white goat's skin,having his bag upon his shoulder,and in his hand a stick full of knots,and very hard, and a whip in his otherhand; and his countenance was stern andsour, enough to affright a man;such was his look.17  He took from that youngshepherd such sheep as lived inpleasures, but did not skip up anddown; and drove them into acertain steep craggy place fall ofthorns and briars, insomuch thatthey could not get themselves freefrom them:18  But being entangled in them,fed upon thorns and briars, andwere grievously tormented withhis whipping. For he still drovethem on, and afforded them notany place, or time, to stand still.19  When therefore I saw them socruelly whipped and afflicted,I was grieved for them; becausethey were greatly tormented, norhad they any rest afforded them.20  And I said unto the shepherdthat was with me: Sir, who is thiscruel and implacable shepherd, whois moved with no compassion towardsthese sheep? He answered, Thisshepherd is indeed one of the holyangels, but is appointed for thepunishment of sinners.21  To him therefore are deliveredthose who have erred from God,and served the lusts and pleasuresof this world. For this cause hepunishes them every one accordingto their deserts, with cruel andvarious kinds of pains.22  Sir, said I, I would knowwhat kind of pains they are whichevery one undergoes? Hearken,said he; The several pains andtorments are those which menevery day undergo in their presentlives.    For some  suffer losses;others poverty; others diverssicknesses. Some are unsettled; otherssuffer injuries from those that areunworthy; others fall under manyother trials and inconveniences.23  For many with an unsettleddesign at many things, and itprofiteth them not; and they saythat they have not success in theirundertakings.24  They do not call to theirmind what they have done amiss,and they complain of the Lord.When therefore they shall haveundergone all kind of vexationand inconvenience; then they aredelivered over to me for goodinstruction, and are confirmedin the Faith of the Lord, andserve the Lord all the rest oftheir days with a pure mind.25 And when they begin to repentof their sins, then they call tomind their works which they havedone amiss, and give honour toGod, saying, that he is a justJudge, and they have deservedlysuffered all things according totheir deeds.26 Then for what remains oftheir lives, they serve God with apure mind; and have success inall their undertakings, and receivefrom the Lord whatever they desire.27  And then they give thanksunto the Lord that they weredelivered unto me; nor do theysuffer any more cruelty.28  I said unto him; Sir, I entreatyou still to show me now one thing.What, said he, dost thou ask?I said unto him; Are they whodepart from the fear of God,tormented for the same time thatthey enjoyed their false delightand pleasures? He answered me;they are tormented for the sametime.29  And I said unto him; Theyare then tormented but little;whereas they who enjoy theirpleasures so as to forget God,ought to endure seven times asmuch punishment.30  He answered me; Thou artfoolish, neither understandest thouthe efficacy of this punishment.I said unto him; Sir, if I understoodit, I would not desire you to tell me.31  Hearken, said he, and learnwhat the force of both is, both ofthe pleasure and of the punishment.An hour of pleasure is terminatedwithin its own space: but one hourof punishment has the efficacy ofthirty days.   a Whosoever thereforeenjoys his false pleasure for one day,and is one day, tormented; that oneday of punishment is equivalent toa whole year's space.32 Thus look how many daysany one pursues his pleasures, somany years is he punished for it.You see therefore how that thetime of worldly enjoyments is butshort; but that of pain and torments,a great deal more.33  I replied; Sir, forasmuch asI do not understand at all thesetimes of pleasure and pain; Ientreat you that you would explainyourself more clearly concerningthem. He answered me, saying;Thy foolishness still sticks untothee.34.  Shouldst thou not ratherpurify thy mind, and serve God?Take heed, lest when thy time isfulfilled, thou be found stillunwise. Hear then, as thou desirest,that thou mayest the more easilyunderstand.35  He that gives himself up oneday to his pleasures and delights,and does whatsoever his soul desires,is full of great folly, nor understandswhat he does, but the day followingforgets what he did the day before.36  For delight and worldlypleasure are not kept in memory,by reason of the folly that is rootedin them.  But when pain and tormentbefal a man a day, he is in effecttroubled the whole year after;because his punishment continuesfirm in his memory.37  Wherefore he remembers itwith sorrow the whole year; andthen calls to mind his vain pleasureand delight, and perceives that forthe sake of that he was punished.38  Whosoever therefore havedelivered themselves over to suchpleasures, are thus punished; becausethat when they had life, they renderedthemselves liable to death.39  I said unto him; Sir, whatpleasures are hurtful? He answered;That is pleasure to every manwhich he doth willingly.40  For the angry man, gratifyinghis passion, perceives pleasurein it; and so the adulterer, anddrunkard; the slanderer and liar;the covetous man and the defrauder;and whosoever commits anything likeunto these, he followeth his evildisposition, because he receivesa satisfaction in the doing of it.41  All these pleasures and delightsare hurtful to the servants of God.For these therefore they are tormentedand suffer punishment.42  There are also pleasures thatbring salvation unto men. For many,when they do what is good, findpleasure in it, and are attractedby the delights of it.43  Now this pleasure is profitableto the servants of God, and bringslife to such men; but those hurtfulpleasures, which were before mentioned,bring torments and punishment.44  And whosoever shall continuein them, and shall not repent ofwhat they have done, shall bringdeath upon themselves.SIMILITUDE VII.     That they who repent, must bring forth,     fruits worthy of repent once.AFTER a few days I saw thesame person that before talkedwith me, in the same field, inwhich I had seen those shepherds,And he said unto me; What seekestthou? Sir, said I, I came to entreatyou that You would command theshepherd, who is the minister ofpunishment, to depart out of myhouse, because he greatly afflictsme.3  And he answered, It is necessaryfor thee to endure inconvenienciesand vexations; for so that good angelhath commanded concerning thee,because he would try thee.4  Sir, said I; What so greatoffence have I committed, that Ishould be delivered to this messenger?Hearken, said he: Thou art indeedguilty of many sins, yet not somany that thou shouldest bedelivered to this messenger.5  But thy house hath committedmany sins and offences, and thereforethat good messenger being grievedat their doings commanded that forsome time thou shouldst sufferaffliction; that they may bothrepent of what they have done, andmay wash themselves from all thelusts of this present world.6  When therefore they shall haverepented, and be purified, then thatmessenger which is appointed overthy punishment, shall depart fromthee.7  I said unto him; Sir, if theyhave behaved themselves so as toanger that good angel, yet whathave I done? He answered: Theycannot otherwise be afflicted,unless thou, who art the headof the family, suffer.8  For whatsoever thou shaltsuffer, they must needs feel itbut as long as thou shalt standwell established, they cannotexperience any vexation.9  I replied; But, sir, beholdthey also now repent with all theirhearts. I know, says he, that theyrepent with all their hearts; butdost thou therefore think that theiroffences who repent, are immediatelyblotted out.10  No, they are not presently;but he that repents must afflict hissoul and show himself humble inall his affairs, and undergo manyand divers vexations.11  And when he shall have sufferedall things that were appointed for him;then perhaps HE that made him, andformed all things besides, will bemoved with compassion towards him,and afford him some remedy; andespecially if HE shall perceivehis heart who repents, to be freefrom every evil work.12  But at present it is expedientfor thee, and for thy house, to begrieved; and it is needful thatthou shoudest endure much vexation,as the angel of the Lord who committedthee unto me, has commanded.13  Rather give thanks unto theLord, that knowing what was tocome he thought thee worthy, towhom he should foretel that troublewas coming upon thee, who art ableto bear it.14  I said unto him; Sir, but bethou also with me, and I shalleasily undergo any trouble. I will,said he, be with thee; and I willentreat the messenger who is setover thy punishment, that hewould moderate his afflictionstowards thee.15  And moreover thou shaltsuffer adversity but for a littletime; and then thou shalt againbe restored to thy former state;only continue on in the humilityof thy mind.16  Obey the Lord with a pureheart; thou, and thy house, andthy children; and. walk in thecommands which I have deliveredunto thee; and then thy repentancemay be firm and pure.17  And if thou shalt keepthese things with thy house, thyinconveniencies shall depart from thee.18  And all vexation shall in likemanner depart from those, whosoevershall walk according to these commands.SIMILITUDE VIII.     That there are many kinds of elect, and of     repenting sinners: and how all of theca shall     receive a reward proportionable to the measure     of their repentance and good works.AGAIN he showed me a willowwhich covered the fields andthe mountains, under whose shadowcame all such as were called bythe name of the Lord.2  And by that willow stood an.angel of the Lord very excellentand lofty, and did cut down bowsfrom the willow with a greathook; and reached out to the peoplethat were under the shadow of thewillow, little rods, as it wereabout a foot long.3  And when all of them hadtaken them, he laid aside his hook,and the tree continued entire, as Ihad before seen it; at which Iwondered, and mused within myself.4  Then that shepherd said untome; Forbear to wonder that thetree continues whole,not-with-standing so many boughs havebeen cut off from it: but stay alittle, for now it shall be shownthee, what that angel means, whogave those rods to the people.5  So he again demanded therods of them; and in the sameorder that every one had receivedthem, was he called to him, andrestored his rod; which when hehad received, he examined them.6  From some he received themdry and rotten, and as it weretouched with the moth; those hecommanded to be separated fromthe rest, and placed by themselves.Others gave in their rods dryindeed, but not touched with themoth: these also he ordered to beset by themselves.7  Others gave in their rods halfdry; these also were set apart,Others gave in their rods half dryand cleft; these too were set bythemselves. Others brought intheir rods half dry and half green,and these were in like mannerplaced by themselves.8  Others delivered up their rodstwo parts green, and the thirddry; and they too were set apart.Others brought their rods twoparts dry, and the third green;and were also placed by themselves.9  Others delivered up their rodsless dry (for there was but a verylittle, to wit, their tops dry), butthey had clefts, and these were setin like manner by themselves. Inthe rods of others there was but alittle green, and the rest dry; andthese were set aside by themselves.10  Others came, and broughttheir rods green as they hadreceived them, and the greatestpart of the people brought theirrods thus; and the messengergreatly rejoiced at these, and theyalso were put apart by themselves.11  Others brought in their rodsnot only green, but full of branches;and these were set aside, beingalso received by the angelwith great joy. Others broughttheir rods green with branches,and those also some fruit uponthem.12  They who had such rods,were very cheerful; and the angelhimself took great joy at them;nor was the shepherd that stoodwith me, less pleased with them.13  Then the angel of the Lordcommanded crowns to be brought,and the crowns were brought madeof palms; and the angel crownedthose men in whose rods he foundthe young branches with fruit, andcommanded them to go into thetower.14  He also sent those into thetower, in whose hands he foundbranches without fruit, giving aseal unto them. For they had thesame garment, that is, one whiteas snow; with which he bade themgo into the tower   And so he didto those who returned their rodsgreen as they had received them;giving them a white garment, andso sent them away to go into thetower.15  Having done this, he said tothe shepherd that was with me,I go my way; but do thou sendthese within the walls, every oneinto the place in which he hasdeserved to dwell; examining firsttheir rods, but examine themdiligently that no one deceive thee;and if any one shall escape thee,I will try them upon the altar.Having said this to the shepherd,he departed.16  After he was gone, the shepherdsaid unto me; Let us take the rodsfrom them, and plant them; ifperchance they may grow green again.I said unto him; Sir, how can thosedry rods ever grow green again?17  He answered me; That tree.is a willow, and always loves tolive. If therefore these rods shallbe planted, and receive a littlemoisture, many of them willrecover themselves.18  Wherefore I will try, andwill pour water upon them, and ifany of them can live, I will rejoicewith them; but if not, at least bythis means I shall be found notto have neglected my part.19  Then he commanded me tocall them; and they all cameunto him, every one in the rankin which he stood, and gave himtheir rods; which having receivedhe planted every one of them intheir several orders.20  And after he had plantedthem all, he poured much waterupon them, insomuch that theywere covered with water, and didnot appear above it. Then whenhe had watered them, he said untome; Let us depart, and after alittle time we will return and visitthem.21  For he who created this tree,would have all those live thatreceived rods from it.   And I hopenow that these rods are thuswatered, many of them receivingin the moisture, will recover:22  I said unto him, Sir, tellme what this tree denotes? For Iam greatly astonished, that afterso many branches have been cutoff, it seems still to be whole:nor does there any thing the lessof it appear to remain, whichgreatly amazes me.23  He answered, Hearken. Thisgreat tree which covers the plainsand the mountains, and all theearth, is the law of God, publishedthroughout the whole world.24  Now this law is the Son ofGod, who is preached to all theends of the earth. The peoplethat stand under its shadow, arethose which have heard his preaching,and believed.25  The great and venerableangel which you saw, was Michaelwho had the power over his people,and governs them. For he hasplanted the law in the heartsof those who have believed: andtherefore he visits them to whomlie has given the law, to see ifthey have kept it.26  And he examines everyone's rod; and of those, many thatare weakened: for those rods arethe law of the Lord. Then he discernsall those who have not kept the law,knowing the place of every one of them.27  I said unto him, Sir, whydid he send away some to thetower, and left others here to you?He replied, those who havetransgressed the law, which theyreceived from him, are left in mypower, that they may repent oftheir sins: but they who fulfilledthis law and kept it, are under hispower.28 But who then, said I, arethose, who went into the towercrowned? He replied, all such ashaving striven with the devil, haveovercome him, are crowned: andthey are those, who have sufferedhard things, that they might keepthe law.29  But they who gave up theirrods green, and with youngbranches, but without fruit, haveindeed endured trouble for thesame law, but have not suffereddeath; neither have they deniedtheir holy law.30  They who delivered up theirrods green as they received them,are those who were modest andjust, and have lived with avery pure mind, and kept thecommandments of God.31  The rest thou shalt know,when I shall have considered thoserods which I have planted andwatered.32  After a few days we returned,and in the same place stood thatglorious angel, and I stood by him.Then he said unto me; Gird thyselfwith a towel, and serve me.33  And I girded myself witha clean towel, which was made ofcoarse cloth. And when he sawme girded, and ready to ministerunto him, he said, Call those menwhose rods have been planted,every one in his order as hegave them.34  And he brought me into thefield, and I called them all,and they all stood ready in theirseveral ranks. Then he said untothem; let every one pluck up hisrod, and bring it unto me. Andfirst they delivered theirs, whoserods had been dry and rotten.35  And those whose rods stillcontinued so, he commanded tostand apart. Then they camewhose rods had been dry but notrotten. Some of these delivered.in their rods green; others dryand rotten, as if they had beentouched by the moth.36  Those who gave them upgreen, he commanded to standapart: but those whose rods weredry and rotten, he caused to standwith the first sort. Then camethey whose rods had been halfdry, and cleft: many of thesegave up their rods green, anduncleft.37  Others delivered them upgreen with branches, like untotheirs who went crowned into thetower. Others delivered themup dry, but not rotten; and somegave them up as they were before,all dry, and cleft.38  Every one of these he orderedto stand apart; some by themselves,others in their respective ranks.32  Then came they whose rodshad been green, but cleft. Thesedelivered their rods altogethergreen, and stood in their ownorder. And the shepherd rejoicedat these, because they were allchanged, and free from theirclefts.40  Then they gave in their rods,who had them half green andhalf dry. Of these some werefound wholly green, others halfdry: others green, with youngshoots.   And all these were sentaway, every one to his properrank.41  Then they gave up theirrods, who had them before twoparts green, and the third dry.Many of those gave in their rodsgreen; many half dry; the restdry but not rotten. So these weresent away, each to his properplace.42  Then came they who beforehad their rods two parts dry andthe third green; many of thesedelivered up their rods half dry,others dry and rotten; others halfdry and cleft: but few green. Andall these were set every one in hisown rank.43  Then they reached in theirrods, in which there was beforebut a little green, and the restdry. Their rods were for themost part found green, havinglittle boughs, with fruit uponthem; and the rest altogethergreen.44  And the shepherd upon sightof these rejoiced exceedingly,because he had found them thus;and they also went to theirproper orders.45  Now after he had examinedall their rods, he said unto me,I told thee that this tree lovedlife thou seest how many haverepented, and attained untosalvation. Sir, said I, I see it.46  That thou mightest knowsaith he, that the goodness andmercy of the Lord is great, andto be had in honour; who gavehis spirit to them that were foundworthy of repentance.47  I answered, Sir, why thendid not all of them repent? Hereplied, Those whose minds theLords foresaw would be pure, andthat they would serve him withall their hearts, to them he gaverepentance.48  But for those whose deceitand wickedness he beheld, andperceived that they would nottruly return unto him; to themhe denied any return untorepentance, lest they should againblaspheme his law with wickedwords.49  I said unto him; Now, Sir,make known unto me, what is theplace of every one of those, whohave given up their rods, andwhat their portion; that whenthey may have not kept their sealentire, but have wasted the sealwhich they received, shall hearand believe these thins, and mayacknowledge their evil deeds andrepent;50  And receiving again theirseal from you, may give glory toGod, that he was moved withcompassion towards them, and sentyou to renew their spirits.51  Hearken, said he; theywhose rods have been foundand rotten, and as it were touchwith the moth; are the desertersand the betrayers of the church;52  Who with the rest of theircrimes, have also blasphemed theLord, and denied his name whenhe had called upon them. Thereforeall these are dead unto Godand thou seest that none of themhave repented, although theyhave heard my commands whichthou bast delivered unto them.From these men therefore life isfar distant.53 They also who have deliveredup their rods dry, but not rotten,have not been far from them. Forthey have been counterfeits,and brought in evil doctrines,and have perverted the servantsof God, especially thosewho had sinned; not sufferingthem to return unto repentance,but keeping them back by theirfalse doctrines.54  These therefore have hope;and thou seest that many of themhave repented, since the timethat thou hast laid my commandsbefore them; and many morewill yet repent. But they, thatshall not repent; shall lose bothrepentance and life.55  But they that have repented,their place is begun to be withinthe first walls, and some of themare even gone into the tower.Thou seest therefore, said he, thatin the repentance of sinners thereis life; but for those who repentnot, death is prepared.56  Hear now   concerningthose who gave in their rods halfdry and full of clefts. Those whoserods were only half dry, are thedoubtful; for they are neitherliving nor dead.57  But they who delivered intheir rods, not only half dry butalso full of clefts, are both doubtfuland evil speakers; who detract fromthose that are absent, and havenever peace among themselves,and who envy one another.58  Howbeit, to those alsorepentance is offered; for thouseest that some of these haverepented.59  Now all those of this kindwho have quickly repented, shallhave a place in the tower; andthey who have been more slow intheir repentance, shall dwellwithin the walls: but they that shallnot repent, and shall continue onin their wicked doings, shall diethe death.60  As for those who had theirrods green, but yet cleft; theyare such as were always faithfuland good, but they had some envyand strife among themselvesconcerning dignity and pre-eminence.61  Now all such as are vain, andwithout understanding, contendwith one another about thesethings.62  Nevertheless, seeing theyare otherwise good, if when theyshall hear these commands theyshall amend themselves, and shallat my persuasion suddenly repent;they shall at last dwell in thetower, like those who have trulyand worthily repented.63  But if any one shall againreturn to his dissension; he shallbe shut out from the tower, andshall lose his life. For the lifeof those who keep the commandmentsof the Lord, consists in doingwhat they are commanded; not inprincipality, or in any otherdignity.64  For by forbearance and humilityof mind, men shall attain unto life;but by seditions and contempt of thelaw, they shall purchase death untothemselves.65  They who in their rodshad half dry and half green, arethose who are engaged in manyaffairs of the world, and are notjoined to the saints. For whichcause half of them liveth, andhalf is dead.66  Wherefore many of thesesince the time that they haveheard my commands, have repented,and begun to dwell in the tower.But some of them havewholly fallen away; to these thereis no more place for repentance.67  For by reason of their presentinterests, they have blasphemedand denied God: and for thiswickedness they have lost life.And of these many are still indoubt, yet these may return; andif they shall quickly repent, theyshall have a place in the tower;but if they shall be more slow,they shall dwell within the walls;but if they shall not repent, theyshall die.68  As for those who had twoparts of their rods green, and thethird dry; they have by manifoldways denied the Lord. Of thesemany have repented, and founda place in the tower: and manyhave altogether departed fromGod. These have utterly lost life.69  And some being in a doubtfulstate, have raise up dissensions:these may yet return, if theyshall suddenly repent and notcontinue in their lusts; but ifthey shall continue in theirevil-doing they shall die.70  They who gave in theirrods two parts dry, and the otherbeen, are those who have indeedbeen faithful, but withal rich andfull of good things; and thereuponhave desired to be famousamong the heathen which arewithout, and have thereby falleninto great pride, and begun toaim at high matters, and toforsake the truth.71  Nor were they joined to thesaints, but lived with the heathen;and this life seemed the more pleasantto them. Howbeit they have notdeparted from God, but continuedin the faith; only they havenot wrought the works of faith.72  Many therefore of these haverepented; and begun to dwell inthe tower. Yet others still livingamong the heathen. people, andbeing lifted up with their vanities,have utterly fallen away fromGod, and followed the works andwickedness of the heathen.These kind of men therefore arereckoned among strangers to theGospel.73 Others of these began to bedoubtful in their minds; despairingby reason of their wicked doingsever to attain unto salvationOthers being thus made doubtful,did moreover stir up dissensions.74  To these therefore, and tothose who by reason of their doingsare become doubtful, there is stillhope of return; but they must repentquickly, that their place may be inthe tower. But they that repent not,and continue still in their pleasures,are nigh unto death.75   As for those who gave intheir rods green, excepting theirtops, which only were dry, andhad clefts; these were alwaysgood, and faithful, and uprightbefore God: nevertheless theysinned a little, by reason of theirempty pleasures and triflingthoughts which they had withinthemselves.76  Wherefore many of themwhen they heard my words,repented forthwith, and began todwell in the tower. Neverthelesssome grew doubtful, and othersto their doubtful minds addeddissensions. To these thereforethere is still hope of return,because they were always good;but they shall not hardly be moved.77  As for those, lastly, whogave in their rods dry, their topsonly excepted, which alone weregreen; they are such as havebelieved indeed in God, but havelived in wickedness; yet withoutdeparting from God: having alwayswillingly borne the name of theLord, and readily received intotheir houses the servants of God.78  Wherefore hearing thesethings they returned, and withoutdelay repented, and lived in allrighteousness. And some of themsuffered death: others readilyunderwent many trials, beingmindful of their evil doings.79  If And when he had endedhis explications of all the rods,he said unto me, Go, and say untoall men that they repent, and theyshall live unto God; because theLord being moved with greatclemency hath sent me to preachrepentance unto all:80  Even unto those who byreason of their evil doings, deservenot to attain unto salvation. Butthe Lord will by patient, and keepthe invitation that was made byhis Son.81  I said unto him, sir, I hopethat all when they shall hear thesethings, will repent. For I trustthat everyone acknowledging hiscrimes, and taking up the fearof the Lord, will return untorepentance.82  He said unto me, Whosoevershall repent with all theirhearts, and cleanse themselvesfrom all the evils that I havebefore mentioned, and not addanything more to their sins,shall receive from the Lord cureof their former iniquities, if they donot make any doubt of these commands,and shall live unto God.83  But they that shall continueto add to their transgressions, andstill converse with the lusts ofthe present world, shall condemnthemselves unto death. But dothou walk in these commands, andwhosoever shall Walk in these, andexercise them rightly, shall liveunto God.84  And having showed me allthese things, he said; I will showthee the rest in a few days.SIMILITUDE IX.     The greatest mysteries of the militant and     triumphant Church which is to be built.AFTER I had Written the Commandsand similitudes of the Shepherd,the Angel of Repentance came untome, and said to me, I will showthee all those things which theSpirit spake with thee underthe figure of the church. Forthat Spirit is the Son of God.2  And because thou wert weakin body, it was not declared untothee by the angel, until thou wertstrengthened by the Spirit, andincreased in force, that thoumightest also see the angel:3  For then indeed the buildingof the tower was very well andgloriously shown unto thee by thechurch; nevertheless thou sawestall things shown unto thee as itwere by a virgin.4  But now thou art enlightenedby the angel, and yet by the sameSpirit. But thou must considerall things diligently; for therefoream I sent into thy house by thatvenerable messenger, that whenthou shalt have seen all thingspowerfully, thou mayest not beafraid as before.5  And he led me to the heightof a mountain in Arcadia, and wesat upon its top. And he showedme a great plain, and about ittwelve mountains in differentfigures.6  The first was black as soot.The second was smooth, withoutherbs. The third was full ofthorns and thistles. The fourthhad herbs half dried; of whichthe upper part was green, but thatnext the root was dry; and someof the herbs, when the sun grewhot, were dry.7  The fifth mountain was veryrugged; but yet had green herbs.The sixth mountain was full ofclefts, some lesser, and somegreater; and in these clefts grewgrass, not flourishing, but whichseemed to be withering.8  The seventh mountain haddelightful pasture, and was whollyfruitful; and all kinds of cattle,and of the birds of heaven; fedupon it; and the more they fedon it, the more and better did thegrass grow.9  The eighth mountain was fullof fountains, and from thosefountains were watered all kinds ofthe creatures of Cod. The ninthmountain had no water at all, butwas wholly destitute of it; andnourished deadly serpents, verydestructive to men.10  The tenth mountain was fullof tall trees, and altogether shady;and under the shade of them laycattle resting and chewing the cud.11  The eleventh mountain wasfull of the thickest trees, andthose trees seemed to be loadedwith several sorts of fruits; thatwhosoever saw them could not choosebut desire to eat of their fruit.12  The twelfth mountain wasaltogether white, and of a mostpleasant aspect, and itself gave amost excellent beauty to itself.13  In the middle of the plainhe showed me a huge white rock,which rose out of the plain, andthe rock was higher than thosemountains, and was square; sothat it seemed capable of supportingthe whole world.14  It looked to me to be old,yet it had in it a new gate, whichseemed to have been newly hewnout of it. Now that gate wasbright beyond the sun itself;insomuch, that I greatly wonderedat its light.15 About the gate stood twelvevirgins; of which four that stoodat the corners of the gate, seemedto me to be the chiefest, althoughthe rest were also of worth: andthey stood in the four parts of thegate.16  It added also to the grace ofthose virgins, that they stood inpairs, clothed with linen garments,and decently girded, their rightarms being at liberty, as if theywere about to lift up some burthen;for so they were adorned, and wereexceeding cheerful and ready.17  When I saw this, I wonderedwith myself to see such greatand noble things. And again Iadmired upon the account of thosevirgins, that they were so handsomeand delicate; and stood with suchfirmness and constancy, as if theywould carry the whole heaven.18  And as I was thinking thuswithin myself, the shepherd saidunto me; What thickest thou withinthyself? Why art thou disquieted,and fillest thyself with care?19  Do not seem to consider, asif thou wert wise, what thou doestnot understand, but pray unto theLord, that thou mayest have abilityto understand it. What is to comethou canst not understand, butthou seest that which is beforethee.20  Be not therefore disquietedat those things which thou canstnot see; but get the understandingof those which thou seest.21  Forbear to be curious; andI will show thee all things that Iought to declare unto thee: butfirst consider what yet remains.22  And when he had said this untome I looked up, and behold I sawsix tall and venerable men coming;their countenances were all alike,and they called a certain multitudeof men; and they who came at theircall were also tall and stout.23  And those six commandedthem to build a certain tower overthat gate. And immediately therebegan to be a great noise of thosemen running here and there aboutthe gate, who were come togetherto build the tower.24  But those virgins which stoodabout the gate perceived that thebuilding of the tower was to behastened by them. And theystretched out their hands, as ifthey were to receive somewhatfrom them to do.25  Then those six men commanded,that they should lift up stonesout of a certain deep place,and prepare them for the buildingof the tower. And there werelifted up ten white stones, square,and not cut round.26  Then those six men calledthe ten virgins to them, andcommanded them to carry all thestones that were to be put intothe building, and having carriedthem through the gate to deliverthem to those that were about tobuild the tower.27  Immediately the virgins beganall of them together to lift upthose stones, that were beforetaken out of the deep.28  And they who also stood aboutthe gate did carry stones in sucha manner, that those stones whichseemed to be the strongest werelaid at the corners, and the restwere put into the sides;29  And thus they carried all thestones, and bringing them throughthe gate delivered them to thebuilders, as they had beencommanded: who receiving themat their hands, built with them.30  But this building was madeupon that great rock, and over thegate; and by these the whole towerwas supported. But the buildingof the ten stones filled the wholegate, which began to be made forthe foundation of that tower.31  After those ten stones didfive and twenty others rise upout of the deep; and these wereplaced in the building of the sametower; being lifted up by thosevirgins, as the others had beenbefore.32 After these did fire and thirtyothers rise up; and these were alsoin like manner fitted into the samework. Then forty other stones werebrought up, and all these were addedunto the building of that tower.33  So there began to be fourranks in the foundation of thattower; and the stones ceased torise out of the deep; and theyalso which built rested a little.34  Again, those six men commandedthe multitude, that they shouldbring stones out of those twelvemountains to the building of thesame tower.35  So they cut out of all themountains stones of divers colours,and brought them and gave them tothe virgins; which when they hadreceived they carried them, anddelivered them into the buildingof the tower.36 In which when they were builtthey became white, and differentfrom what they were before; forthey were all alike, and didchange their former colours.And some were reached up by themen themselves, which when theycame into the building, continuedsuch is they were put in.37  These neither became white,nor different from what they werebefore; because they were notcarried by the virgins throughthe gate. Wherefore these stoneswere disagreeable in the building;which, when these six men perceivedthey commanded them to be removed,and put again in the place fromwhich they were brought.38  And they said to those whobrought these stones; Do not yereach up to us any stones for thisbuilding, but lay them down bythe tower, that these virgins maycarry them and reach them to us.39  For unless they shall becarried by these virgins throughthis gate, they cannot change theircolours: therefore do not labourin vain.40  So the building that daywas done; howbeit the tower wasnot finished, for it was afterwardsto be built; therefore now alsothere was some delay made of it.41  And these six men commandedthose that built to depart, andas it were to rest for some time;but they ordered those virginsthat they should not depart fromthe tower; so now they seemedto me to be left for the guardingof it.42  When all were departed,I said unto the shepherd; Sir,why is not the building of thetower finished? Because it cannot,said he, be finished until its Lordcomes, and approves of the building;that if he shall find any stonesin it that are not good they maybe changed; for this tower is builtaccording to his will.43  Sir, said I, I would knowwhat the building of this towersignifies; as also I would beinformed concerning this rock,and this gate;44  And concerning the mountains,and the virgins, and the stonesthat did rise out of the deep,and were not cut, but put intothe building just as they cameforth; and why the ten stoneswere first laid in the foundation;then the twenty-five, then thirty-five; then forty?45  Also concerning those stonesthat were put into the building,and again taken out, and carriedback into their places? Fulfil, Ipray, the desire of my soul as toall these things, and manifest allunto me.46  And he said unto me; If thoushalt not be dull, thou shallknow all, and shall see all theother things that are about tohappen in this, tower: and shallunderstand diligently all thesesimilitudes.47  And after a few days wecame into the same place wherewe had sat before; and he saidunto me, Let us go unto thetower; for the Lord of it willcome and examine it.48  So we came thither, andfound none but those virgins there.And he asked them whether theLord of that tower was comethither? And they replied, thathe would be there presently toexamine the building.49  After a very little while Isaw a great multitude of mencoming, and in the middle of thema man so tall, that he surpassedthe tower in height.50  About him were those six,who before commanded in thebuilding, and all the rest ofthose who had built that tower,and many others of great dignity:and the virgins that kept the towerran to meet him, and kissed him,and began to walk near unto him.51  But he examined the buildingwith so much care, that he handledevery stone; and struck every onewith a rod which he held in his hand:52  Of which some being so struckturned black as soot; others wererough; some looked as if they hadcracks in them; others seemed maimed;some neither black nor white; somelooked sharp, and agreed not with theother stones, and others were fullof spots.53  These were the several kindsof those stones which were notfound proper in the building; allwhich the Lord commanded to betaken out of the tower, and laidnear it, and other stones to bebrought and put in their places.54  And they that built, askedhim from which of the mountainshe would have stones brought toput in the place of those that werelaid aside. But he forbad themto bring any from the mountains,and commanded that they shouldtake them out of a certain fieldthat was near.55  So they digged in the field,and found many bright squarestones, and some also that wereround. Howbeit, all that werefound in that field were takenaway, and carried through thegate by those virgins; and thoseof them that were square werefitted and put into the places ofthose that were pulled out.56  But the round ones were notput into the building, because theywere hard, and it would haverequired too much time to cut thembut they were placed about thetower, as if they should hereafterbe cut square, and put into thebuilding; for they were verywhite.57  When he who was chief indignity, and lord of the wholetower saw this, he called to himthe shepherd that was with me,and gave him the stones that wererejected and laid about the tower,and said unto him; cleanse thesestones with all care, and fit theminto the building of the tower, thatthey may agree with the rest; butthose that will not suit with therest, cast away afar off from thetower.58 When he had thus commanded him,he departed, with all those thatcame with him to the tower butthose virgins still stood aboutthe tower to keep it.59  And I said unto that shepherd;How can these stones, seeing theyhave been rejected, return intothe building of this tower?He replied; I will cut off thegreatest part from these stones,and will add them to the building,and they will agree with the rest.60  And I said, Sir, how willthey be able to fill the same place,when they shall be so much cutaway? He answered; They thatshall be found too little shall beput into the middle of the building,and the greater shall be placedwithout, and keep them in.61  When he had said thus untome, he added; Let us go, and afterthree days we will return, andI will put these stones, beingcleansed, into the tower.62  For all these that are aboutthe tower must be cleansed, lestthe master of the house chance tocome upon the sudden, and findthose which are about the towerunclean; and be so exasperatedthat these stones should never beput into the building of this tower,and I shall be looked upon to havebeen unmindful of my master'scommands.63  When therefore we cameafter three days to the tower,he said unto me; Let us examineall these stones, and let us seewhich of them may go into thebuilding. I answered, Sir,let us see.64  And first of all we beganto consider those which had beenblack; for they were found justsuch as they were when they werepulled out of the tower: whereforehe commanded them to be removedfrom the tower and put by themselves.65  Then he examined thosewhich had been rough; and commandedmany of those to be cut round, andto be fitted by the virgins intothe building of the tower; so theytook them, and fitted them intothe middle of the building andhe commanded the rest to be laidby with the black ones, for theyalso were become black.66 Next he considered thosewhich were full of cracks, andmany of those also he ordered tobe pared away, and so to be addedto the rest of the building, by thecame virgins.67  These were placed withoutbecause they were found entire;but the residue through themultitude of their cracks couldnot be reformed, and thereforewere cast away from the buildingof the tower.68  Then he considered thosethat had been maimed; many ofthese had cracks, and were becomeblack; others had large clefts;these he commanded to be placedwith those that were reected;69  But the rest being cleansedand reformed, he commanded tobe put into the building. Thesetherefore those virgins took up,and fitted into the middle of thebuilding, because they were butweak.70 After these he examined thosewhich were found half white andhalf black, and many of thosewhich were now black; these alsohe ordered to be laid amongthose that were cast away.71 The rest were found altogetherwhite; those were taken up by thevirgins, and fitted into the sametower: and they were put in theoutside, because they were foundentire; that so they might keepin those that were placed in themiddle, for nothing was cut offfrom them.72  Next he looked upon thosewhich had been hard and sharp;but few of these were made use of,because they could not be cut, forthey were found very hard: butthe rest were formed, and fitted bythe virgins into the middle of thebuilding, because they were moreweak.73  Then he considered thosewhich had spots; of these a fewwere found black, and they werecarried to their fellows. The restwere white and entire; and theywere fitted by the virgins into thebuilding, and placed in the outside,by reason of their strength.74  After this he came toconsider those stones which werewhite and round: and he said untome, What shall we do with thesestones? I answered, Sir, I cannottell.75  He replied, Canst thouthink of nothing then for these?I answered, Sir, I understand notthis art; neither am I a stone-cutter,nor can I tell anything.76  And he said, seest thou notthat they are very round? Nowto make them square, I must cutoff a great deal from them; howbeit,it is necessary that some of theseshould go into the building of thetower.77  I answered; If it be necessary,why do you perplex yourself, andnot rather choose, if you haveany choice among them, and fitthem into the building.78  Upon this he chose out thelargest and brightest, and squaredthem; which, when he had donethe virgins took them up, andfitted them into the building.79  And the rest that remainedwere carried back into the samefield from which they were taken;howbeit, they were not cast away;because, said he, there is yet alittle wanting to this tower, whichis to be built; and perhaps theLord will have these stones fittedinto this building, because theyare exceeding white.80  Then there were called twelvevery stately women, clothed witha black garment, girded, and theirshoulders free, and their hairloose. These seemed to me to becountry women.81  And the shepherd commandedthem to take up those stoneswhich were cast out of the building,and carry them back to the mountainsout of which they were taken.82  And they took them all upjoyfully, and carried them back totheir places from whence they hadbeen taken.83  When not one stone remainedabout the tower, he said untome, Let us go about this tower,and see whether anything bewanting to it.84  We began therefore to goround about it; and when he sawthat it was handsomely built, hebegan to be very glad; for it wasso beautifully framed, that any onethat had seen it must have been inlove with the building.85  For it seemed to be all butone stone, nor did a joint anywhere appear; but it looked as ifit had all been cut out of one rock.86  And when I diligentlyconsidered what a tower it was,I was extremely pleased: and hesaid unto me, Bring hither somelime and little shells, that I mayfill up the spaces of those stonesthat were taken out of the building,and put in again; for all thingsabout the tower must be made even.87  And I did as he commandedme, and brought them unto himand he said unto me, Be ready tohelp me, and this work will quicklybe finished.88  He therefore filled upthe spaces of those stones, andcommanded the place about the towerto be cleansed.89  Then those virgins took besoms,and cleansed all the place around,and took away all the rubbish,and threw water on; which beingdone, the palace became delightful,and the tower beauteous.90  Then he said unto me, Allis now clean if the Lord shouldcome to finish the tower, he willfind nothing whereby to complainof us.91  When he had said this hewould have departed. But I laidhold on his bag, and began toentreat him for the Lord's sake, thathe would explain to me all thingsthat he had shown me.92  He said unto me, I have atpresent a little business; but Iwill suddenly explain all thingsunto thee. Tarry here for me tillI come.93  I said unto him, Sir, whatshall I do here alone? He answered,Thou art not alone, seeing allthese virgins are with thee.94  I said, Sir, deliver me thenunto them. Then he called themand said unto them, I commendthis man unto you until I shallcome;95  So I remained with thosevirgins: now they were cheerfuland courteous unto me; especiallythe four, which seemed to bethe chieftest among them.96  Then those virgins saidunto me, that shepherd will notreturn hither to-day. I said untothem, What then shall I do? Theyanswered, Tarry for him till theevening, if perhaps he may comeand speak with thee; but if not,yet thou shalt continue with ustill he does come.97  I said unto them, I willtarry for him till evening; but ifhe comes not by that time, I willgo home, and return hither againthe next morning.98  They answered me, As thouart delivered unto us, thou mayestnot depart from us. I said, Whereshall I tarry?99  They replied, Thou shaltsleep with us as a brother, notas a husband; for thou art ourbrother, and we are ready fromhenceforth to dwell with thee;for thou art very dear to as.100  Howbeit I was ashamed tocontinue with them. But she thatseemed to be the chieftest amongstthem, embraced me, and beganto kiss me. And the rest whenthey saw that I was kissed by her,began also to kiss me as a brother;and led me about the tower, andplayed with me.101  Some of them also sungpsalms, others made up the choruswith them. But I walked aboutthe tower with them, rejoicingsilently, and seeming to myselfto be grown young again.102  When the evening came on,I would forthwith have gonehome, but they withheld me,and suffered me not to depart.Wherefore I continued with themthat night near the same tower.103  So they spread their linengarments upon the ground; andplaced me in the middle, nor didthey anything else, only theyprayed.104  I also prayed with themwithout ceasing, nor less thanthey. Who, when they saw me prayin that manner, rejoiced greatly:and I continued there with theirtill the next day.105  And when we had worshipped God,then the shepherd came and said untothem: You have done no injury tothis man? They answered, Ask him.I said unto him, Sir, I have receiveda great deal of satisfaction in thatI have remained with them.106  And he said unto me, How didstthou sup? I answered, Sir, I feastedthe whole night upon the words ofthe Lord. They received thee wellthen, said he? I said, Sir, very well.107  He answered, Wilt thounow learn what thou didst desire?I replied, Sir, I will: and first Ipray thee that thou shouldest showme all things in the order that Iasked them.108  He answered, I will do allas thou wouldst have me, norwill I hide any thing from thee.109  First of all, Sir, said I,tell me, what this rock and thisgate denote? Hearken, said he;this rock, and this gate, are theSon of God. I replied, Sir, howcan that be; seeing the rock isold, but the gate new?110  Hear, said he, O foolishman! and understand. The Sonof God is indeed more ancientthan any creature; insomuchthat he was in council with hisFather at the creation oft allthings.111  But the gate is thereforenew, because he appeared in thelast days in the fullness of time;that they who shall attain untosalvation, may by it enter into thekingdom of God.112  You have seen, said he,those stones which were carriedthrough the gate, how they wereplaced in the building of thetower; but that those which werenot carried through the gate,were sent away into their ownplaces?113 I answered, sir, I saw it.Thus, said he, no man shall enterinto the kingdom of God, but hewho shall take upon him the nameof the Son of God.114  For if you would enterinto any city, and that city shouldhe encompassed with a wall, andhad only one gate, could youenter into that city except by thatgate?115 I answered, Sir, how couldI do otherwise? As therefore, saidhe, there would be no other wayof entering into that city but byits gate, so neither can any oneenter into the kingdom of God,but only by the name of his Son,who is most dear unto him.116 And he said unto me,Didst thou see the multitude ofthose that built that tower? Sir,said I, I saw it. He answered,All those are the angels, venerablein their dignity,117  With those is the Lordencompassed as with a wall: butthe gate is the Son of God, who isthe only way of coming unto God.For no man shall go to God, butby his Son.118  Thou sawest also, said he,the six men, and in the middle ofthem that venerable great man,who walked about the tower, andrejected the stones out of the tower?119  Sir, said I, I saw them.He answered, that tall man wasthe Son of God; and those sixwere his angels of most eminentdignity, which stand about himon the right hand and on the left.120  Of these excellent angelsnone comes in unto God withouthim. He added, Whosoever there.fore shall not take upon him hisname, he shall nor enter into thekingdom of God.121  Then I said, What is thistower? This, said he, is the church.And what, Sir, are these virgins?He said unto me, These are theholy spirits, for no man can enterinto the kingdom of God, exceptthese clothe him with their garment,122  For it will avail thee nothingto take up the name of the Son ofGod, unless thou shalt alsoreceive their garment from them.For these virgins are the powersof the Son of God. So shall aman in vain bear his name, unlesshe shall be also endued with hispowers.123  And he said unto me, sawestthou those stones that were castaway? They bore indeed the name,but put not on their garment.I said, Sir, what is theirgarment? Their very names,said he, are their garment.124  Therefore whosoever beareththe name of the Son of God,ought to bear their names also;for the Son of God also himselfbeareth their names.125  As for those stones,continued he, which being deliveredby their hands, thou sawest remainin the building, they were clothedwith their power; for which causethou seest the whole tower of thesame colour with the rock, and madeas it were of one stone.126 So also those who havebelieved in God by his Son, haveput on his spirit. Behold thereshall be one spirit, and one body,and one colour of their garments;and all they shall attain this, whoshall bear the names of these virgins.127 And I said, Sir, why thenwere those stones cast away whichwere rejected, seeing they alsowere carried through the gate,and delivered by the hands ofthese virgins into the buildingof this tower?128 Seeing, said he thou takestcare to inquire diligently into allthings, hear also concerning thosestones which were rejected. Allthese received the name of theSon of God, and with that thepower of these virgins.129 Having therefore receivedthese spirits, they were perfected,and brought into the number ofthe servants of God; and theybegan to be one body, and to haveone garment, for they were enduedwith the same righteousness,which they alike exercised.130  But after that they beheldthose women which thou sawestclothed with a black garment,with their shoulders at liberty andtheir hair loose; they fixed theirdesires upon them, being temptedwith their beauty; and wereclothed with their power,and cast off the clothingof the virgins:131  Therefore were they castoff from the house of God, anddelivered to those women. Butthey that were not corrupted withtheir beauty, remained in thehouse of God. This, said he, isthe signification of those stoneswhich were rejected.132  And I said, sir, what ifany of these men shall repent, andcast away their desire of thosewomen, and be converted, andreturn to these virgins, and puton again their virtue; shall theynot enter into the house of God?133 They shall enter, said he,if they shall lay aside all theworks of those women, and shallresume the power of these virgins,and shall walk in their works.134 And for this cause there isa stop in the building, that if theyshall repent, they may be addedto the building of this tower; butif they shall not repent, that othersmay be built in their places, andso they may be utterly cast away.135 For all these things I gavethanks unto the Lord, that beingmoved with mercy towards allthose upon whom his name iscarried, he sent to us the angel ofrepentance to preside over us whohave sinned against him; and thathe has refreshed our spirits whichwere almost gone, and who hadno hope of salvation, but are nowrefreshed to the renewal of life.136  Then I said, Show me nowsir, why this tower is not builtupon the ground, but upon a rock,and upon the gate? He replied,Thou art foolish, and withoutunderstanding, therefore thouasketh this.137 And I said, sir, I mustneeds ask all things of youbecause I understand nothing at all.For all your answers are great andexcellent; and which a man canhardly understand.138  Hear, said he: The nameof the Son of God is great andwithout bounds, and the wholeworld is supported by it. Iftherefore, said I, every creatureof God be sustained by his Son,why should he not support thosealso who have been invited by him,and who carry his name, and walkin his commandments?139  Seest thou not, said he, thathe doth support them, who withall their heart, bear his name?He therefore is their foundation,and gladly supports those who donot deny his name, but willinglybear it.140 And I said: Sir, tell methe names of these virgins; and ofthose women that were clothedwith the black garment.141  Hear, said he, the names ofthose virgins which are the morepowerful, and stand at the cornersof the gate. These are theirnames:142 The first is called Faith;the second Continence; the thirdPower; the fourth Patience; therest which stand beneath theseare, Simplicity, Innocence,Chastity, Cheerfulness, Truth,Understanding, Concord, Charity.143  Whosoever therefore bearthese names, and the name of theSon of God, shall enter into thekingdom of God.144  Hear now, said he, thenames of those women, whichwere clothed with the black garment.Of these, four are the principal:the first is Perfidiousness;the second, Incontinence; thethird, Infidelity; the fourth,Pleasure.145 And the rest which followare called thus, Sadness, Malice,Lust, Anger, Lying, Foolishness,Pride, and Hatred. The servantof God, which carries these spirits,shall see indeed the kingdom ofGod, but he shall not enter into it.146  But, sir, what are thosestones which were taken out of thedeep and fitted into the building?The ten, said he, which wereplaced at the foundation, are thefirst age; the following five-and-twenty, are the second, of righteousmen.147  The next thirty-five, are theprophets and ministers of the Lord.And the forty, are the Apostles anddoctors of the preaching of theSon of God.148  And I said, sir, why did thevirgins put even those stones intothe building after they were carriedthrough the gate? And he said,Because these first carried thosespirits, and they departed not onefrom the other, neither the menfrom the spirits, nor the spiritsfrom the men:149  But the spirits were joinedto those men even to the day oftheir death; who if they had nothad these spirits with them, theycould not have been useful to thebuilding of this tower.150  And I said, sir, show methis farther.  He answered, Whatdost then ask? Why did thesestones come out of the deep, andwere placed into the building ofthis tower, seeing that they longago carried those holy spirits?151  It was necessary, said he,for them to ascend by water, thatthey might be at rest. For theycould not otherwise enter into thekingdom of God, but by layingaside the mortality of their formerlife.152  They therefore being dead,were nevertheless sealed with theseal of the Son of God, and soentered into the kingdom of God.153  For before a man receivesthe name of the Son of God, he isordained unto death; but when hereceives that seal, he is freed fromdeath, and assigned unto life.154  Now that seal is the waterof baptism, into which men godown under the obligation untodeath, but come up appointed untolife.155 Wherefore to those also wasthis seal preached, and they madeuse of it, that they might enterinto the kingdom of God.156  And I said, Why then, sir,did these forty stones also ascendwith them out of the deep, havingalready received that seal?157  He answered, Becausethese Apostles and teachers, whopreached the name of the Son ofGod, dying after they had receivedhis faith and power, preached tothem who were dead before: andthey gave this seal to them.158  They went down thereforeinto the water with them, and againcame up. But these went downwhilst they were alive, and cameup again alive: whereas those whowere before dead, went down dead,but came up alive;159  Through these thereforethey received life, and knew theSon of God: for which cause theycame up with them, and were fitto come into the building of thetower; and were not cut, but putin entire; because they died inrighteousness, and in great purity;only this seal was wanting tothem.160  Thus you have the explicationof these things.161  I answered: Sir, tell menow what concerns those mountains;why are they so different, someof one form, and some of another?162 Hear, said he; These twelvemountains which thou seest, aretwelve nations, which make up thewhole world. Wherefore the Sonof God is preached to them, bythose whom he sent unto them.163  But why, said I, are theydifferent, and every one of a figure?He replied, Hearken. Those twelvenations which possess the wholeworld, are twelve people.164  And as thou hast beheldthese mountains different, so arethey. I will therefore open tothee the meaning and actions ofevery mountain.165  But first, sir, said I, showme this; Seeing these mountainsare so different, how have theyagreed in the building of thistower; and been brought to onecolour; and are no less brightthan those that came out of thedeep?166  Because, replied he, all thenations which are under heaven,have heard and believed in thesame one name of the Son of Godby whom they are called.167  Wherefore having receivedhis seal, they have all been madepartakers of the same understandingand knowledge; and their faithand charity have been the same;and they have carried the spiritsof these virgins together with hisname.168  And therefore the buildingof this tower appeared to be of thesame colour, and did shine likethe brightness of the sun.169  But after that they had thusagreed in one mind, there began tobe one body of them all; howbeitsome of them polluted themselves,and were cast off from those of therighteous, and again returned totheir former state, and becameeven worse than they were before.170  How, air, said I, werethey worse who knew the Lord?He answered: If he who knowsnot the Lord liveth wickedly,the punishment of his wickednessattends him;171 But he who has known theLord, ought to abstain altogetherfrom all wickedness, and more andmore to be the servant ofrighteousness.172 And does not he then seemto thee to sin more who ought tofollow goodness, if he shall preferthe part of sin; than he whooffends without knowing thepower of God?173 Wherefore these are indeedordained unto death; but they whohave known the Lord, and haveseen his wonderful works, if theyshall live wickedly, they shall bedoubly punished, and shall die forever.174  As therefore thou hast seenthat after the stones were cast outof the tower, which had been rejected,they were delivered to wicked andcruel spirits; and thou beheldestthe tower so cleansed, as if it hadall been made of one stone:175  So the church of God, whenit shall be purified: (the wickedand counterfeits, the mischievousand doubtful, and all that havebehaved themselves wickedly in it,and committed divers kinds of sin,being cast out) shall become onebody, and there shall be oneunderstanding, one opinion,one faith, and the same charity.176 And then shall the Son ofGod rejoice among them, and shallreceive his people with a pure will.177 And I said; Sir, all thesethings are great and honourable;but now show unto me the effectand force of every mountain: thatevery soul which trusteth in theLord, when it shall hear thesethings may honour his great, andwonderful, and holy name.178  Hear, said he, the varietyof these mountains, that is, of thetwelve nations.179  They who have believedof the first mountain, which isblack, are those who have revoltedfrom the faith, and spoken wickedthings against the Lord; andbetrayed the servants of God.180  These are condemned todeath; there is no repentance forthem: and therefore they areblack, because their kind iswicked.181  Of the second mountainwhich was smooth, are thehypocrites, who have believed,and the teachers of naughtiness:and these are next to the foregoing,which have not in them the fruit ofrighteousness.182  For as their mountain isbarren and without fruit so alsosuch kind of men have indeed thename of Christians, but are emptyof faith; nor is there any fruit ofthe truth in them.183  Nevertheless there is roomleft to them of repentance, if theyshall speedily pursue it; but ifthey shall delay, they also shallbe partakers of death with theforegoing kind.184  I said, air, why is thereroom left to those for repentance,and not to the foregoing kind,seeing their sins are well nigh thesame?185  There is therefore, said he,to these a return unto life byrepentance, because they have notblasphemed against their Lord,nor betrayed the servants of God:but by their desire of gain havedeceived men, leading them accordingto the lusts of sinners; whereforethey shall suffer for this thing.186  Howbeit there is still leftthem room for repentance, becausethey have not spoken any thingwickedly against the Lord.187  They who are of thethird mountain which had thornsand brambles, are those whobelieved, but were some of themrich; others taken up with manyaffairs: the brambles are theirriches; the thorns, those affairs inwhich they were engaged.188  Now they who are entangledin much business, and in diversityof affairs, join not themselves tothe servants of God, but wander,being called away by those affairswith which they are choked.189  And so they which are rich,with difficulty yield themselves tothe conversation of the servantsof God; fearing lest any thingshould be asked of them. Thesetherefore shall hardly enter thekingdom of God.190  For as men walk with difficultybare-foot over thorns, even sothese kind of men shall scarcelyenter into the kingdom of God.191  Nevertheless there is affordedto all these a return unto repentance,if they shall quickly return to it;because in their for-mer days theyhaving neglected to work, in the timethat is to come they may do some good.192  If therefore havingrepented they shall do the worksof righteousness, they shall live;but if they shall continue in theirevil courses, they shall be deliveredto those women who will take awaytheir lives.193  As for the fourth mountain,which had many herbs, the upperpart of which is green, butthe roots dry, and some of whichbeing touched with the heat of thesun, are withered;194  It denotes the doubtful, whohave believed, and some otherswho carry the Lord on their tongues,but have him not in their hearts:therefore their grass is dry,and without root; because theylive only in words, but theirworks are dead.195  These therefore are neitherdead nor living, and withal aredoubtful. For the doubtful areneither green nor dry; that isneither dead nor alive.196  For as the herbs dry awayat the sight of the sun, so thedoubtful, as soon as they hear ofpersecution, and fear inconveniencies,return to their idols, and againserve them, and are ashamedto bear the name of their Lord.197  This kind of men then isneither dead nor alive; neverthelessthese also may live, if they shallpresently repent; but if not,they shall be delivered to thosewomen, who shall take away theirlives.198  As concerning the fifthmountain that is craggy, and yethas green grass; they are of thiskind who have believed, and arefaithful indeed, but believe withdifficulty, and are bold and self-conceited; and would be thoughtto know all things, but reallyknow nothing.199  Wherefore, by reason ofthis confidence, knowledge isdeparted from them; and a rashpresumption is entered into them.200  But they carry themselveshigh, and as prudent men; andthough they are fools, yet wouldseem to be teachers.201  Now by reason of this follymany of them whilst they magnifythemselves, are become vain andempty. For boldness and vainconfidence is a very evil spirit.202  Wherefore many of theseare cast away; but othersacknowledging their error, haverepented, and submitted themselvesto those who are knowing.203  And to all the rest of thiskind, there is repentance allowed;forasmuch as they were not somuch wicked as foolish, and voidof understanding.204  If these therefore shallrepent, they shall live unto God;but if not, they shall dwell withthose women, who shall exercisetheir wickedness upon them.205  For what concerns thesixth mountain having greater andlesser clefts, they are such as havebelieved; but those in which werelesser clefts are they who have hadcontroversies among themselves;and by reason of their quarrelslanguish in the faith:206  Nevertheless many of thesehave repented, and so will the restwhen they shall hear my commands;for their controversies are butsmall, and they will easilyreturn unto repentance.207  But those who have thegreater clefts, will be as stiffstones, mindful of grudges andoffences, and full of anger amongthemselves. These therefore arecast from the tower, and refusedto be put into its building; forthis kind of men shall hardlylive.208  Our God and Lord, whoruleth over all things, and haspower over all his creatures, willnot remember our offences, but iseasily appeased by those whoconfess their sins: but man beinglanguid, mortal, infirm, and fullof sins, perseveres in his angeragainst man; as if it were in hispower to save or destroy him.209  But I, as the angel who amset over your repentance, admonishyou, that whosoever among you hasany such purpose he should lay itaside, and return unto repentance;and the Lord will heal your formersins, if you shall purge yourselffrom this evil spirit; but if youshall not do it, ye shall bedelivered to him unto death.210  As for the seventh mountainin which the grass was greenand flourishing, and the wholemountain faithful; and all kind ofcattle fed upon the grass of it, andthe more the grass was eaten, somuch the more it flourished;211  They are such as believed,and were always good and upright;and without any differences amongthemselves, but still rejoicedin the servants of God, havingput on the spirit of these virgins;and been always forward to showmercy to all men, readily givingto all men of their labourswithout upbraiding, and withoutdeliberation.212  Wherefore the Lord seeingtheir simplicity and innocence,has increased them in the works oftheir hands, and given them gracein all their works.213  But I, who am the angelappointed over your repentance,exhort you, that as many as are ofthis kind would continue in thesame purpose, that your seed maynot be rooted out for ever.214  For the Lord hath triedyou, and written you into ournumber; and all your seed shalldwell with the Son of God; for yeare all of his spirit.215  As concerning the eighthmountain in which were a greatmany springs, by which everykind of all the creatures of Godwas watered; they are such ashave believed the Apostles whichthe Lord sent into all the world topreach;216  And some of them beingteachers have preached and taughtpurely and sincerely, and havenot in the least yielded to any evil,desires, but have constantly walkedin righteousness and truth.217  These therefore have theirconversations among the angels.218  Again; as for what concernsthe ninth mountain which isa desert, and full of serpents; theyare such as have believed, but hadmany stains:219  These are such ministers asdischarge their ministry amiss;ravishing away the goods of thewidows and fatherless; and servethemselves, not others, out ofthose things which they havereceived.220 These, if they continue inthis covetousness, have deliveredthemselves unto death, nor shallthere be any hope of life for them.But if they shall be converted,and shall discharge their ministrysincerely, they may live.221  As for those which werefound rough, they are such ashave denied the name of the Lord,and not returned again to theLord, but have become savageand wild; not applying themelvesto the servants of God; but beingseparated from them, have for alittle carelessness lost their lives.222  For as a vine that is forsakenin a hedge, and never dressed,perishes and is choked by theweeds, and in time becomes wild,and ceases to be useful to its lord;so this kind of men despairing ofthemselves, and being soured,have begun to be unprofitable totheir Lord.223  Howbeit, to these there is,after all, repentance allowed, ifthey shall not be found from theirhearts to have denied Christ; butif any of these shall be found tohave denied him from his heart,I cannot tell whether such a onecan attain unto life.224  I say therefore that if anyone hath denied, he should inthese days return unto repentance;for it cannot be that anyonewho now denies the Lord, canafterwards attain unto salvationnevertheless repentance is promisedunto them who have formerly denied.225  But he who will repentmust hasten on his repentance,before the building of this toweris finished; otherwise, he shall bedelivered by those women untodeath.226  But they that are maimed,are the deceitful; and those whomix with one another, are theserpents that you saw mingled inthat mountain.227  For as the poison of serpentsis deadly unto men, so the wordsof such persons infect anddestroy men. They are thereforemaimed in their faith, by reasonof that kind of life which theylead.228  Howbeit some of them,having repented, have been saved;and so shall others of the samekind be also saved, if they shallrepent; but if not, they shall dieby those women who power andforce posses,229  For what concerns thetenth mountain, in which were thetrees covering the cattle, they aresuch as have believed; and someof them have been bishops, that is,governors of the churches.230  Others, are such stones ashave not feignedly, but with acheerful mind entertained theservants of God.231  Then, such as have been setover inferior ministries, and haveprotected the poor and the widows;and have always kept a chasteconversation: therefore theyalso are protected by the Lord.232  Whosoever shall do on thiswise, are honoured with the Lord;and their place is among theangels, if they shall continueto obey the Lord even unto the end.233  As to the eleventh mountainin which were trees loadedwith several sorts of fruit; theyare such as have believed, andsuffered death, for the name of theLord; and have endured with aheavy mind, and have given uptheir lives with all their hearts.234  And I said, Why then, sir,have all these fruit indeed, but yetsome fairer than others?235 Hearken, said he: Whosoeverhave suffered for the name ofthe Lord are esteemed honourableby the Lord; and all their offencesare blotted out, because they havesuffered death for the name of theSon of God.236  Hear now, why their fruitsare different, and some of themexcel others. They who werebrought before magistrates, andbeing asked, denied not the Lord,but suffered with a ready mind;these are more honourable withthe Lord. The fruits thereforethat are the most fair are these.237  But they who were fearfuland doubtful, and have deliberatedwith themselves whether theyshould confess or deny Christ, andyet have suffered; their fruits aresmaller, because that this thoughtcame into their hearts.238 For it is a wicked and evilthought for a servant to deliberatewhether he should deny his master:Take heed therefore ye whohave such thoughts, that this mindPontinrie not in you, and ye dieunto God.239 But ye who suffer death forhis name sake, ought to honourthe Lord, that he has esteemedyou worthy to bear his name; andthat you should be delivered fromall your sins.240  And why therefore do younot rather esteem yourselves happy?Ye think verily that if anyone among you suffer, he performsa great work! Yet the Lordgiveth you life, and ye understandit not.   For your offences didoppress you; and if you had notsuffered for his name sake, ye wouldnow be dead unto the Lord.241  Wherefore I speak this untoyou who deliberate whether yeshould confess or deny him. Confessthat ye have the Lord for yourGod, lest at any time denying him,ye be delivered up into bonds.242  For if all nations punishtheir servants which deny theirmasters; what think you that theLord will do unto you, who hasthe power of all things?243  Remove therefore out ofyour hearts these doubts, that yemay live for ever unto God.244  As for the twelfth mountain,which was white, they aresuch as have believed like sincerechildren, into whose thoughtsthere never came any malice, norhave they ever known what sinwas, but have always continued intheir integrity.245  Wherefore this kind of menshall without all doubt inherit thekingdom of God; because theyhave never in any thing defiledthe commandments of God, buthave continued with sincerity inthe same condition all the days oftheir lives.246 Whosoever therefore, saidhe, shall continue as childrenwithout malice; shall be morehonourable than all those of whomI have yet spoken: for all suchchildren are honoured by theLord, and esteemed the first ofall.247 Happy therefore are yewho shall remove all malice fromyou, and put on innocence; be.cause ye shall first see the Lord.248 And after he had thusended his explication of all themountains, I said unto him, Sir,show me now also what concernsthe stones that were brought outof the plain, and put into thetower in the room of those thatwere rejected.249  As also concerning thoseround stones which were addedinto the building of the tower;and also of those who stillcontinued round.250  Hear now, says he,concerning those stones which werebrought out of the plain into thebuilding of the tower, and placedin the room of those that wererejected: they are the roots ofthat white mountain.251  Wherefore because thosewho have believed of that mountain,were very innocent; the lord ofthis tower commanded that theywhich were of the roots of thismountain should be placed intothe building.252  For he knew that if theywere put into, this building theywould continue bright; nor wouldany of them any more be madeblack.253  But if he had added afterthis manner, from the rest of themountains, he would almost haveneeded again to visit the tower,and to cleanse it.254  Now all these white stonesare the young men who have believed,or shall believe; for they are allof the same kind.   Happy is thiskind, because it is innocent.255  Hear now also concerningthose round and bright stones; allthese are of this white mountain.But they are therefore foundround, because their riches havea little darkened them from thetruth, and dazzled their eyes.256  Howbeit they have neverdeparted from the Lord, nor hasany wicked word proceeded outof their mouths; but allrighteousness, and virtue,and truth.257 When therefore the Lordsaw their minds, and that theymight adorn the truth; hecommanded that they should continuegood, and that their riches shouldbe pared away:258  For he would not havethem taken wholly away, to theend they might do some goodwith that which was left, and liveunto God; because they also areof a good kind.259  Therefore was there littlecut off from them, and so theywere put into the building of thistower.260  As for the rest whichcontinued still round, and werenot found fit for the building ofthis tower, because they have notyet received the seal; they werecarried back to their place, be.cause they were found veryround.261  But this present world mustbe cut away from them, and thevanities of their riches; and thenthey will be fit for the kingdom ofGod. For they must enter intothe kingdom of God, because Godhas blessed this innocent kind.262 Of this kind therefore noneshall fall away: for though any ofthem being tempted by the devilshould offend, he shall soon returnto his Lord God.263  I the angel of repentanceesteem you happy, whosoever areinnocent as little children, becauseyour portion is good and honourablewith the Lord.264  And I say unto all youwho have received this seal; keepsimplicity, and remember not theoffences which are  committedagainst you, nor continue inmalice, or in bitterness, throughthe memory of offences.265  But become one spirit,and provide remedies for theseevil rents, and remove them fromyou; that the lord of the sheepmay rejoice at it; for he willrejoice, if he shall find all whole.266  But if any of these sheepshall be found scattered away, Woeshall be to the shepherds; andif the shepherds themselves shallbe scattered; what will they answerto the lord of the sheep-fold?Will they say that they weretroubled by the sheep? Butthey shall not be believed.267  For it is an incredible thingthat the shepherd should suffer byhis flock; and he shall be the morepunished for his life.268 Now I am the shepherd;and especially must give anaccount of you.269  Wherefore take care ofyourselves whilst the tower is,yet building. The Lord dwellsin those that love peace, for peaceis beloved; but he is far off fromthe contentious, and those who arefull of malice.270 Wherefore restore unto himthe Spirit entire, as ye received it.For if thou shalt give unto afuller a garment new and whole,thou wilt expect to receive it wholeagain; if therefore the fuller shallrestore it unto thee torn, wouldstthou receive it?271 Wouldst thou not presentlybe angry, and reproach him,saying: I gave my garment to theewhole, why halt thou rent it, andmade it useless to me? Now it isof no use to me, by reason of therent which thou hast made in it.Wouldst thou not say all this to afuller, for the rent which he madein thy garment?272 If therefore thou wouldstbe concerned for thy garment,and complain that thou hadst notreceived it whole; what thinkestthou that the Lord will do, whogave his Spirit to thee entire, andthou hast rendered him altogetherunprofitable, so that he can be ofno use unto his Lord? For beingcorrupted by thee, he is no longerprofitable to him.273 Will not therefore the Lorddo the same concerning his Spirit,by reason of thy deed? Undoubtedly,said I, he will do the sameto all those whom he shall find tocontinue in the remembrance ofinjuries.274 Tread not then under foothe said, his mercy; but ratherhonour him, because he is sopatient with respect to your offences,and not like one of you; but repent,for it will be profitable for you.275  All these things whichare above written, I the shepherdand angel of repentance, haveshown and spoken to the servantsof God.276 If therefore ye shall believeand hearken to these words, andshall walk in them and correctyour ways, ye shall live. But ifye shall, continue in malice, andin the remembrance of injuries,no such sinners shall live untoGod.277 All these things which wereto be spoken by me, I have thusdelivered unto you. Then theshepherd said unto me, Hast thouasked all things of me?I answered, sir, I have.278  Why then, said he, hastthou not asked concerning thespaces of these stones that wereput in the building, that I mayexplain that also unto thee?I answered, sir, I forgot it.Hear, then, said he, concerningthese also.279  They are those who havenow heard these commands, andhave repented with all theirhearts;280 And when the Lord sawthat their repentance was goodand pure, and that they couldcontinue in it, he commandedtheir former sins to be blottedout. For these spaces were theirsins, and they are therefore madeeven that they might not appear.SIMILITUDE X.Of Repentance and alms-deeds.AFTER I had written thisbook, the angel which haddelivered me to that shepherd,came into the house where I wasand sat upon the bed, and thatshepherd stood at his right hand.2  Then he called me and saidunto me; I delivered thee andthy house to this shepherd, thatthou mightest be protected byhim. I said, Yes, Lord.3  If therefore, said he, thouwilt be protected from allvexations and from all cruelty, andhave success in every good wordand work, and have all virtue andrighteousness; walk in thosecommands which he has given thee,and thou shalt have dominionover all sin.4  For if thou keepest thosecommands, all the lust and pleasureof this present world shall besubject to thee; and success shallfollow thee in every good undertaking.5  Take therefore his gravityand modesty towards thee, andsay unto all, that he is in greathonour and renown with God, andis a prince of great authority, andpowerful in his office.6  To him only is the power ofrepentance committed throughoutthe whole world. Does he notseem to thee to be of greatauthority?7  But ye despise his goodness,and the modesty which he showstowards you.8  I said unto him; Sir, askhim since the time that he cameinto my house whether I havedone any thing disorderly, orhave offended him in any thing?9  I know, said he, that thouhast done nothing disorderly,neither wilt thou hereafter doany such thing, and therefore Ispeak these things with thee thatthen mayest persevere; for hehas given me a good accountconcerning thee.10  But thou shalt speak thesethings to others, that they whoeither have repented, or shallrepent, may be like-minded withthee, and he may give me asgood an account of them also;and that I may do the same untothe Lord.11 I answered; Sir, I declareto all men the wonderful works ofGod; and I hope that all wholove them, and have before sinned,when they shall hear these things,will repent, and recover life.12 Continue therefore, said he,in this ministry, and fulfil it.And whosoever shall do accordingto the commands of this shepherd,he shall live; and shall have greathonour both here and with theLord.13  But they that shall not keephis commands, flee from their life,and are adversaries to it. Andthey that follow not his commands,shall deliver themselvesunto death; and shall be everyone guilty of his own blood.14  But I say unto thee, keepthese commandments, and thoushalt find a cure for all thy sins.15  Moreover, I have sentthese virgins to dwell with thee;for I have seen that they are verykind to thee. Thou shalt thereforehave them for thy helpers,that thou mayest the better keepthe commands which he hath giventhee; for these commands cannotbe kept without these virgins.16  And as I see how they arewilling to be with thee, I willalso command them that they shallnot all depart from thy house.17  Only do thou purify thyhouse; for they will readily dwellin a clean house. For they areclean and chaste, and industrious;and all of them have grace withthe Lord.18  If therefore thou shalt havethy house pure, they will abidewith thee. But, if it shall benever so little polluted, they willimmediately depart from thy house;for these virgins cannot endure anymanner of pollution.19  I said unto him; Sir, I hopethat I shall so please them, thatthey shall always delight to dwellin my house. And as be to whomyou have committed me, makesno complaint of me; so neithershall they complain.20  Then he said to that shepherd:I see that the servant of God willlive and keep these commandments,and place these virgins in a purehabitation.21 When he had said this,he delivered me again to thatshepherd, and called the virgins,and said unto them; Forasmuch as Isee that ye will readily dwell inthis man's house, I commend himand his family to you, that ye maynot at all depart from his house.And they willingly heard thesewords.22  Then he said unto me,Go on manfully in thy ministry;declare to all men the great thingsof God, and thou shalt find gracein this ministry.23  And whosover shall walkin these commands, shall live,and be happy in his life. But hethat shall neglect them, shall notlive, and shall be unhappy in hislife.24  Say unto all that whosoevercan do well, cease not to exercisethemselves in good works, for itis profitable unto them. For Iwould that all men should bedelivered from the inconveniencesthey lie under.25  For he that wants, andsuffers inconveniences in hisdaily life, is in great tormentand necessity. Whosoever thereforedelivers such a soul from necessity,gets great joy unto himself.26  For he that is grieved withsuch inconveniencies is equallytormented, as if he were in chains.And many upon the account ofsuch calamities, being not able tobear them, have chosen even todestroy themselves.27  He therefore that knows thecalamity of such a man, and doesnot free him from it, commits agreat sin, and is guilty of hisblood.28  Wherefore exercise your.selves in good works, as many ashave received ability from theLord; lest whilst ye delay to dothem, the building of the tower befinished; because for your sakesthe building is stopped.29  Except therefore ye shallmake haste to do well, the towershall be finished, and ye shall beshut out of it.30  And after he had thus spokenwith me, he rose up from the bedand departed, taking the shepherdand virgins with him.31  Howbeit he said unto me,that he would send back theshepherd and virgins untomy house.  Amen.                       REFERENCES TO THE BOOK OF                         HERMAS, THE SHEPHERD.     [This book, divided into three parts, called his VISIONS, COMMANDS,     and SIMILITUDES, is thus entitled, because it was composed by     Hermas, brother to Pius, bishop of Rome; and because the Angel, who     bears the principal part in it, is represented in the form and habit     of a shepherd. Irenxus quotes it under the very name of Scripture.     Origen thought it a most useful writing, and that it was divinely     inspired; Eusebius says that, though it was not esteemed canonical,     it was read publicly in the churches, which is corroborated by     Jerome; and Athanasius cites it, calls it a most useful work, and     observes, that though it was not strictly canonical, the Fathers     appointed it to be read for direction and confirmation in faith and     piety. Jerome, notwithstanding this, and that he applauded it in his     catalogue of writers, in his comments upon it afterwards, terms it     apocryphal and foolish.  Turtullian praised it when a Catholic, and     abused it when a Montanist. Although Gelasius ranks it among the     apocryphal books, it is found attached to some of the most ancient     MSS. of the New Testament; and Archbishop Wake, believing it the     genuine work of an apostolical Father, preserves it to the English     reader by the foregoing translation, in which he has rendered the     three parts of it not only more exact, but in greater purity than     they had before appeared. The archbishop procured Dr. Grabe to     entirely collate the old Latin version with an ancient MS. in the     Lambeth library; and the learned prelate himself still further     improved the whole from a multitude of fragments of the original     Greek never before used for that purpose.]*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FORBIDDEN GOSPELS, BY WAKE, V9 ************ This file should be named fb09w11.txt or fb09w11.zip **********Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, fb09w12.txtVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, fb09w11a.txtThis eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the USunless a copyright notice is included.

propagation of the species.Brief history of the subject.Object of the experiments, and the manner in which they were tried.Statistical value of the measurements.The experiments carried on during several successive generations.Nature of the relationship of the plants in the later generations.Uniformity of the conditions to which the plants were subjected.Some apparent and some real causes of error.Amount of pollen employed.Arrangement of the work.Importance of the conclusions.There is weighty and abundant evidence that the flowers of most kinds ofplants are constructed so as to be occasionally or habituallycross-fertilised by pollen from another flower, produced either by thesame plant, or generally, as we shall hereafter see reason to believe,by a distinct plant. Cross-fertilisation is sometimes ensured by thesexes being separated, and in a large number of cases by the pollen andstigma of the same flower being matured at different times. Such plantsare called dichogamous, and have been divided into two sub-classes:proterandrous species, in which the pollen is mature before the stigma,and proterogynous species, in which the reverse occurs; this latter formof dichogamy not being nearly so common as the other.Cross-fertilisation is also ensured, in many cases, by mechanicalcontrivances of wonderful beauty, preventing the impregnation of theflowers by their own pollen. There is a small class of plants, which Ihave called dimorphic and trimorphic, but to which Hildebrand has giventhe more appropriate name of heterostyled; this class consists of plantspresenting two or three distinct forms, adapted for reciprocalfertilisation, so that, like plants with separate sexes, they can hardlyfail to be intercrossed in each generation. The male and female organsof some flowers are irritable, and the insects which touch them getdusted with pollen, which is thus transported to other flowers. Again,there is a class, in which the ovules absolutely refuse to be fertilisedby pollen from the same plant, but can be fertilised by pollen from anyother individual of the same species. There are also very many specieswhich are partially sterile with their own pollen. Lastly, there is alarge class in which the flowers present no apparent obstacle of anykind to self-fertilisation, nevertheless these plants are frequentlyintercrossed, owing to the prepotency of pollen from another individualor variety over the plant's own pollen.As plants are adapted by such diversified and effective means forcross-fertilisation, it might have been inferred from this fact alonethat they derived some great advantage from the process; and it is theobject of the present work to show the nature and importance of thebenefits thus derived. There are, however, some exceptions to the ruleof plants being constructed so as to allow of or to favourcross-fertilisation, for some few plants seem to be invariablyself-fertilised; yet even these retain traces of having been formerlyadapted for cross-fertilisation. These exceptions need not make us doubtthe truth of the above rule, any more than the existence of some fewplants which produce flowers, and yet never set seed, should make usdoubt that flowers are adapted for the production of seed and thepropagation of the species.We should always keep in mind the obvious fact that the production ofseed is the chief end of the act of fertilisation; and that this end canbe gained by hermaphrodite plants with incomparably greater certainty byself-fertilisation, than by the union of the sexual elements belongingto two distinct flowers or plants. Yet it is as unmistakably plain thatinnumerable flowers are adapted for cross-fertilisation, as that theteeth and talons of a carnivorous animal are adapted for catching prey;or that the plumes, wings, and hooks of a seed are adapted for itsdissemination. Flowers, therefore, are constructed so as to gain twoobjects which are, to a certain extent, antagonistic, and this explainsmany apparent anomalies in their structure. The close proximity of theanthers to the stigma in a multitude of species favours, and oftenleads, to self-fertilisation; but this end could have been gained farmore safely if the flowers had been completely closed, for then thepollen would not have been injured by the rain or devoured by insects,as often happens. Moreover, in this case, a very small quantity ofpollen would have been sufficient for fertilisation, instead of millionsof grains being produced. But the openness of the flower and theproduction of a great and apparently wasteful amount of pollen arenecessary for cross-fertilisation. These remarks are well illustrated bythe plants called cleistogene, which bear on the same stock two kinds offlowers. The flowers of the one kind are minute and completely closed,so that they cannot possibly be crossed; but they are abundantlyfertile, although producing an extremely small quantity of pollen. Theflowers of the other kind produce much pollen and are open; and thesecan be, and often are, cross-fertilised. Hermann Muller has also madethe remarkable discovery that there are some plants which exist undertwo forms; that is, produce on distinct stocks two kinds ofhermaphrodite flowers. The one form bears small flowers constructed forself-fertilisation; whilst the other bears larger and much moreconspicuous flowers plainly constructed for cross-fertilisation by theaid of insects; and without their aid these produce no seed.The adaptation of flowers for cross-fertilisation is a subject which hasinterested me for the last thirty-seven years, and I have collected alarge mass of observations, but these are now rendered superfluous bythe many excellent works which have been lately published. In the year1857 I wrote a short paper on the fertilisation of the kidney bean (1/1.'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and 1858 pages 824 and 844. 'Annalsand Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.);and in 1862 my work 'On the Contrivances by which British and ForeignOrchids are Fertilised by Insects' appeared. It seemed to me a betterplan to work out one group of plants as carefully as I could, ratherthan to publish many miscellaneous and imperfect observations. Mypresent work is the complement of that on Orchids, in which it was shownhow admirably these plants are constructed so as to permit of, or tofavour, or to necessitate cross-fertilisation. The adaptations forcross-fertilisation are perhaps more obvious in the Orchideae than inany other group of plants, but it is an error to speak of them, as someauthors have done, as an exceptional case. The lever-like action of thestamens of Salvia (described by Hildebrand, Dr. W. Ogle, and others), bywhich the anthers are depressed and rubbed on the backs of bees, showsas perfect a structure as can be found in any orchid. Papilionaceousflowers, as described by various authors--for instance, by Mr. T.H.Farrer--offer innumerable curious adaptations for cross-fertilisation.The case of Posoqueria fragrans (one of the Rubiaceae), is as wonderfulas that of the most wonderful orchid. The stamens, according to FritzMuller, are irritable, so that as soon as a moth visits a flower, theanthers explode and cover the insect with pollen; one of the filamentswhich is broader than the others then moves and closes the flower forabout twelve hours, after which time it resumes its original position.(1/2. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1866 page 129.) Thus the stigma cannot befertilised by pollen from the same flower, but only by that brought by amoth from some other flower. Endless other beautiful contrivances forthis same purpose could be specified.Long before I had attended to the fertilisation of flowers, a remarkablebook appeared in 1793 in Germany, 'Das Entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur,'by C.K. Sprengel, in which he clearly proved by innumerableobservations, how essential a part insects play in the fertilisation ofmany plants. But he was in advance of his age, and his discoveries werefor a long time neglected. Since the appearance of my book on Orchids,many excellent works on the fertilisation of flowers, such as those byHildebrand, Delpino, Axell and Hermann Muller, and numerous shorterpapers, have been published. (1/3. Sir John Lubbock has given aninteresting summary of the whole subject in his 'British Wild Flowersconsidered in relation to Insects' 1875. Hermann Muller's work 'DieBefruchtung der Blumen durch Insekten' 1873, contains an immense numberof original observations and generalisations. It is, moreover,invaluable as a repertory with references to almost everything which hasbeen published on the subject. His work differs from that of all othersin specifying what kinds of insects, as far as known, visit the flowersof each species. He likewise enters on new ground, by showing not onlythat flowers are adapted for their own good to the visits of certaininsects; but that the insects themselves are excellently adapted forprocuring nectar or pollen from certain flowers. The value of H.Muller's work can hardly be over-estimated, and it is much to be desiredthat it should be translated into English. Severin Axell's work iswritten in Swedish, so that I have not been able to read it.) A listwould occupy several pages, and this is not the proper place to givetheir titles, as we are not here concerned with the means, but with theresults of cross-fertilisation. No one who feels interest in themechanism by which nature effects her ends, can read these books andmemoirs without the most lively interest.From my own observations on plants, guided to a certain extent by theexperience of the breeders of animals, I became convinced many years agothat it is a general law of nature that flowers are adapted to becrossed, at least occasionally, by pollen from a distinct plant.Sprengel at times foresaw this law, but only partially, for it does notappear that he was aware that there was any difference in power betweenpollen from the same plant and from a distinct plant. In theintroduction to his book (page 4) he says, as the sexes are separated inso many flowers, and as so many other flowers are dichogamous, "itappears that nature has not willed that any one flower should befertilised by its own pollen." Nevertheless, he was far from keepingthis conclusion always before his mind, or he did not see its fullimportance, as may be perceived by anyone who will read his observationscarefully; and he consequently mistook the meaning of variousstructures. But his discoveries are so numerous and his work soexcellent, that he can well afford to bear a small amount of blame. Amost capable judge, H. Muller, likewise says: "It is remarkable in howvery many cases Sprengel rightly perceived that pollen is necessarilytransported to the stigmas of other flowers of the same species by theinsects which visit them, and yet did not imagine that thistransportation was of any service to the plants themselves." (1/4. 'DieBefruchtung der Blumen' 1873 page 4. His words are: "Es ist merkwurdig,in wie zahlreichen Fallen Sprengel richtig erkannte, dass durch dieBesuchenden Insekten der Bluthenstaub mit Nothwendigkeit auf die Narbenanderer Bluthen derselben Art ubertragen wird, ohne auf die Vermuthungzu kommen, dass in dieser Wirkung der Nutzen des Insektenbesuches furdie Pflanzen selbst gesucht werden musse.")Andrew Knight saw the truth much more clearly, for he remarks, "Natureintended that a sexual intercourse should take place betweenneighbouring plants of the same species." (1/5. 'PhilosophicalTransactions' 1799 page 202.) After alluding to the various means bywhich pollen is transported from flower to flower, as far as was thenimperfectly known, he adds, "Nature has something more in view than thatits own proper males would fecundate each blossom." In 1811 Kolreuterplainly hinted at the same law, as did afterwards another famoushybridiser of plants, Herbert. (1/6. Kolreuter 'Mem. de l'Acad. de St.Petersbourg' tome 3 1809 published 1811 page 197. After showing how wellthe Malvaceae are adapted for cross-fertilisation, he asks, "An idaliquid in recessu habeat, quod hujuscemodi flores nunquam proprio suopulvere, sed semper eo aliarum suae speciei impregnentur, meritoquaeritur? Certe natura nil facit frustra." Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae,with a Treatise on Cross-bred Vegetables' 1837.) But none of thesedistinguished observers appear to have been sufficiently impressed withthe truth and generality of the law, so as to insist on it and impresstheir beliefs on others.In 1862 I summed up my observations on Orchids by saying that nature"abhors perpetual self-fertilisation." If the word perpetual had beenomitted, the aphorism would have been false. As it stands, I believethat it is true, though perhaps rather too strongly expressed; and Ishould have added the self-evident proposition that the propagation ofthe species, whether by self-fertilisation or by cross-fertilisation, orasexually by buds, stolons, etc. is of paramount importance. HermannMuller has done excellent service by insisting repeatedly on this latterpoint.It often occurred to me that it would be advisable to try whetherseedlings from cross-fertilised flowers were in any way superior tothose from self-fertilised flowers. But as no instance was known withanimals of any evil appearing in a single generation from the closestpossible interbreeding, that is between brothers and sisters, I thoughtthat the same rule would hold good with plants; and that it would benecessary at the sacrifice of too much time to self-fertilise andintercross plants during several successive generations, in order toarrive at any result. I ought to have reflected that such elaborateprovisions favouring cross-fertilisation, as we see in innumerableplants, would not have been acquired for the sake of gaining a distantand slight advantage, or of avoiding a distant and slight evil.Moreover, the fertilisation of a flower by its own pollen corresponds toa closer form of interbreeding than is possible with ordinary bi-sexualanimals; so that an earlier result might have been expected.I was at last led to make the experiments recorded in the present volumefrom the following circumstance. For the sake of determining certainpoints with respect to inheritance, and without any thought of theeffects of close interbreeding, I raised close together two large bedsof self-fertilised and crossed seedlings from the same plant of Linariavulgaris. To my surprise, the crossed plants when fully grown wereplainly taller and more vigorous than the self-fertilised ones. Beesincessantly visit the flowers of this Linaria and carry pollen from oneto the other; and if insects are excluded, the flowers produce extremelyfew seeds; so that the wild plants from which my seedlings were raisedmust have been intercrossed during all previous generations. It seemedtherefore quite incredible that the difference between the two beds ofseedlings could have been due to a single act of self-fertilisation; andI attributed the result to the self-fertilised seeds not having beenwell ripened, improbable as it was that all should have been in thisstate, or to some other accidental and inexplicable cause. During thenext year, I raised for the same purpose as before two large beds closetogether of self-fertilised and crossed seedlings from the carnation,Dianthus caryophyllus. This plant, like the Linaria, is almost sterileif insects are excluded; and we may draw the same inference as before,namely, that the parent-plants must have been intercrossed during everyor almost every previous generation. Nevertheless, the self-fertilisedseedlings were plainly inferior in height and vigour to the crossed.My attention was now thoroughly aroused, for I could hardly doubt thatthe difference between the two beds was due to the one set being theoffspring of crossed, and the other of self-fertilised flowers.Accordingly I selected almost by hazard two other plants, which happenedto be in flower in the greenhouse, namely, Mimulus luteus and Ipomoeapurpurea, both of which, unlike the Linaria and Dianthus, are highlyself-fertile if insects are excluded. Some flowers on a single plant ofboth species were fertilised with their own pollen, and others werecrossed with pollen from a distinct individual; both plants beingprotected by a net from insects. The crossed and self-fertilised seedsthus produced were sown on opposite sides of the same pots, and treatedin all respects alike; and the plants when fully grown were measured andcompared. With both species, as in the cases of the Linaria andDianthus, the crossed seedlings were conspicuously superior in heightand in other ways to the self-fertilised. I therefore determined tobegin a long series of experiments with various plants, and these werecontinued for the following eleven years; and we shall see that in alarge majority of cases the crossed beat the self-fertilised plants.Several of the exceptional cases, moreover, in which the crossed plantswere not victorious, can be explained.It should be observed that I have spoken for the sake of brevity, andshall continue to do so, of crossed and self-fertilised seeds,seedlings, or plants; these terms implying that they are the product ofcrossed or self-fertilised flowers. Cross-fertilisation always means across between distinct plants which were raised from seeds and not fromcuttings or buds. Self-fertilisation always implies that the flowers inquestion were impregnated with their own pollen.My experiments were tried in the following manner. A single plant, if itproduced a sufficiency of flowers, or two or three plants were placedunder a net stretched on a frame, and large enough to cover the plant(together with the pot, when one was used) without touching it. Thislatter point is important, for if the flowers touch the net they may becross-fertilised by bees, as I have known to happen; and when the net iswet the pollen may be injured. I used at first "white cotton net," withvery fine meshes, but afterwards a kind of net with meshes one-tenth ofan inch in diameter; and this I found by experience effectually excludedall insects excepting Thrips, which no net will exclude. On the plantsthus protected several flowers were marked, and were fertilised withtheir own pollen; and an equal number on the same plants, marked in adifferent manner, were at the same time crossed with pollen from adistinct plant. The crossed flowers were never castrated, in order tomake the experiments as like as possible to what occurs under naturewith plants fertilised by the aid of insects. Therefore, some of theflowers which were crossed may have failed to be thus fertilised, andafterwards have been self-fertilised. But this and some other sources oferror will presently be discussed. In some few cases of spontaneouslyself-fertile species, the flowers were allowed to fertilise themselvesunder the net; and in still fewer cases uncovered plants were allowed tobe freely crossed by the insects which incessantly visited them. Thereare some great advantages and some disadvantages in my havingoccasionally varied my method of proceeding; but when there was anydifference in the treatment, it is always so stated under the head ofeach species.Care was taken that the seeds were thoroughly ripened before beinggathered. Afterwards the crossed and self-fertilised seeds were in mostcases placed on damp sand on opposite sides of a glass tumbler coveredby a glass plate, with a partition between the two lots; and the glasswas placed on the chimney-piece in a warm room. I could thus observe thegermination of the seeds. Sometimes a few would germinate on one sidebefore any on the other, and these were thrown away. But as often as apair germinated at the same time, they were planted on opposite sides ofa pot, with a superficial partition between the two; and I thusproceeded until from half-a-dozen to a score or more seedlings ofexactly the same age were planted on the opposite sides of several pots.If one of the young seedlings became sickly or was in any way injured,it was pulled up and thrown away, as well as its antagonist on theopposite side of the same pot.As a large number of seeds were placed on the sand to germinate, manyremained after the pairs had been selected, some of which were in astate of germination and others not so; and these were sown crowdedtogether on the opposite sides of one or two rather larger pots, orsometimes in two long rows out of doors. In these cases there was themost severe struggle for life among the crossed seedlings on one side ofthe pot, and the self-fertilised seedlings on the other side, andbetween the two lots which grew in competition in the same pot. A vastnumber soon perished, and the tallest of the survivors on both sideswhen fully grown were measured. Plants treated in this manner, weresubjected to nearly the same conditions as those growing in a state ofnature, which have to struggle to maturity in the midst of a host ofcompetitors.On other occasions, from the want of time, the seeds, instead of beingallowed to germinate on damp sand, were sown on the opposite sides ofpots, and the fully grown plants measured. But this plan is lessaccurate, as the seeds sometimes germinated more quickly on one sidethan on the other. It was however necessary to act in this manner withsome few species, as certain kinds of seeds would not germinate wellwhen exposed to the light; though the glasses containing them were kepton the chimney-piece on one side of a room, and some way from the twowindows which faced the north-east.

This occurred in the plainestmanner with the seeds of Papaver vagum and Delphinium consolida, andless plainly with those of Adonis aestivalis and Ononis minutissima.Rarely more than one or two of the seeds of these four speciesgerminated on the bare sand, though left there for some weeks; but whenthese same seeds were placed on earth in pots, and covered with a thinlayer of sand, they germinated immediately in large numbers.)The soil in the pots in which the seedlings were planted, or the seedssown, was well mixed, so as to be uniform in composition. The plants onthe two sides were always watered at the same time and as equally aspossible; and even if this had not been done, the water would havespread almost equally to both sides, as the pots were not large. Thecrossed and self-fertilised plants were separated by a superficialpartition, which was always kept directed towards the chief source ofthe light, so that the plants on both sides were equally illuminated. Ido not believe it possible that two sets of plants could have beensubjected to more closely similar conditions, than were my crossed andself-fertilised seedlings, as grown in the above described manner.In comparing the two sets, the eye alone was never trusted. Generallythe height of every plant on both sides was carefully measured, oftenmore than once, namely, whilst young, sometimes again when older, andfinally when fully or almost fully grown. But in some cases, which arealways specified, owing to the want of time, only one or two of thetallest plants on each side were measured. This plan, which is not agood one, was never followed (except with the crowded plants raised fromthe seeds remaining after the pairs had been planted) unless the tallestplants on each side seemed fairly to represent the average differencebetween those on both sides. It has, however, some great advantages, assickly or accidentally injured plants, or the offspring of ill-ripenedseeds, are thus eliminated. When the tallest plants alone on each sidewere measured, their average height of course exceeds that of all theplants on the same side taken together. But in the case of the muchcrowded plants raised from the remaining seeds, the average height ofthe tallest plants was less than that of the plants in pairs, owing tothe unfavourable conditions to which they were subjected from beinggreatly crowded. For our purpose, however, of the comparison of thecrossed and self-fertilised plants, their absolute height signifieslittle.As the plants were measured by an ordinary English standard divided intoinches and eighths of an inch, I have not thought it worth while tochange the fractions into decimals. The average or mean heights werecalculated in the ordinary rough method by adding up the measurements ofall, and dividing the product by the number of plants measured; theresult being here given in inches and decimals. As the different speciesgrow to various heights, I have always for the sake of easy comparisongiven in addition the average height of the crossed plants of eachspecies taken as 100, and have calculated the average height of theself-fertilised plant in relation to this standard. With respect to thecrowded plants raised from the seeds remaining after the pairs had beenplanted, and of which only some of the tallest on each side weremeasured, I have not thought it worth while to complicate the results bygiving separate averages for them and for the pairs, but have added upall their heights, and thus obtained a single average.I long doubted whether it was worth while to give the measurements ofeach separate plant, but have decided to do so, in order that it may beseen that the superiority of the crossed plants over theself-fertilised, does not commonly depend on the presence of two orthree extra fine plants on the one side, or of a few very poor plants onthe other side. Although several observers have insisted in generalterms on the offspring from intercrossed varieties being superior toeither parent-form, no precise measurements have been given (1/8. Asummary of these statements, with references, may be found in my'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 17 2ndedition 1875 volume 2 page 109.); and I have met with no observations onthe effects of crossing and self-fertilising the individuals of the samevariety. Moreover, experiments of this kind require so much time--minehaving been continued during eleven years--that they are not likely soonto be repeated.As only a moderate number of crossed and self-fertilised plants weremeasured, it was of great importance to me to learn how far the averageswere trustworthy. I therefore asked Mr. Galton, who has had muchexperience in statistical researches, to examine some of my tables ofmeasurements, seven in number, namely, those of Ipomoea, Digitalis,Reseda lutea, Viola, Limnanthes, Petunia, and Zea. I may premise that ifwe took by chance a dozen or score of men belonging to two nations andmeasured them, it would I presume be very rash to form any judgment fromsuch small numbers on their average heights. But the case is somewhatdifferent with my crossed and self-fertilised plants, as they were ofexactly the same age, were subjected from first to last to the sameconditions, and were descended from the same parents. When only from twoto six pairs of plants were measured, the results are manifestly oflittle or no value, except in so far as they confirm and are confirmedby experiments made on a larger scale with other species. I will nowgive the report on the seven tables of measurements, which Mr. Galtonhas had the great kindness to draw up for me.["I have examined the measurements of the plants with care, and by manystatistical methods, to find out how far the means of the several setsrepresent constant realities, such as would come out the same so long asthe general conditions of growth remained unaltered. The principalmethods that were adopted are easily explained by selecting one of theshorter series of plants, say of Zea mays, for an example."TABLE 1/1. Zea mays (young plants).

But as soon as we arrange them the in order of theirmagnitudes, as in columns 4 and 5, the case is materially altered. Wenow see, with few exceptions, that the largest plant on the crossed sidein each pot exceeds the largest plant on the self-fertilised side, thatthe second exceeds the second, the third the third, and so on. Out ofthe fifteen cases in the table, there are only two exceptions to thisrule. We may therefore confidently affirm that a crossed series willalways be found to exceed a self-fertilised series, within the range ofthe conditions under which the present experiment has been made."TABLE 1/2.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed.Column 3: Self-fertilised.Column 4: Difference.Pot 1 : 18 7/8 : 19 2/8 : +0 3/8.Pot 2 : 20 7/8 : 19     : -1 7/8.Pot 3 : 21 1/8 : 16 7/8 : -4 2/8.Pot 4 : 19 6/8 : 16     : -3 6/8."Next as regards the numerical estimate of this excess. The mean valuesof the several groups are so discordant, as is shown in Table 1/2, thata fairly precise numerical estimate seems impossible. But theconsideration arises, whether the difference between pot and pot may notbe of much the same order of importance as that of the other conditionsupon which the growth of the plants has been modified. If so, and onlyon that condition, it would follow that when all the measurements,either of the crossed or the self-fertilised plants, were combined intoa single series, that series would be statistically regular. Theexperiment is tried in Table 1/1, columns 7 and 8, where the regularityis abundantly clear, and justifies us in considering its mean asperfectly reliable. I have protracted these measurements, and revisedthem in the usual way, by drawing a curve through them with a free hand,but the revision barely modifies the means derived from the originalobservations. In the present, and in nearly all the other cases, thedifference between the original and revised means is under 2 per cent oftheir value. It is a very remarkable coincidence that in the seven kindsof plants, whose measurements I have examined, the ratio between theheights of the crossed and of the self-fertilised ranges in five caseswithin very narrow limits. In Zea mays it is as 100 to 84, and in theothers it ranges between 100 to 76 and 100 to 86.""The determination of the variability (measured by what is technicallycalled the 'probable error') is a problem of more delicacy than that ofdetermining the means, and I doubt, after making many trials, whether itis possible to derive useful conclusions from these few observations. Weought to have measurements of at least fifty plants in each case, inorder to be in a position to deduce fair results. One fact, however,bearing on variability, is very evident in most cases, though not in Zeamays, namely, that the self-fertilised plants include the larger numberof exceptionally small specimens, while the crossed are more generallyfull grown.""Those groups of cases in which measurements have been made of a few ofthe tallest plants that grew in rows, each of which contained amultitude of plants, show very clearly that the crossed plants exceedthe self-fertilised in height, but they do not tell by inferenceanything about their respective mean values. If it should happen that aseries is known to follow the law of error or any other law, and if thenumber of individuals in the series is known, it would be alwayspossible to reconstruct the whole series when a fragment of it has beengiven. But I find no such method to be applicable in the present case.The doubt as to the number of plants in each row is of minor importance;the real difficulty lies in our ignorance of the precise law followed bythe series. The experience of the plants in pots does not help us todetermine that law, because the observations of such plants are too fewto enable us to lay down more than the middle terms of the series towhich they belong with any sort of accuracy, whereas the cases we arenow considering refer to one of its extremities. There are other specialdifficulties which need not be gone into, as the one already mentionedis a complete bar."]Mr. Galton sent me at the same time graphical representations which hehad made of the measurements, and they evidently form fairly regularcurves. He appends the words "very good" to those of Zea and Limnanthes.He also calculated the average height of the crossed and self-fertilisedplants in the seven tables by a more correct method than that followedby me, namely, by including the heights, as estimated in accordance withstatistical rules, of a few plants which died before they were measured;whereas I merely added up the heights of the survivors, and divided thesum by their number. The difference in our results is in one way highlysatisfactory, for the average heights of the self-fertilised plants, asdeduced by Mr. Galton, is less than mine in all the cases excepting one,in which our averages are the same; and this shows that I have by nomeans exaggerated the superiority of the crossed over theself-fertilised plants.After the heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants had beentaken, they were sometimes cut down close to the ground, and an equalnumber of both weighed. This method of comparison gives very strikingresults, and I wish that it had been oftener followed. Finally a recordwas often kept of any marked difference in the rate of germination ofthe crossed and self-fertilised seeds,--of the relative periods offlowering of the plants raised from them,--and of their productiveness,that is, of the number of seed-capsules which they produced and of theaverage number of seeds which each capsule contained.When I began my experiments I did not intend to raise crossed andself-fertilised plants for more than a single generation; but as soon asthe plants of the first generation were in flower I thought that I wouldraise one more generation, and acted in the following manner. Severalflowers on one or more of the self-fertilised plants were againself-fertilised; and several flowers on one or more of the crossedplants were fertilised with pollen from another crossed plant of thesame lot. Having thus once begun, the same method was followed for asmany as ten successive generations with some of the species. The seedsand seedlings were always treated in exactly the same manner as alreadydescribed. The self-fertilised plants, whether originally descended fromone or two mother-plants, were thus in each generation as closelyinterbred as was possible; and I could not have improved on my plan. Butinstead of crossing one of the crossed plants with another crossedplant, I ought to have crossed the self-fertilised plants of eachgeneration with pollen taken from a non-related plant--that is, onebelonging to a distinct family or stock of the same species and variety.This was done in several cases as an additional experiment, and gavevery striking results. But the plan usually followed was to put intocompetition and compare intercrossed plants, which were almost alwaysthe offspring of more or less closely related plants, with theself-fertilised plants of each succeeding generation;--all having beengrown under closely similar conditions. I have, however, learnt more bythis method of proceeding, which was begun by an oversight and thennecessarily followed, than if I had always crossed the self-fertilisedplants of each succeeding generation with pollen from a fresh stock.I have said that the crossed plants of the successive generations werealmost always inter-related. When the flowers on an hermaphrodite plantare crossed with pollen taken from a distinct plant, the seedlings thusraised may be considered as hermaphrodite brothers or sisters; thoseraised from the same capsule being as close as twins or animals of thesame litter. But in one sense the flowers on the same plant are distinctindividuals, and as several flowers on the mother-plant were crossed bypollen taken from several flowers on the father-plant, such seedlingswould be in one sense half-brothers or sisters, but more closely relatedthan are the half-brothers and sisters of ordinary animals. The flowerson the mother-plant were, however, commonly crossed by pollen taken fromtwo or more distinct plants; and in these cases the seedlings might becalled with more truth half-brothers or sisters. When two or threemother-plants were crossed, as often happened, by pollen taken from twoor three father-plants (the seeds being all intermingled), some of theseedlings of the first generation would be in no way related, whilstmany others would be whole or half-brothers and sisters. In the secondgeneration a large number of the seedlings would be what may be calledwhole or half first-cousins, mingled with whole and half-brothers andsisters, and with some plants not at all related. So it would be in thesucceeding generations, but there would also be many cousins of thesecond and more remote degrees. The relationship will thus have becomemore and more inextricably complex in the later generations; with mostof the plants in some degree and many of them closely related.I have only one other point to notice, but this is one of the highestimportance; namely, that the crossed and self-fertilised plants weresubjected in the same generation to as nearly similar and uniformconditions as was possible. In the successive generations they wereexposed to slightly different conditions as the seasons varied, and theywere raised at different periods. But in other respects all were treatedalike, being grown in pots in the same artificially prepared soil, beingwatered at the same time, and kept close together in the same greenhouseor hothouse. They were therefore not exposed during successive years tosuch great vicissitudes of climate as are plants growing out of doors.ON SOME APPARENT AND REAL CAUSES OF ERROR IN MY EXPERIMENTS.It has been objected to such experiments as mine, that covering plantswith a net, although only for a short time whilst in flower, may affecttheir health and fertility. I have seen no such effect except in oneinstance with a Myosotis, and the covering may not then have been thereal cause of injury. But even if the net were slightly injurious, andcertainly it was not so in any high degree, as I could judge by theappearance of the plants and by comparing their fertility with that ofneighbouring uncovered plants, it would not have vitiated myexperiments; for in all the more important cases the flowers werecrossed as well as self-fertilised under a net, so that they weretreated in this respect exactly alike.As it is impossible to exclude such minute pollen-carrying insects asThrips, flowers which it was intended to fertilise with their own pollenmay sometimes have been afterwards crossed with pollen brought by theseinsects from another flower on the same plant; but as we shall hereaftersee, a cross of this kind does not produce any effect, or at most only aslight one. When two or more plants were placed near one another underthe same net, as was often done, there is some real though not greatdanger of the flowers which were believed to be self-fertilised beingafterwards crossed with pollen brought by Thrips from a distinct plant.I have said that the danger is not great because I have often found thatplants which are self-sterile, unless aided by insects, remained sterilewhen several plants of the same species were placed under the same net.If, however, the flowers which had been presumably self-fertilised by mewere in any case afterwards crossed by Thrips with pollen brought from adistinct plant, crossed seedlings would have been included amongst theself-fertilised; but it should be especially observed that thisoccurrence would tend to diminish and not to increase any superiority inaverage height, fertility, etc., of the crossed over the self-fertilisedplants.As the flowers which were crossed were never castrated, it is probableor even almost certain that I sometimes failed to cross-fertilise themeffectually, and that they were afterwards spontaneouslyself-fertilised. This would have been most likely to occur withdichogamous species, for without much care it is not easy to perceivewhether their stigmas are ready to be fertilised when the anthers open.But in all cases, as the flowers were protected from wind, rain, and theaccess of insects, any pollen placed by me on the stigmatic surfacewhilst it was immature, would generally have remained there until thestigma was mature; and the flowers would then have been crossed as wasintended. Nevertheless, it is highly probable that self-fertilisedseedlings have sometimes by this means got included amongst the crossedseedlings. The effect would be, as in the former case, not to exaggeratebut to diminish any average superiority of the crossed over theself-fertilised plants.Errors arising from the two causes just named, and from others,--such assome of the seeds not having been thoroughly ripened, though care wastaken to avoid this error--the sickness or unperceived injury of any ofthe plants,--will have been to a large extent eliminated, in those casesin which many crossed and self-fertilised plants were measured and anaverage struck. Some of these causes of error will also have beeneliminated by the seeds having been allowed to germinate on bare dampsand, and being planted in pairs; for it is not likely that ill-maturedand well-matured, or diseased and healthy seeds, would germinate atexactly the same time. The same result will have been gained in theseveral cases in which only a few of the tallest, finest, and healthiestplants on each side of the pots were measured.Kolreuter and Gartner have proved that with some plants several, even asmany as from fifty to sixty, pollen-grains are necessary for thefertilisation of all the ovules in the ovarium. (1/9. 'Kentniss derBefruchtung' 1844 page 345. Naudin 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1page 27.) Naudin also found in the case of Mirabilis that if only one ortwo of its very large pollen-grains were placed on the stigma, theplants raised from such seeds were dwarfed. I was therefore careful togive an amply sufficient supply of pollen, and generally covered thestigma with it; but I did not take any special pains to place exactlythe same amount on the stigmas of the self-fertilised and crossedflowers. After having acted in this manner during two seasons, Iremembered that Gartner thought, though without any direct evidence,that an excess of pollen was perhaps injurious; and it has been provedby Spallanzani, Quatrefages, and Newport, that with various animals anexcess of the seminal fluid entirely prevents fertilisation. (1/10.'Transactions of the Philosophical Society' 1853 pages 253-258.) It wastherefore necessary to ascertain whether the fertility of the flowerswas affected by applying a rather small and an extremely large quantityof pollen to the stigma. Accordingly a very small mass of pollen-grainswas placed on one side of the large stigma in sixty-four flowers ofIpomoea purpurea, and a great mass of pollen over the whole surface ofthe stigma in sixty-four other flowers. In order to vary the experiment,half the flowers of both lots were on plants produced fromself-fertilised seeds, and the other half on plants from crossed seeds.The sixty-four flowers with an excess of pollen yielded sixty-onecapsules; and excluding four capsules, each of which contained only asingle poor seed, the remainder contained on an average 5.07 seeds percapsule. The sixty-four flowers with only a little pollen placed on oneside of the stigma yielded sixty-three capsules, and excluding one fromthe same cause as before, the remainder contained on an average 5.129seeds. So that the flowers fertilised with little pollen yielded rathermore capsules and seeds than did those fertilised with an excess; butthe difference is too slight to be of any significance. On the otherhand, the seeds produced by the flowers with an excess of pollen were alittle heavier of the two; for 170 of them weighed 79.67 grains, whilst170 seeds from the flowers with very little pollen weighed 79.20 grains.Both lots of seeds having been placed on damp sand presented nodifference in their rate of germination. We may therefore conclude thatmy experiments were not affected by any slight difference in the amountof pollen used; a sufficiency having been employed in all cases.The order in which our subject will be treated in the present volume isas follows. A long series of experiments will first be given in Chapters2 to 6. Tables will afterwards be appended, showing in a condensed formthe relative heights, weights, and fertility of the offspring of thevarious crossed and self-fertilised species. Another table exhibits thestriking results from fertilising plants, which during severalgenerations had either been self-fertilised or had been crossed withplants kept all the time under closely similar conditions, with pollentaken from plants of a distinct stock and which had been exposed todifferent conditions. In the concluding chapters various related pointsand questions of general interest will be discussed.Anyone not specially interested in the subject need not attempt to readall the details (marked []); though they possess, I think, some value,and cannot be all summarised. But I would suggest to the reader to takeas an example the experiments on Ipomoea in Chapter 2; to which may beadded those on Digitalis, Origanum, Viola, or the common cabbage, as inall these cases the crossed plants are superior to the self-fertilisedin a marked degree, but not in quite the same manner. As instances ofself-fertilised plants being equal or superior to the crossed, theexperiments on Bartonia, Canna, and the common pea ought to be read; butin the last case, and probably in that of Canna, the want of anysuperiority in the crossed plants can be explained.Species were selected for experiment belonging to widely distinctfamilies, inhabiting various countries. In some few cases several generabelonging to the same family were tried, and these are grouped together;but the families themselves have been arranged not in any natural order,but in that which was the most convenient for my purpose. Theexperiments have been fully given, as the results appear to me ofsufficient value to justify the details. Plants bearing hermaphroditeflowers can be interbred more closely than is possible with bisexualanimals, and are therefore well-fitted to throw light on the nature andextent of the good effects of crossing, and on the evil effects of closeinterbreeding or self-fertilisation. The most important conclusion atwhich I have arrived is that the mere act of crossing by itself does nogood. The good depends on the individuals which are crossed differingslightly in constitution, owing to their progenitors having beensubjected during several generations to slightly different conditions,or to what we call in our ignorance spontaneous variation. Thisconclusion, as we shall hereafter see, is closely connected with variousimportant physiological problems, such as the benefit derived fromslight changes in the conditions of life, and this stands in the closestconnection with life itself. It throws light on the origin of the twosexes and on their separation or union in the same individual, andlastly on the whole subject of hybridism, which is one of the greatestobstacles to the general acceptance and progress of the great principleof evolution.In order to avoid misapprehension, I beg leave to repeat that throughoutthis volume a crossed plant, seedling, or seed, means one of crossedPARENTAGE, that is, one derived from a flower fertilised with pollenfrom a distinct plant of the same species. And that a self-fertilisedplant, seedling, or seed, means one of self-fertilised PARENTAGE, thatis, one derived from a flower fertilised with pollen from the sameflower, or sometimes, when thus stated, from another flower on the sameplant.CHAPTER II.CONVOLVULACEAE.Ipomoea purpurea, comparison of the height and fertility of the crossedand self-fertilised plants during ten successive generations.Greater constitutional vigour of the crossed plants.The effects on the offspring of crossing different flowers on the sameplant, instead of crossing distinct individuals.The effects of a cross with a fresh stock.The descendants of the self-fertilised plant named Hero.Summary on the growth, vigour, and fertility of the successive crossedand self-fertilised generations.Small amount of pollen in the anthers of the self-fertilised plants ofthe later generations, and the sterility of their first-producedflowers.Uniform colour of the flowers produced by the self-fertilised plants.The advantage from a cross between two distinct plants depends on theirdiffering in constitution.A plant of Ipomoea purpurea, or as it is often called in England theconvolvulus major, a native of South America, grew in my greenhouse. Tenflowers on this plant were fertilised with pollen from the same flower;and ten other flowers on the same plant were crossed with pollen from adistinct plant. The fertilisation of the flowers with their own pollenwas superfluous, as this convolvulus is highly self-fertile; but I actedin this manner to make the experiments correspond in all respects.Whilst the flowers are young the stigma projects beyond the anthers; andit might have been thought that it could not be fertilised without theaid of humble-bees, which often visit the flowers; but as the flowergrows older the stamens increase in length, and their anthers brushagainst the stigma, which thus receives some pollen. The number of seedsproduced by the crossed and self-fertilised flowers differed verylittle.[Crossed and self-fertilised seeds obtained in the above manner wereallowed to germinate on damp sand, and as often as pairs germinated atthe same time they were planted in the manner described in theIntroduction (Chapter 1), on the opposite sides of two pots. Five pairswere thus planted; and all the remaining seeds, whether or not in astate of germination, were planted on the opposite sides of a third pot,so that the young plants on both sides were here greatly crowded andexposed to very severe competition. Rods of iron or wood of equaldiameter were given to all the plants to twine up; and as soon as one ofeach pair reached the summit both were measured. A single rod was placedon each side of the crowded pot, Number 3, and only the tallest plant oneach side was measured.TABLE 2/1. Ipomoea purpurea (First Generation.).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Seedlings from Crossed Plants.Column 3: Seedlings from Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  87 4/8 :  69.Pot 1 :  87 4/8 :  66.Pot 1 :  89     :  73.Pot 2 :  88     :  68 4/8.Pot 2 :  87     :  60 4/8.Pot 3 :  77     :  57.Plants crowded; the tallest one measured on each side.Total : 516     : 394.The average height of the six crossed plants is here 86 inches, whilstthat of the six self-fertilised plants is only 65.66 inches, so that thecrossed plants are to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 76. Itshould be observed that this difference is not due to a few of thecrossed plants being extremely tall, or to a few of the self-fertilisedbeing extremely short, but to all the crossed plants attaining a greaterheight than their antagonists. The three pairs in Pot 1 were measured attwo earlier periods, and the difference was sometimes greater andsometimes less than that at the final measuring. But it is aninteresting fact, of which I have seen several other instances, that oneof the self-fertilised plants, when nearly a foot in height, was half aninch taller than the crossed plant; and again, when two feet high, itwas 1 3/8 of an inch taller, but during the ten subsequent days thecrossed plant began to gain on its antagonist, and ever afterwardasserted its supremacy, until it exceeded its self-fertilised opponentby 16 inches.The five crossed plants in Pots 1 and 2 were covered with a net, andproduced 121 capsules; the five self-fertilised plants producedeighty-four capsules, so that the numbers of capsules were as 100 to 69.Of the 121 capsules on the crossed plants sixty-five were the product offlowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant, and these containedon an average 5.23 seeds per capsule; the remaining fifty-six capsuleswere spontaneously self-fertilised. Of the eighty-four capsules on theself-fertilised plants, all the product of renewed self-fertilisation,fifty-five (which were alone examined) contained on an average 4.85seeds per capsule. Therefore the cross-fertilised capsules, comparedwith the self-fertilised capsules, yielded seeds in the proportion of100 to 93. The crossed seeds were relatively heavier than theself-fertilised seeds. Combining the above data (i.e., number ofcapsules and average number of contained seeds), the crossed plants,compared with the self-fertilised, yielded seeds in the ratio of 100 to64.These crossed plants produced, as already stated, fifty-sixspontaneously self-fertilised capsules, and the self-fertilised plantsproduced twenty-nine such capsules. The former contained on an average,in comparison with the latter, seeds in the proportion of 100 to 99.In Pot 3, on the opposite sides of which a large number of crossed andself-fertilised seeds had been sown and the seedlings allowed tostruggle together, the crossed plants had at first no great advantage.At one time the tallest crossed was 25 1/8 inches high, and the tallestself-fertilised plants 21 3/8. But the difference afterwards became muchgreater. The plants on both sides, from being so crowded, were poorspecimens. The flowers were allowed to fertilise themselvesspontaneously under a net; the crossed plants produced thirty-sevencapsules, the self-fertilised plants only eighteen, or as 100 to 47. Theformer contained on an average 3.62 seeds per capsule; and the latter3.38 seeds, or as 100 to 93. Combining these data (i.e., number ofcapsules and average number of seeds), the crowded crossed plantsproduced seeds compared with the self-fertilised as 100 to 45. Theselatter seeds, however, were decidedly heavier, a hundred weighing 41.64grains, than those from the capsules on the crossed plants, of which ahundred weighed 36.79 grains; and this probably was due to the fewercapsules borne by the self-fertilised plants having been betternourished. We thus see that the crossed plants in this the firstgeneration, when grown under favourable conditions, and when grown underunfavourable conditions from being much crowded, greatly exceeded inheight, and in the number of capsules produced, and slightly in thenumber of seeds per capsule, the self-fertilised plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.Flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation (Table 2/1) werecrossed by pollen from distinct plants of the same generation; andflowers on the self-fertilised plants were fertilised by pollen from thesame flower. The seeds thus produced were treated in every respect asbefore, and we have in Table 2/2 the result.TABLE 2/2. Ipomoea purpurea (Second Generation.).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  87     :  67 4/8.Pot 1 :  83     :  68 4/8.Pot 1 :  83     :  80 4/8.Pot 2 :  85 4/8 :  61 4/8.Pot 2 :  89     :  79.Pot 2 :  77 4/8 :  41.Total : 505     : 398.Here again every single crossed plant is taller than its antagonist. Theself-fertilised plant in Pot 1, which ultimately reached the unusualheight of 80 4/8 inches, was for a long time taller than the opposedcrossed plant, though at last beaten by it. The average height of thesix crossed plants is 84.16 inches, whilst that of the sixself-fertilised plants is 66.33 inches, or as 100 to 79.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE THIRD GENERATION.Seeds from the crossed plants of the last generation (Table 2/2) againcrossed, and from the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised, weretreated in all respects exactly as before, with the following result:--TABLE 2/3. Ipomoea purpurea (Third Generation.).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  74     :  56 4/8.Pot 1 :  72     :  51 4/8.Pot 1 :  73 4/8 :  54.Pot 2 :  82     :  59.Pot 2 :  81     :  30.Pot 2 :  82     :  66.Total : 464.5   : 317.Again all the crossed plants are higher than their antagonists: theiraverage height is 77.41 inches, whereas that of the self-fertilised is52.83 inches, or as 100 to 68.I attended closely to the fertility of the plants of this thirdgeneration. Thirty flowers on the crossed plants were crossed withpollen from other crossed plants of the same generation, and thetwenty-six capsules thus produced contained, on an average, 4.73 seeds;whilst thirty flowers on the self-fertilised plants, fertilised with thepollen from the same flower, produced twenty-three capsules, eachcontaining 4.43 seeds. Thus the average number of seeds in the crossedcapsules was to that in the self-fertilised capsules as 100 to 94. Ahundred of the crossed seeds weighed 43.27 grains, whilst a hundred ofthe self-fertilised seeds weighed only 37.63 grains. Many of theselighter self-fertilised seeds placed on damp sand germinated before thecrossed; thus thirty-six of the former germinated whilst only thirteenof the latter or crossed seeds germinated. In Pot 1 the three crossedplants produced spontaneously under the net (besides the twenty-sixartificially cross-fertilised capsules) seventy-seven self-fertilisedcapsules containing on an average 4.41 seeds; whilst the threeself-fertilised plants produced spontaneously (besides the twenty-threeartificially self-fertilised capsules) only twenty-nine self-fertilisedcapsules, containing on an average 4.14 seeds. Therefore the averagenumber of seeds in the two lots of spontaneously self-fertilisedcapsules was as 100 to 94. Taking into consideration the number ofcapsules together with the average number of seeds, the crossed plants(spontaneously self-fertilised) produced seeds in comparison with theself-fertilised plants (spontaneously self-fertilised) in the proportionof 100 to 35. By whatever method the fertility of these plants iscompared, the crossed are more fertile than the self-fertilised plants.I tried in several ways the comparative vigour and powers of growth ofthe crossed and self-fertilised plants of this third generation. Thus,four self-fertilised seeds which had just germinated were planted on oneside of a pot, and after an interval of forty-eight hours, four crossedseeds in the same state of germination were planted on the oppositeside; and the pot was kept in the hothouse. I thought that the advantagethus given to the self-fertilised seedlings would have been so greatthat they would never have been beaten by the crossed ones. They werenot beaten until all had grown to a height of 18 inches; and the degreeto which they were finally beaten is shown in Table 2/4. We here seethat the average height of the four crossed plants is 76.62, and of thefour self-fertilised plants 65.87 inches, or as 100 to 86; thereforeless than when both sides started fair.TABLE 2/4. Ipomoea purpurea (Third Generation, the self-fertilisedplants having had a start of forty-eight hours).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 3 :  78 4/8 :  73 4/8.Pot 3 :  77 4/8 :  53.Pot 3 :  73     :  61 4/8.Pot 3 :  77 4/8 :  75 4/8.Total : 306.5   : 263.5.Crossed and self-fertilised seeds of the third generation were also sownout of doors late in the summer, and therefore under unfavourableconditions, and a single stick was given to each lot of plants to twineup. The two lots were sufficiently separate so as not to interfere witheach other's growth, and the ground was clear of weeds. As soon as theywere killed by the first frost (and there was no difference in theirhardiness), the two tallest crossed plants were found to be 24.5 and22.5 inches, whilst the two tallest self-fertilised plants were only 15and 12.5 inches in height, or as 100 to 59.I likewise sowed at the same time two lots of the same seeds in a partof the garden which was shady and covered with weeds. The crossedseedlings from the first looked the most healthy, but they twined up astick only to a height of 7 1/4 inches; whilst the self-fertilised werenot able to twine at all; and the tallest of them was only 3 1/2 inchesin height.Lastly, two lots of the same seeds were sown in the midst of a bed ofcandy-tuft (Iberis) growing vigorously. The seedlings came up, but allthe self-fertilised ones soon died excepting one, which never twined andgrew to a height of only 4 inches. Many of the crossed seedlings, on theother hand, survived; and some twined up the stems of the Iberis to theheight of 11 inches. These cases prove that the crossed seedlings havean immense advantage over the self-fertilised, both when growingisolated under very unfavourable conditions, and when put intocompetition with each other or with other plants, as would happen in astate of nature.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FOURTH GENERATION.Seedlings raised as before from the crossed and self-fertilised plantsof the third generation in Table 2/3, gave results as follows:--TABLE 2/5. Ipomoea purpurea (Fourth Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  84       :  80.Pot 1 :  47       :  44 1/2.Pot 2 :  83       :  73 1/2.Pot 2 :  59       :  51 1/2.Pot 3 :  82       :  56 1/2.Pot 3 :  65 1/2   :  63.Pot 3 :  68       :  52.Total : 488.5     : 421.0.Here the average height of the seven crossed plants is 69.78 inches, andthat of the seven self-fertilised plants 60.14; or as 100 to 86. Thissmaller difference relatively to that in the former generations, may beattributed to the plants having been raised during the depth of winter,and consequently to their not having grown vigorously, as was shown bytheir general appearance and from several of them never reaching thesummits of the rods. In Pot 2, one of the self-fertilised plants was fora long time taller by two inches than its opponent, but was ultimatelybeaten by it, so that all the crossed plants exceeded their opponents inheight. Of twenty-eight capsules produced by the crossed plantsfertilised by pollen from a distinct plant, each contained on an average4.75 seeds; of twenty-seven self-fertilised capsules on theself-fertilised plants, each contained on an average 4.47 seeds; so thatthe proportion of seeds in the crossed and self-fertilised capsules wasas 100 to 94.Some of the same seeds, from which the plants in Table 2/5 had beenraised, were planted, after they had germinated on damp sand, in asquare tub, in which a large Brugmansia had long been growing. The soilwas extremely poor and full of roots; six crossed seeds were planted inone corner, and six self-fertilised seeds in the opposite corner. Allthe seedlings from the latter soon died excepting one, and this grew tothe height of only 1 1/2 inches. Of the crossed plants three survived,and they grew to the height of 2 1/2 inches, but were not able to twineround a stick; nevertheless, to my surprise, they produced some smallmiserable flowers. The crossed plants thus had a decided advantage overthe self-fertilised plants under this extremity of bad conditions.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FIFTH GENERATION.These were raised in the same manner as before, and when measured gavethe following results:--TABLE 2/6. Ipomoea purpurea (Fifth Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  96        :  73.Pot 1 :  86        :  78.Pot 1 :  69        :  29.Pot 2 :  84        :  51.Pot 2 :  84        :  84.Pot 2 :  76 1/4    :  59.Total : 495.25     : 374.00.The average height of the six crossed plants is 82.54 inches, and thatof the six self-fertilised plants 62.33 inches, or as 100 to 75. Everycrossed plant exceeded its antagonist in height. In Pot 1 the middleplant on the crossed side was slightly injured whilst young by a blow,and was for a time beaten by its opponent, but ultimately recovered theusual superiority. The crossed plants produced spontaneously a vastnumber more capsules than did the self-fertilised plants; and thecapsules of the former contained on an average 3.37 seeds, whilst thoseof the latter contained only 3.0 per capsule, or as 100 to 89. Butlooking only to the artificially fertilised capsules, those on thecrossed plants again crossed contained on an average 4.46 seeds, whilstthose on the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised contained 4.77seeds; so that the self-fertilised capsules were the more fertile of thetwo, and of this unusual fact I can offer no explanation.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SIXTH GENERATION.These were raised in the usual manner, with the following result. Ishould state that there were originally eight plants on each side; butas two of the self-fertilised became extremely unhealthy and never grewto near their full height, these as well as their opponents have beenstruck out of the list. If they had been retained, they would have madethe average height of the crossed plants unfairly greater than that ofthe self-fertilised. I have acted in the same manner in a few otherinstances, when one of a pair plainly became very unhealthy.TABLE 2/7.  Ipomoea purpurea (Sixth Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  93     :  50 1/2.Pot 1 :  91     :  65.Pot 2 :  79     :  50.Pot 2 :  86 1/2 :  87.Pot 2 :  88     :  62.Pot 3 :  87 1/2 :  64 1/2.Total : 525     : 379.The average height of the six crossed plants is here 87.5, and of thesix self-fertilised plants 63.16, or as 100 to 72. This large differencewas chiefly due to most of the plants, especially the self-fertilisedones, having become unhealthy towards the close of their growth, andthey were severely attacked by aphides. From this cause nothing can beinferred with respect to their relative fertility. In this generation wehave the first instance of a self-fertilised plant in Pot 2 exceeding(though only by half an inch) its crossed opponent. This victory wasfairly won after a long struggle. At first the self-fertilised plant wasseveral inches taller than its opponent, but when the latter was 4 1/2feet high it had grown equal; it then grew a little taller than theself-fertilised plant, but was ultimately beaten by it to the extent ofhalf an inch, as shown in Table 2/7. I was so much surprised at thiscase that I saved the self-fertilised seeds of this plant, which I willcall the "Hero," and experimented on its descendants, as will hereafterbe described.Besides the plants included in Table 2/7, nine crossed and nineself-fertilised plants of the same lot were raised in two other pots, 4and 5. These pots had been kept in the hothouse, but from want of roomwere, whilst the plants were young, suddenly moved during very coldweather into the coldest part of the greenhouse. They all sufferedgreatly, and never quite recovered. After a fortnight only two of thenine self-fertilised seedlings were alive, whilst seven of the crossedsurvived. The tallest of these latter plants when measured was 47 inchesin height, whilst the tallest of the two surviving self-fertilisedplants was only 32 inches. Here again we see how much more vigorous thecrossed plants are than the self-fertilised.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SEVENTH GENERATION.These were raised as heretofore with the following result:--TABLE 2/8. Ipomoea purpurea (Seventh Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  84 4/8    :  74 6/8.Pot 1 :  84 6/8    :  84.Pot 1 :  76 2/8    :  55 4/8.Pot 2 :  84 4/8    :  65.Pot 2 :  90        :  51 2/8.Pot 2 :  82 2/8    :  80 4/8.Pot 3 :  83        :  67 6/8.Pot 3 :  86        :  60 2/8.Pot 4 :  84 2/8    :  75 2/8.Total : 755.50     : 614.25.Each of these nine crossed plants is higher than its opponent, though inone case only by three-quarters of an inch. Their average height is83.94 inches, and that of the self-fertilised plants 68.25, or as 100 to81. These plants, after growing to their full height, became veryunhealthy and infested with aphides, just when the seeds were setting,so that many of the capsules failed, and nothing can be said on theirrelative fertility.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE EIGHTH GENERATION.As just stated, the plants of the last generation, from which thepresent ones were raised, were very unhealthy and their seeds ofunusually small size; and this probably accounts for the two lotsbehaving differently to what they did in any of the previous orsucceeding generations. Many of the self-fertilised seeds germinatedbefore the crossed ones, and these were of course rejected. When thecrossed seedlings in Table 2/9 had grown to a height of between 1 and 2feet, they were all, or almost all, shorter than their self-fertilisedopponents, but were not then measured. When they had acquired an averageheight of 32.28 inches, that of the self-fertilised plants was 40.68, oras 100 to 122. Moreover, every one of the self-fertilised plants, with asingle exception, exceeded its crossed opponent. When, however, thecrossed plants had grown to an average height of 77.56 inches, they justexceeded (namely, by .7 of an inch) the average height of theself-fertilised plants; but two of the latter were still taller thantheir crossed opponents. I was so much astonished at this whole case,that I tied string to the summits of the rods; the plants being thusallowed to continue climbing upwards. When their growth was completethey were untwined, stretched straight, and measured. The crossed plantshad now almost regained their accustomed superiority, as may be seen inTable 2/9.The average height of the eight crossed plants is here 113.25 inches,and that of the self-fertilised plants 96.65, or as 100 to 85.Nevertheless two of the self-fertilised plants, as may be seen in Table2/9, were still higher than their crossed opponents. The lattermanifestly had much thicker stems and many more lateral branches, andlooked altogether more vigorous than the self-fertilised plants, andgenerally flowered before them. The earlier flowers produced by theseself-fertilised plants did not set any capsules, and their antherscontained only a small amount of pollen; but to this subject I shallreturn. Nevertheless capsules produced by two other self-fertilisedplants of the same lot, not included in Table 2/9, which had been highlyfavoured by being grown in separate pots, contained the large averagenumber of 5.1 seeds per capsule.TABLE 2/9. Ipomoea purpurea (Eighth Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 : 111 6/8 :  96.Pot 1 : 127     :  54.Pot 1 : 130 6/8 :  93 4/8.Pot 2 :  97 2/8 :  94.Pot 2 :  89 4/8 : 125 6/8.Pot 3 : 103 6/8 : 115 4/8.Pot 3 : 100 6/8 :   84 6/8.Pot 3 : 147 4/8 : 109 6/8.Total : 908.25  : 773.25.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE NINTH GENERATION.The plants of this generation were raised in the same manner as before,with the result shown in Table 2/10.The fourteen crossed plants average in height 81.39 inches and thefourteen self-fertilised plants 64.07, or as 100 to 79. Oneself-fertilised plant in Pot 3 exceeded, and one in Pot 4 equalled inheight, its opponent. The self-fertilised plants showed no sign ofinheriting the precocious growth of their parents; this having been due,as it would appear, to the abnormal state of the seeds from theunhealthiness of their parents. The fourteen self-fertilised plantsyielded only forty spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, to which mustbe added seven, the product of ten flowers artificially self-fertilised.On the other hand, the fourteen crossed plants yielded 152 spontaneouslyself-fertilised capsules; but thirty-six flowers on these plants werecrossed (yielding thirty-three capsules), and these flowers wouldprobably have produced about thirty spontaneously self-fertilisedcapsules. Therefore an equal number of the crossed and self-fertilisedplants would have produced capsules in the proportion of about 182 to47, or as 100 to 26. Another phenomenon was well pronounced in thisgeneration, but I believe had occurred previously to a slight extent;namely, that most of the flowers on the self-fertilised plants weresomewhat monstrous. The monstrosity consisted in the corolla beingirregularly split so that it did not open properly, with one or two ofthe stamens slightly foliaceous, coloured, and firmly coherent to thecorolla. I observed this monstrosity in only one flower on the crossedplants. The self-fertilised plants, if well nourished, would almostcertainly, in a few more generations, have produced double flowers, forthey had already become in some degree sterile. (2/1. See on thissubject 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 182nd edition volume 2 page 152.)TABLE 2/10.

As one of the crossed plants inPot 1 in Table 2/11 became much diseased, having crumpled leaves, andproducing hardly any capsules, it and its opponent have been struck outof the table.TABLE 2/11. Ipomoea purpurea (Tenth Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 :  92 3/8   :  47 2/8.Pot 1 :  94 4/8   :  34 6/8.Pot 2 :  87       :  54 4/8.Pot 2 :  89 5/8   :  49 2/8.Pot 2 : 105       :  66 2/8.Total : 468.5     : 252.0.The five crossed plants average 93.7 inches, and the fiveself-fertilised only 50.4, or as 100 to 54. This difference, however, isso great that it must be looked at as in part accidental. The sixcrossed plants (the diseased one here included) yielded spontaneously101 capsules, and the six self-fertilised plants 88, the latter beingchiefly produced by one of the plants. But as the diseased plant, whichyielded hardly any seed, is here included, the ratio of 101 to 88 doesnot fairly give the relative fertility of the two lots. The stems of thesix crossed plants looked so much finer than those of the sixself-fertilised plants, that after the capsules had been gathered andmost of the leaves had fallen off, they were weighed. Those of thecrossed plants weighed 2,693 grains, whilst those of the self-fertilisedplants weighed only 1,173 grains, or as 100 to 44; but as the diseasedand dwarfed crossed plant is here included, the superiority of theformer in weight was really greater.]THE EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING OF CROSSING DIFFERENT FLOWERS ON THE SAMEPLANT, INSTEAD OF CROSSING DISTINCT INDIVIDUALS.In all the foregoing experiments, seedlings from flowers crossed bypollen from a distinct plant (though in the later generations more orless closely related) were put into competition with, and almostinvariably proved markedly superior in height to the offspring fromself-fertilised flowers. I wished, therefore, to ascertain whether across between two flowers on the same plant would give to the offspringany superiority over the offspring from flowers fertilised with theirown pollen. I procured some fresh seed and raised two plants, which werecovered with a net; and several of their flowers were crossed withpollen from a distinct flower on the same plant. Twenty-nine capsulesthus produced contained on an average 4.86 seeds per capsule; and 100 ofthese seeds weighed 36.77 grains. Several other flowers were fertilisedwith their own pollen, and twenty-six capsules thus produced containedon an average 4.42 seeds per capsule; 100 of which weighed 42.61 grains.So that a cross of this kind appears to have increased slightly thenumber of seeds per capsule, in the ratio of 100 to 91; but thesecrossed seeds were lighter than the self-fertilised in the ratio of 86to 100. I doubt, however, from other observations, whether these resultsare fully trustworthy. The two lots of seeds, after germinating on sand,were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of nine pots, and weretreated in every respect like the plants in the previous experiments.The remaining seeds, some in a state of germination and some not so,were sown on the opposite sides of a large pot (Number 10); and the fourtallest plants on each side of this pot were measured. The result isshown in Table 2/12.TABLE 2/12.

Looking to each pair, it may be seen that only thirteen of thecrossed plants, whilst eighteen of the self-fertilised plants exceedtheir opponents. A record was kept with respect to the plant whichflowered first in each pot; and only two of the crossed flowered beforeone of the self-fertilised in the same pot; whilst eight of theself-fertilised flowered first. It thus appears that the crossed plantsare slightly inferior in height and in earliness of flowering to theself-fertilised. But the inferiority in height is so small, namely as100 to 106, that I should have felt very doubtful on this head, had Inot cut down all the plants (except those in the crowded pot Number 10)close to the ground and weighed them. The twenty-seven crossed plantsweighed 16 1/2 ounces, and the twenty-seven self-fertilised plants 201/2 ounces; and this gives a ratio of 100 to 124.A self-fertilised plant of the same parentage as those in Table 2/12 hadbeen raised in a separate pot for a distinct purpose; and it provedpartially sterile, the anthers containing very little pollen. Severalflowers on this plant were crossed with the little pollen which could beobtained from the other flowers on the same plant; and other flowerswere self-fertilised. From the seeds thus produced four crossed and fourself-fertilised plants were raised, which were planted in the usualmanner on the opposite sides of two pots. All these four crossed plantswere inferior in height to their opponents; they averaged 78.18 inches,whilst the four self-fertilised plants averaged 84.8 inches; or as 100to 108. (2/2. From one of these self-fertilised plants, spontaneouslyself-fertilised, I gathered twenty-four capsules, and they contained onan average only 3.2 seeds per capsule; so that this plant had apparentlyinherited some of the sterility of its parent.) This case, therefore,confirms the last. Taking all the evidence together, we must concludethat these strictly self-fertilised plants grew a little taller, wereheavier, and generally flowered before those derived from a crossbetween two flowers on the same plant. These latter plants thus presenta wonderful contrast with those derived from a cross between twodistinct individuals.THE EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING OF A CROSS WITH A DISTINCT OR FRESH STOCKBELONGING TO THE SAME VARIETY.From the two foregoing series of experiments we see, firstly, the goodeffects during several successive generations of a cross betweendistinct plants, although these were in some degree inter-related andhad been grown under nearly the same conditions; and, secondly, theabsence of all such good effects from a cross between flowers on thesame plant; the comparison in both cases being made with the offspringof flowers fertilised with their own pollen. The experiments now to begiven show how powerfully and beneficially plants, which have beenintercrossed during many successive generations, having been kept allthe time under nearly uniform conditions, are affected by a cross withanother plant belonging to the same variety, but to a distinct family orstock, which had grown under different conditions.[Several flowers on the crossed plants of the ninth generation in Table2/10, were crossed with pollen from another crossed plant of the samelot. The seedlings thus raised formed the tenth intercrossed generation,and I will call them the "INTERCROSSED PLANTS." Several other flowers onthe same crossed plants of the ninth generation were fertilised (nothaving been castrated) with pollen taken from plants of the samevariety, but belonging to a distinct family, which had been grown in adistant garden at Colchester, and therefore under somewhat differentconditions. The capsules produced by this cross contained, to mysurprise, fewer and lighter seeds than did the capsules of theintercrossed plants; but this, I think, must have been accidental. Theseedlings raised from them I will call the "COLCHESTER-CROSSED." The twolots of seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in the usualmanner on the opposite sides of five pots, and the remaining seeds,whether or not in a state of germination, were thickly sown on theopposite sides of a very large pot, Number 6 in Table 2/13. In three ofthe six pots, after the young plants had twined a short way up theirsticks, one of the Colchester-crossed plants was much taller than anyone of the intercrossed plants on the opposite side of the same pot; andin the three other pots somewhat taller. I should state that two of theColchester-crossed plants in Pot 4, when about two-thirds grown, becamemuch diseased, and were, together with their intercrossed opponents,rejected. The remaining nineteen plants, when almost fully grown, weremeasured, with the following result:TABLE 2/13. Ipomoea purpurea.Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Colchester-Crossed Plants.Column 3: Intercrossed Plants of the Tenth Generation.Pot 1 :   87      :   78.Pot 1 :   87 4/8  :   68 4/8.Pot 1 :   85 1/8  :   94 4/8.Pot 2 :   93 6/8  :   60.Pot 2 :   85 4/8  :   87 2/8.Pot 2 :   90 5/8  :   45 4/8.Pot 3 :   84 2/8  :   70 1/8.Pot 3 :   92 4/8  :   81 6/8.Pot 3 :   85      :   86 2/8.Pot 4 :   95 6/8  :   65 1/8.Pot 5 :   90 4/8  :   85 6/8.Pot 5 :   86 6/8  :   63.Pot 5 :   84      :   62 6/8.Pot 6 :   90 4/8  :   43 4/8.Pot 6 :   75      :   39 6/8.Pot 6 :   71      :   30 2/8.Pot 6 :   83 6/8  :   86.Pot 6 :   63      :   53.Pot 6 :   65      :   48 6/8.Crowded plants in a very large pot.Total : 1596.50   : 1249.75.In sixteen out of these nineteen pairs, the Colchester-crossed plantexceeded in height its intercrossed opponent. The average height of theColchester-crossed is 84.03 inches, and that of the intercrossed 65.78inches; or as 100 to 78. With respect to the fertility of the two lots,it was too troublesome to collect and count the capsules on all theplants; so I selected two of the best pots, 5 and 6, and in these theColchester-crossed produced 269 mature and half-mature capsules, whilstan equal number of the intercrossed plants produced only 154 capsules;or as 100 to 57. By weight the capsules from the Colchester-crossedplants were to those from the intercrossed plants as 100 to 51; so thatthe former probably contained a somewhat larger average number ofseeds.]We learn from this important experiment that plants in some degreerelated, which had been intercrossed during the nine previousgenerations, when they were fertilised with pollen from a fresh stock,yielded seedlings as superior to the seedlings of the tenth intercrossedgeneration, as these latter were to the self-fertilised plants of thecorresponding generation. For if we look to the plants of the ninthgeneration in Table 2/10 (and these offer in most respects the faireststandard of comparison) we find that the intercrossed plants were inheight to the self-fertilised as 100 to 79, and in fertility as 100 to26; whilst the Colchester-crossed plants are in height to theintercrossed as 100 to 78, and in fertility as 100 to 51.[THE DESCENDANTS OF THE SELF-FERTILISED PLANT, NAMED HERO, WHICHAPPEARED IN THE SIXTH SELF-FERTILISED GENERATION.In the five generations before the sixth, the crossed plant of each pairwas taller than its self-fertilised opponent; but in the sixthgeneration (Table 2/7, Pot 2) the Hero appeared, which after a long anddubious struggle conquered its crossed opponent, though by only half aninch. I was so much surprised at this fact, that I resolved to ascertainwhether this plant would transmit its powers of growth to its seedlings.Several flowers on Hero were therefore fertilised with their own pollen,and the seedlings thus raised were put into competition withself-fertilised and intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation.The three lots of seedlings thus all belong to the seventh generation.Their relative heights are shown in Tables 2/14 and 2/15.TABLE 2/14. Ipomoea purpurea.Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants of the Seventh Generation, Children ofHero.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants of the Seventh Generation.Pot 1 :  74     :  89 4/8.Pot 1 :  60     :  61.Pot 1 :  55 2/8 :  49.Pot 2 :  92     :  82.Pot 2 :  91 6/8 :  56.Pot 2 :  74 2/8 :  38.Total : 447.25  : 375.50.The average height of the six self-fertilised children of Hero is 74.54inches, whilst that of the ordinary self-fertilised plants of thecorresponding generation is only 62.58 inches, or as 100 to 84.TABLE 2/15. Ipomoea purpurea.Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants of the Seventh Generation, Children ofHero.Column 3: Intercrossed Plants of the Seventh Generation.Pot 3 :  92     :  76 6/8.Pot 4 :  87     :  89.Pot 4 :  87 6/8 :  86 6/8.Total : 266.75  : 252.50.Here the average height of the three self-fertilised children of Hero is88.91 inches, whilst that of the intercrossed plants is 84.16; or as 100to 95. We thus see that the self-fertilised children of Hero certainlyinherit the powers of growth of their parents; for they greatly exceedin height the self-fertilised offspring of the other self-fertilisedplants, and even exceed by a trifle the intercrossed plants,--all of thecorresponding generation.Several flowers on the self-fertilised children of Hero in Table 2/14were fertilised with pollen from the same flower; and from the seedsthus produced, self-fertilised plants of the eighth generation(grandchildren of Hero) were raised. Several other flowers on the sameplants were crossed with pollen from the other children of Hero. Theseedlings raised from this cross may be considered as the offspring ofthe union of brothers and sisters. The result of the competition betweenthese two sets of seedlings (namely self-fertilised and the offspring ofbrothers and sisters) is given in Table 2/16.TABLE 2/16.

Eighth Generation.Pot 1 :   86 6/8  :  95 6/8.Pot 1 :   90 3/8  :  95 3/8.Pot 2 :   96      :  85.Pot 2 :   77 2/8  :  93.Pot 3 :   73      :  86 2/8.Pot 3 :   66      :  82 2/8.Pot 3 :   84 4/8  :  70 6/8.Pot 4 :   88 1/8  :  66 3/8.Pot 4 :   84      :  15 4/8.Pot 4 :   36 2/8  :  38.Pot 4 :   74      :  78 3/8.Pot 5 :   90 1/8  :  82 6/8.Pot 5 :   90 5/8  :  83 6/8.Total : 1037.00   : 973.16.The average height of the thirteen self-fertilised grandchildren of Herois 79.76 inches, and that of the grandchildren from a cross between theself-fertilised children is 74.85; or as 100 to 94. But in Pot 4 one ofthe crossed plants grew only to a height of 15 1/2 inches; and if thisplant and its opponent are struck out, as would be the fairest plan, theaverage height of the crossed plants exceeds only by a fraction of aninch that of the self-fertilised plants. It is therefore clear that across between the self-fertilised children of Hero did not produce anybeneficial effect worth notice; and it is very doubtful whether thisnegative result can be attributed merely to the fact of brothers andsisters having been united, for the ordinary intercrossed plants of theseveral successive generations must often have been derived from theunion of brothers and sisters (as shown in Chapter 1), and yet all ofthem were greatly superior to the self-fertilised plants. We aretherefore driven to the suspicion, which we shall soon see strengthened,that Hero transmitted to its offspring a peculiar constitution adaptedfor self-fertilisation.It would appear that the self-fertilised descendants of Hero have notonly inherited from Hero a power of growth equal to that of the ordinaryintercrossed plants, but have become more fertile when self-fertilisedthan is usual with the plants of the present species. The flowers on theself-fertilised grandchildren of Hero in Table 2.16 (the eighthgeneration of self-fertilised plants) were fertilised with their ownpollen and produced plenty of capsules, ten of which (though this is toofew a number for a safe average) contained 5.2 seeds per capsule,--ahigher average than was observed in any other case with theself-fertilised plants. The anthers produced by these self-fertilisedgrandchildren were also as well developed and contained as much pollenas those on the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation;whereas this was not the case with the ordinary self-fertilised plantsof the later generations. Nevertheless some few of the flowers producedby the grandchildren of Hero were slightly monstrous, like those of theordinary self-fertilised plants of the later generations. In order notto recur to the subject of fertility, I may add that twenty-oneself-fertilised capsules, spontaneously produced by thegreat-grandchildren of Hero (forming the ninth generation ofself-fertilised plants), contained on an average 4.47 seeds; and this isas high an average as the self-fertilised flowers of any generationusually yielded.Several flowers on the self-fertilised grandchildren of Hero in Table2/16 were fertilised with pollen from the same flower; and the seedlingsraised from them (great-grandchildren of Hero) formed the ninthself-fertilised generation. Several other flowers were crossed withpollen from another grandchild, so that they may be considered as theoffspring of brothers and sisters, and the seedlings thus raised may becalled the INTERCROSSED great-grandchildren. And lastly, other flowerswere fertilised with pollen from a distinct stock, and the seedlingsthus raised may be called the COLCHESTER-CROSSED great-grandchildren. Inmy anxiety to see what the result would be, I unfortunately planted thethree lots of seeds (after they had germinated on sand) in the hothousein the middle of winter, and in consequence of this the seedlings(twenty in number of each kind) became very unhealthy, some growing onlya few inches in height, and very few to their proper height. The result,therefore, cannot be fully trusted; and it would be useless to give themeasurements in detail. In order to strike as fair an average aspossible, I first excluded all the plants under 50 inches in height,thus rejecting all the most unhealthy plants. The six self-fertilisedthus left were on an average 66.86 inches high; the eight intercrossedplants 63.2 high; and the seven Colchester-crossed 65.37 high; so thatthere was not much difference between the three sets, theself-fertilised plants having a slight advantage. Nor was there anygreat difference when only the plants under 36 inches in height wereexcluded. Nor again when all the plants, however much dwarfed andunhealthy, were included. In this latter case the Colchester-crossedgave the lowest average of all; and if these plants had been in anymarked manner superior to the other two lots, as from my formerexperience I fully expected they would have been, I cannot but thinkthat some vestige of such superiority would have been evident,notwithstanding the very unhealthy condition of most of the plants. Noadvantage, as far as we can judge, was derived from intercrossing two ofthe grandchildren of Hero, any more than when two of the children werecrossed. It appears therefore that Hero and its descendants have variedfrom the common type, not only in acquiring great power of growth, andincreased fertility when subjected to self-fertilisation, but in notprofiting from a cross with a distinct stock; and this latter fact, iftrustworthy, is a unique case, as far as I have observed in all myexperiments.]SUMMARY ON THE GROWTH, VIGOUR, AND FERTILITY OF THE SUCCESSIVEGENERATIONS OF THE CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF Ipomoeapurpurea, TOGETHER WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.In Table 2/17, we see the average or mean heights of the ten successivegenerations of the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants, grown incompetition with each other; and in the right hand column we have theratios of the one to the other, the height of the intercrossed plantsbeing taken at 100. In the bottom line the mean height of theseventy-three intercrossed plants is shown to be 85.84 inches, and thatof the seventy-three self-fertilised plants 66.02 inches, or as 100 to77.TABLE 2/17.

Diagram showing the mean heights of the crossed andself-fertilised plants of Ipomoea purpurea in the ten generations; themean height of the crossed plants being taken as 100. On the right hand,the mean heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of all thegenerations taken together are shown (as eleven pairs of unequalvertical lines.))The mean height of the self-fertilised plants in each of the tengenerations is also shown in the diagram 2/1, that of the intercrossedplants being taken at 100, and on the right side we see the relativeheights of the seventy-three intercrossed plants, and of theseventy-three self-fertilised plants. The difference in height betweenthe crossed and self-fertilised plants will perhaps be best appreciatedby an illustration: If all the men in a country were on an average 6feet high, and there were some families which had been long and closelyinterbred, these would be almost dwarfs, their average height during tengenerations being only 4 feet 8 1/4 inches.It should be especially observed that the average difference between thecrossed and self-fertilised plants is not due to a few of the formerhaving grown to an extraordinary height, or to a few of theself-fertilised being extremely short, but to all the crossed plantshaving surpassed their self-fertilised opponents, with the few followingexceptions. The first occurred in the sixth generation, in which theplant named "Hero" appeared; two in the eighth generation, but theself-fertilised plants in this generation were in an anomalouscondition, as they grew at first at an unusual rate and conquered for atime the opposed crossed plants; and two exceptions in the ninthgeneration, though one of these plants only equalled its crossedopponent. Therefore, of the seventy-three crossed plants, sixty-eightgrew to a greater height than the self-fertilised plants, to which theywere opposed.In the right-hand column of figures, the difference in height betweenthe crossed and self-fertilised plants in the successive generations isseen to fluctuate much, as might indeed have been expected from thesmall number of plants measured in each generation being insufficient togive a fair average. It should be remembered that the absolute height ofthe plants goes for nothing, as each pair was measured as soon as one ofthem had twined up to the summit of its rod. The great difference in thetenth generation, namely, 100 to 54, no doubt was partly accidental,though, when these plants were weighed, the difference was even greater,namely, 100 to 44. The smallest amount of difference occurred in thefourth and the eighth generations, and this was apparently due to boththe crossed and self-fertilised plants having become unhealthy, whichprevented the former attaining their usual degree of superiority. Thiswas an unfortunate circumstance, but my experiments were not thusvitiated, as both lots of plants were exposed to the same conditions,whether favourable or unfavourable.There is reason to believe that the flowers of this Ipomoea, whengrowing out of doors, are habitually crossed by insects, so that thefirst seedlings which I raised from purchased seeds were probably theoffspring of a cross. I infer that this is the case, firstly fromhumble-bees often visiting the flowers, and from the quantity of pollenleft by them on the stigmas of such flowers; and, secondly, from theplants raised from the same lot of seed varying greatly in the colour oftheir flowers, for as we shall hereafter see, this indicates muchintercrossing. (2/3. Verlot says 'Sur la Production des Vari�t�s' 1865page 66, that certain varieties of a closely allied plant, theConvolvulus tricolor, cannot be kept pure unless grown at a distancefrom all other varieties.) It is, therefore, remarkable that the plantsraised by me from flowers which were, in all probability,self-fertilised for the first time after many generations of crossing,should have been so markedly inferior in height to the intercrossedplants as they were, namely, as 76 to 100. As the plants which wereself-fertilised in each succeeding generation necessarily became muchmore closely interbred in the later than in the earlier generations, itmight have been expected that the difference in height between them andthe crossed plants would have gone on increasing; but, so far is thisfrom being the case, that the difference between the two sets of plantsin the seventh, eighth, and ninth generations taken together is lessthan in the first and second generations together. When, however, weremember that the self-fertilised and crossed plants are all descendedfrom the same mother-plant, that many of the crossed plants in eachgeneration were related, often closely related, and that all wereexposed to the same conditions, which, as we shall hereafter find, is avery important circumstance, it is not at all surprising that thedifference between them should have somewhat decreased in the latergenerations. It is, on the contrary, an astonishing fact, that thecrossed plants should have been victorious, even to a slight degree,over the self-fertilised plants of the later generations.The much greater constitutional vigour of the crossed than of theself-fertilised plants, was proved on five occasions in various ways;namely, by exposing them, while young, to a low temperature or to asudden change of temperature, or by growing them, under veryunfavourable conditions, in competition with full-grown plants of otherkinds.With respect to the productiveness of the crossed and self-fertilisedplants of the successive generations, my observations unfortunately werenot made on any uniform plan, partly from the want of time, and partlyfrom not having at first intended to observe more than a singlegeneration. A summary of the results is here given in a tabulated form,the fertility of the crossed plants being taken as 100.TABLE 2/18. Ratio of productiveness of crossed and self-fertilisedplants. Ipomoea purpurea.FIRST GENERATION OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS GROWING INCOMPETITION WITH ONE ANOTHER.Sixty-five capsules produced from flowers on five crossed plantsfertilised by pollen from a distinct plant, and fifty-five capsulesproduced from flowers on five self-fertilised plants fertilised by theirown pollen, contained seeds in the proportion of : 100 to 93.Fifty-six spontaneously self-fertilised capsules on the above fivecrossed plants, and twenty-five spontaneously self-fertilised capsuleson the above five self-fertilised plants, yielded seeds in theproportion of : 100 to 99.Combining the total number of capsules produced by these plants, and theaverage number of seeds in each, the above crossed and self-fertilisedplants yielded seeds in the proportion of : 100 to 64.Other plants of this first generation grown under unfavourableconditions and spontaneously self-fertilised, yielded seeds in theproportion of : 100 to 45.THIRD GENERATION OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS.Crossed capsules compared with self-fertilised capsules contained seedsin the ratio of : 100 to 94.An equal number of crossed and self-fertilised plants, bothspontaneously self-fertilised, produced capsules in the ratio of : 100to 38.And these capsules contained seeds in the ratio of : 100 to 94.Combining these data, the productiveness of the crossed to theself-fertilised plants, both spontaneously self-fertilised, was as : 100to 35.FOURTH GENERATION OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS.Capsules from flowers on the crossed plants fertilised by pollen fromanother plant, and capsules from flowers on the self-fertilised plantsfertilised with their own pollen, contained seeds in the proportion of :100 to 94.FIFTH GENERATION OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS.The crossed plants produced spontaneously a vast number more pods (notactually counted) than the self-fertilised, and these contained seeds inthe proportion of : 100 to 89.NINTH GENERATION OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS.Fourteen crossed plants, spontaneously self-fertilised, and fourteenself-fertilised plants spontaneously self-fertilised, yielded capsules(the average number of seeds per capsule not having been ascertained) inthe proportion of : 100 to 26.PLANTS DERIVED FROM A CROSSED WITH A FRESH STOCK COMPARED WITHINTERCROSSED PLANTS.The offspring of intercrossed plants of the ninth generation, crossed bya fresh stock, compared with plants of the same stock intercrossedduring ten generations, both sets of plants left uncovered and naturallyfertilised, produced capsules by weight as : 100 to 51.We see in this table that the crossed plants are always in some degreemore productive than the self-fertilised plants, by whatever standardthey are compared. The degree differs greatly; but this depends chieflyon whether an average was taken of the seeds alone, or of the capsulesalone, or of both combined. The relative superiority of the crossedplants is chiefly due to their producing a much greater number ofcapsules, and not to each capsule containing a larger average number ofseeds. For instance, in the third generation the crossed andself-fertilised plants produced capsules in the ratio of 100 to 38,whilst the seeds in the capsules on the crossed plants were to those onthe self-fertilised plants only as 100 to 94. In the eighth generationthe capsules on two self-fertilised plants (not included in table 2/18),grown in separate pots and thus not subjected to any competition,yielded the large average of 5.1 seeds. The smaller number of capsulesproduced by the self-fertilised plants may be in part, but notaltogether, attributed to their lessened size or height; this beingchiefly due to their lessened constitutional vigour, so that they werenot able to compete with the crossed plants growing in the same pots.The seeds produced by the crossed flowers on the crossed plants were notalways heavier than the self-fertilised seeds on the self-fertilisedplants. The lighter seeds, whether produced from crossed orself-fertilised flowers, generally germinated before the heavier seeds.I may add that the crossed plants, with very few exceptions, floweredbefore their self-fertilised opponents, as might have been expected fromtheir greater height and vigour.The impaired fertility of the self-fertilised plants was shown inanother way, namely, by their anthers being smaller than those in theflowers on the crossed plants. This was first observed in the seventhgeneration, but may have occurred earlier. Several anthers from flowerson the crossed and self-fertilised plants of the eighth generation werecompared under the microscope; and those from the former were generallylonger and plainly broader than the anthers of the self-fertilisedplants. The quantity of pollen contained in one of the latter was, asfar as could be judged by the eye, about half of that contained in onefrom a crossed plant. The impaired fertility of the self-fertilisedplants of the eighth generation was also shown in another manner, whichmay often be observed in hybrids--namely, by the first-formed flowersbeing sterile. For instance, the fifteen first flowers on aself-fertilised plant of one of the later generations were carefullyfertilised with their own pollen, and eight of them dropped off; at thesame time fifteen flowers on a crossed plant growing in the same potwere self-fertilised, and only one dropped off. On two other crossedplants of the same generation, several of the earliest flowers wereobserved to fertilise themselves and to produce capsules. In the plantsof the ninth, and I believe of some previous generations, very many ofthe flowers, as already stated, were slightly monstrous; and thisprobably was connected with their lessened fertility.All the self-fertilised plants of the seventh generation, and I believeof one or two previous generations, produced flowers of exactly the sametint, namely, of a rich dark purple. So did all the plants, without anyexception, in the three succeeding generations of self-fertilisedplants; and very many were raised on account of other experiments inprogress not here recorded. My attention was first called to this factby my gardener remarking that there was no occasion to label theself-fertilised plants, as they could always be known by their colour.The flowers were as uniform in tint as those of a wild species growingin a state of nature; whether the same tint occurred, as is probable, inthe earlier generations, neither my gardener nor self could recollect.The flowers on the plants which were first raised from purchased seed,as well as during the first few generations, varied much in the depth ofthe purple tint; many were more or less pink, and occasionally a whitevariety appeared. The crossed plants continued to the tenth generationto vary in the same manner as before, but to a much less degree, owing,probably, to their having become more or less closely inter-related. Wemust therefore attribute the extraordinary uniformity of colour in theflowers on the plants of the seventh and succeeding self-fertilisedgenerations, to inheritance not having been interfered with by crossesduring several preceding generations, in combination with the conditionsof life having been very uniform.A plant appeared in the sixth self-fertilised generation, named theHero, which exceeded by a little in height its crossed antagonist, andwhich transmitted its powers of growth and increased self-fertility toits children and grandchildren. A cross between the children of Hero didnot give to the grandchildren any advantage over the self-fertilisedgrandchildren raised from the self-fertilised children. And as far as myobservations can be trusted, which were made on very unhealthy plants,the great-grandchildren raised from intercrossing the grandchildren hadno advantage over the seedlings from the grandchildren the product ofcontinued self-fertilisation; and what is far more remarkable, thegreat-grandchildren raised by crossing the grandchildren with a freshstock, had no advantage over either the intercrossed or self-fertilisedgreat-grandchildren. It thus appears that Hero and its descendantsdiffered in constitution in an extraordinary manner from ordinary plantsof the present species.Although the plants raised during ten successive generations fromcrosses between distinct yet inter-related plants almost invariablyexceeded in height, constitutional vigour, and fertility theirself-fertilised opponents, it has been proved that seedlings raised byintercrossing flowers on the same plant are by no means superior, on thecontrary are somewhat inferior in height and weight, to seedlings raisedfrom flowers fertilised with their own pollen. This is a remarkablefact, which seems to indicate that self-fertilisation is in some mannermore advantageous than crossing, unless the cross brings with it, as isgenerally the case, some decided and preponderant advantage; but to thissubject I shall recur in a future chapter.The benefits which so generally follow from a cross between two plantsapparently depend on the two differing somewhat in constitution orcharacter. This is shown by the seedlings from the intercrossed plantsof the ninth generation, when crossed with pollen from a fresh stock,being as superior in height and almost as superior in fertility to theagain intercrossed plants, as these latter were to seedlings fromself-fertilised plants of the corresponding generation. We thus learnthe important fact that the mere act of crossing two distinct plants,which are in some degree inter-related and which have been longsubjected to nearly the same conditions, does little good as comparedwith that from a cross between plants belonging to different stocks orfamilies, and which have been subjected to somewhat differentconditions. We may attribute the good derived from the crossing of theintercrossed plants during the ten successive generations to their stilldiffering somewhat in constitution or character, as was indeed proved bytheir flowers still differing somewhat in colour. But the severalconclusions which may be deduced from the experiments on Ipomoea will bemore fully considered in the final chapters, after all my otherobservations have been given.CHAPTER III.SCROPHULARIACEAE, GESNERIACEAE, LABIATAE, ETC.Mimulus luteus; height, vigour, and fertility of the crossed andself-fertilised plants of the first four generations.Appearance of a new,  tall, and highly self-fertile variety.Offspring from a cross between self-fertilised plants.Effects of a cross with a fresh stock.Effects of crossing flowers on the same plant.Summary on Mimulus luteus.Digitalis purpurea, superiority of the crossed plants.Effects of crossing flowers on the same plant.Calceolaria.Linaria vulgaris.Verbascum thapsus.Vandellia nummularifolia.Cleistogene flowers.Gesneria pendulina.Salvia coccinea.Origanum vulgare, great increase of the crossed plants by stolons.Thunbergia alata.In the family of the Scrophulariaceae I experimented on species in thesix following genera: Mimulus, Digitalis, Calceolaria, Linaria,Verbascum, and Vandellia.[3/2. SCROPHULARIACEAE.--Mimulus luteus.The plants which I raised from purchased seed varied greatly in thecolour of their flowers, so that hardly two individuals were quitealike; the corolla being of all shades of yellow, with the mostdiversified blotches of purple, crimson, orange, and coppery brown. Butthese plants differed in no other respect. (3/1. I sent severalspecimens with variously coloured flowers to Kew, and Dr. Hooker informsme that they all consisted of Mimulus luteus. The flowers with much redhave been named by horticulturists as var. Youngiana.) The flowers areevidently well adapted for fertilisation by the agency of insects; andin the case of a closely allied species, Mimulus rosea, I have watchedbees entering the flowers, thus getting their backs well dusted withpollen; and when they entered another flower the pollen was licked offtheir backs by the two-lipped stigma, the lips of which are irritableand close like a forceps on the pollen-grains. If no pollen is enclosedbetween the lips, these open again after a time. Mr. Kitchener hasingeniously explained the use of these movements, namely, to prevent theself-fertilisation of the flower. (3/2. 'A Year's Botany' 1874 page118.) If a bee with no pollen on its back enters a flower it touches thestigma, which quickly closes, and when the bee retires dusted withpollen, it can leave none on the stigma of the same flower. But as soonas it enters any other flower, plenty of pollen is left on the stigma,which will be thus cross-fertilised. Nevertheless, if insects areexcluded, the flowers fertilise themselves perfectly and produce plentyof seed; but I did not ascertain whether this is effected by the stamensincreasing in length with advancing age, or by the bending down of thepistil. The chief interest in my experiments on the present species,lies in the appearance in the fourth self-fertilised generation of avariety which bore large peculiarly-coloured flowers, and grew to agreater height than the other varieties; it likewise became more highlyself-fertile, so that this variety resembles the plant named Hero, whichappeared in the sixth self-fertilised generation of Ipomoea.Some flowers on one of the plants raised from the purchased seeds werefertilised with their own pollen; and others on the same plant werecrossed with pollen from a distinct plant. The seeds from twelvecapsules thus produced were placed in separate watch-glasses forcomparison; and those from the six crossed capsules appeared to the eyehardly more numerous than those from the six self-fertilised capsules.But when the seeds were weighed, those from the crossed capsulesamounted to 1.02 grain, whilst those from the self-fertilised capsuleswere only .81 grain; so that the former were either heavier or morenumerous than the latter, in the ratio of 100 to 79.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FIRST GENERATION.Having ascertained, by leaving crossed and self-fertilised seed on dampsand, that they germinated simultaneously, both kinds were thickly sownon opposite sides of a broad and rather shallow pan; so that the twosets of seedlings, which came up at the same time, were subjected to thesame unfavourable conditions. This was a bad method of treatment, butthis species was one of the first on which I experimented. When thecrossed seedlings were on an average half an inch high, theself-fertilised ones were only a quarter of an inch high. When grown totheir full height under the above unfavourable conditions, the fourtallest crossed plants averaged 7.62, and the four tallestself-fertilised 5.87 inches in height; or as 100 to 77. Ten flowers onthe crossed plants were fully expanded before one on the self-fertilisedplants. A few of these plants of both lots were transplanted into alarge pot with plenty of good earth, and the self-fertilised plants, notnow being subjected to severe competition, grew during the followingyear as tall as the crossed plants; but from a case which follows it isdoubtful whether they would have long continued equal. Some flowers onthe crossed plants were crossed with pollen from another plant, and thecapsules thus produced contained a rather greater weight of seed thanthose on the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.Seeds from the foregoing plants, fertilised in the manner just stated,were sown on the opposite sides of a small pot (1) and came up crowded.The four tallest crossed seedlings, at the time of flowering, averaged 8inches in height, whilst the four tallest self-fertilised plantsaveraged only 4 inches. Crossed seeds were sown by themselves in asecond small pot, and self-fertilised seeds were sown by themselves in athird small pot so that there was no competition whatever between thesetwo lots. Nevertheless the crossed plants grew from 1 to 2 inches higheron an average than the self-fertilised. Both lots looked equallyvigorous, but the crossed plants flowered earlier and more profuselythan the self-fertilised. In Pot 1, in which the two lots competed witheach other, the crossed plants flowered first and produced a largenumber of capsules, whilst the self-fertilised produced only nineteen.The contents of twelve capsules from the crossed flowers on the crossedplants, and of twelve capsules from self-fertilised flowers on theself-fertilised plants, were placed in separate watch-glasses forcomparison; and the crossed seeds seemed more numerous by half than theself-fertilised.The plants on both sides of Pot 1, after they had seeded, were cut downand transplanted into a large pot with plenty of good earth, and on thefollowing spring, when they had grown to a height of between 5 and 6inches, the two lots were equal, as occurred in a similar experiment inthe last generation. But after some weeks the crossed plants exceededthe self-fertilised ones on the opposite side of the same pot, thoughnot nearly to so great a degree as before, when they were subjected tovery severe competition.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE THIRD GENERATION.Crossed seeds from the crossed plants, and self-fertilised seeds fromthe self-fertilised plants of the last generation, were sown thickly onopposite sides of a small pot, Number 1. The two tallest plants on eachside were measured after they had flowered, and the two crossed oneswere 12 and 7 1/2 inches, and the two self-fertilised ones 8 and 5 1/2inches in height; that is, in the ratio of 100 to 69. Twenty flowers onthe crossed plants were again crossed and produced twenty capsules; tenof which contained 1.33 grain weight of seeds. Thirty flowers on theself-fertilised plants were again self-fertilised and producedtwenty-six capsules; ten of the best of which (many being very poor)contained only .87 grain weight of seeds; that is, in the ratio of 100to 65 by weight.The superiority of the crossed over the self-fertilised plants wasproved in various ways. Self-fertilised seeds were sown on one side of apot, and two days afterwards crossed seeds on the opposite side. The twolots of seedlings were equal until they were above half an inch high;but when fully grown the two tallest crossed plants attained a height of12 1/2 and 8 3/4 inches, whilst the two tallest self-fertilised plantswere only 8 and 5 1/2 inches high.In a third pot, crossed seeds were sown four days after theself-fertilised, and the seedlings from the latter had at first, asmight have been expected, an advantage; but when the two lots werebetween 5 and 6 inches in height, they were equal, and ultimately thethree tallest crossed plants were 11, 10, and 8 inches, whilst the threetallest self-fertilised were 12, 8 1/2, and 7 1/2 inches in height. Sothat there was not much difference between them, the crossed plantshaving an average advantage of only the third of an inch. The plantswere cut down, and without being disturbed were transplanted into alarger pot. Thus the two lots started fair on the following spring, andnow the crossed plants showed their inherent superiority, for the twotallest were 13 inches, whilst the two tallest self-fertilised plantswere only 11 and 8 1/2 inches in height; or as 100 to 75. The two lotswere allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously: the crossed plantsproduced a large number of capsules, whilst the self-fertilised producedvery few and poor ones. The seeds from eight of the capsules on thecrossed plants weighed .65 grain, whilst those from eight of thecapsules on the self-fertilised plants weighed only .22 grain; or as 100to 34.The crossed plants in the above three pots, as in almost all theprevious experiments, flowered before the self-fertilised. This occurredeven in the third pot in which the crossed seeds were sown four daysafter the self-fertilised seeds.Lastly, seeds of both lots were sown on opposite sides of a large pot inwhich a Fuchsia had long been growing, so that the earth was full ofroots. Both lots grew miserably; but the crossed seedlings had anadvantage at all times, and ultimately attained to a height of 3 1/2inches, whilst the self-fertilised seedlings never exceeded 1 inch. Theseveral foregoing experiments prove in a decisive manner the superiorityin constitutional vigour of the crossed over the self-fertilised plants.In the three generations now described and taken together, the averageheight of the ten tallest crossed plants was 8.19 inches, and that ofthe ten tallest self-fertilised plants 5.29 inches (the plants havingbeen grown in small pots), or as 100 to 65.In the next or fourth self-fertilised generation, several plants of anew and tall variety appeared, which increased in the laterself-fertilised generations, owing to its great self-fertility, to thecomplete exclusion of the original kinds. The same variety also appearedamongst the crossed plants, but as it was not at first regarded with anyparticular attention, I know not how far it was used for raising theintercrossed plants; and in the later crossed generations it was rarelypresent. Owing to the appearance of this tall variety, the comparison ofthe crossed and self-fertilised plants of the fifth and succeedinggenerations was rendered unfair, as all the self-fertilised and only afew or none of the crossed plants consisted of it. Nevertheless, theresults of the later experiments are in some respects well worth giving.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FOURTH GENERATION.Seeds of the two kinds, produced in the usual way from the two sets ofplants of the third generation, were sown on opposite sides of two pots(1 and 2); but the seedlings were not thinned enough and did not growwell. Many of the self-fertilised plants, especially in one of the pots,consisted of the new and tall variety above referred to, which borelarge and almost white flowers marked with crimson blotches. I will callit the WHITE VARIETY. I believe that it first appeared amongst both thecrossed and self-fertilised plants of the last generation; but neithermy gardener nor myself could remember any such variety in the seedlingsraised from the purchased seed. It must therefore have arisen eitherthrough ordinary variation, or, judging from its appearance amongst boththe crossed and self-fertilised plants, more probably through reversionto a formerly existing variety.In Pot 1 the tallest crossed plant was 8 1/2 inches, and the tallestself-fertilised 5 inches in height. In Pot 2, the tallest crossed plantwas 6 1/2 inches, and the tallest self-fertilised plant, which consistedof the white variety, 7 inches in height; and this was the firstinstance in my experiments on Mimulus in which the tallestself-fertilised plant exceeded the tallest crossed. Nevertheless, thetwo tallest crossed plants taken together were to the two tallestself-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 80. As yet the crossed plantswere superior to the self-fertilised in fertility; for twelve flowers onthe crossed plants were crossed and yielded ten capsules, the seeds ofwhich weighed 1.71 grain. Twenty flowers on the self-fertilised plantswere self-fertilised, and produced fifteen capsules, all appearing poor;and the seeds from ten of them weighed only .68 grain, so that from anequal number of capsules the crossed seeds were to the self-fertilisedin weight as 100 to 40.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FIFTH GENERATION.Seeds from both lots of the fourth generation, fertilised in the usualmanner, were sown on opposite sides of three pots. When the seedlingsflowered, most of the self-fertilised plants were found to consist ofthe tall white variety. Several of the crossed plants in Pot 1 likewisebelonged to this variety, as did a very few in Pots 2 and 3. The tallestcrossed plant in Pot 1 was 7 inches, and the tallest self-fertilisedplant on the opposite side 8 inches; in Pots 2 and 3 the tallest crossedwere 4 1/2 and 5 1/2, and the tallest self-fertilised 7 and 6 1/2 inchesin height; so that the average height of the tallest plants in the twolots was as 100 for the crossed to 126 for the self-fertilised; and thuswe have a complete reversal of what occurred in the four previousgenerations. Nevertheless, in all three pots the crossed plants retainedtheir habit of flowering before the self-fertilised. The plants wereunhealthy from being crowded and from the extreme heat of the season,and were in consequence more or less sterile; but the crossed plantswere somewhat less sterile than the self-fertilised plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SIXTH GENERATION.Seeds from plants of the fifth generation crossed and self-fertilised inthe usual manner were sown on opposite sides of several pots. On theself-fertilised side every single plant belonged to the tall whitevariety. On the crossed side some plants belonged to this variety, butthe greater number approached in character to the old and shorter kindswith smaller yellowish flowers blotched with coppery brown. When theplants on both sides were from 2 to 3 inches in height they were equal,but when fully grown the self-fertilised were decidedly the tallest andfinest plants, but, from want of time, they were not actually measured.In half the pots the first plant which flowered was a self-fertilisedone, and in the other half a crossed one. And now another remarkablechange was clearly perceived, namely, that the self-fertilised plantshad become more self-fertile than the crossed. The pots were all putunder a net to exclude insects, and the crossed plants producedspontaneously only fifty-five capsules, whilst the self-fertilisedplants produced eighty-one capsules, or as 100 to 147. The seeds fromnine capsules of both lots were placed in separate watch-glasses forcomparison, and the self-fertilised appeared rather the more numerous.Besides these spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, twenty flowers onthe crossed plants again crossed yielded sixteen capsules; twenty-fiveflowers on the self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised yieldedseventeen capsules, and this is a larger proportional number of capsulesthan was produced by the self-fertilised flowers on the self-fertilisedplants in the previous generations. The contents of ten capsules of boththese lots were compared in separate watch-glasses, and the seeds fromthe self-fertilised appeared decidedly more numerous than those from thecrossed plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SEVENTH GENERATION.Crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the crossed and self-fertilisedplants of the sixth generation were sown in the usual manner on oppositesides of three pots, and the seedlings were well and equally thinned.Every one of the self-fertilised plants (and many were raised) in this,as well as in the eighth and ninth generations, belonged to the tallwhite variety. Their uniformity of character, in comparison with theseedlings first raised from the purchased seed, was quite remarkable. Onthe other hand, the crossed plants differed much in the tints of theirflowers, but not, I think, to so great a degree as those first raised. Idetermined this time to measure the plants on both sides carefully. Theself-fertilised seedlings came up rather before the crossed, but bothlots were for a time of equal height. When first measured, the averageheight of the six tallest crossed plants in the three pots was 7.02, andthat of the six tallest self-fertilised plants 8.97 inches, or as 100 to128. When fully grown the same plants were again measured, with theresult shown in Table 3/18.TABLE 3/18. Mimulus luteus (Seventh Generation).Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1 : 11 2/8 : 19 1/8.Pot 1 : 11 7/8 : 18.Pot 2 : 12 6/8 : 18 2/8.Pot 2 : 11 2/8 : 14 6/8.Pot 3 :  9 6/8 : 12 6/8.Pot 3 : 11 6/8 : 11.Total : 68.63  : 93.88.The average height of the six crossed is here 11.43, and that of the sixself-fertilised 15.64, or as 100 to 137.As it is now evident that the tall white variety transmitted itscharacters faithfully, and as the self-fertilised plants consistedexclusively of this variety, it was manifest that they would alwaysexceed in height the crossed plants which belonged chiefly to theoriginal shorter varieties. This line of experiment was thereforediscontinued, and I tried whether intercrossing two self-fertilisedplants of the sixth generation, growing in distinct pots, would givetheir offspring any advantage over the offspring of flowers on one ofthe same plants fertilised with their own pollen. These latter seedlingsformed the seventh generation of self-fertilised plants, like those inthe right hand column in Table 3/18; the crossed plants were the productof six previous self-fertilised generations with an intercross in thelast generation. The seeds were allowed to germinate on sand, and wereplanted in pairs on opposite sides of four pots, all the remaining seedsbeing sown crowded on opposite sides of Pot 5 in Table 3/19; the threetallest on each side in this latter pot being alone measured. All theplants were twice measured--the first time whilst young, and the averageheight of the crossed plants to that of the self-fertilised was then as100 to 122. When fully grown they were again measured, as in Table 3/19.TABLE 3/19. Mimulus luteus.Heights of Plants in inches:Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Intercrossed Plants from Self-fertilised Plants of the SixthGeneration.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants of the Seventh Generation.Pot 1 :  12 6/8 :  15 2/8.Pot 1 :  10 4/8 :  11 5/8.Pot 1 :  10     :  11.Pot 1 :  14 5/8 :  11.Pot 2 :  10 2/8 :  11 3/8.Pot 2 :   7 6/8 :  11 4/8.Pot 2 :  12 1/8 :   8 5/8.Pot 2 :   7     :  14 3/8.Pot 3 :  13 5/8 :  10 3/8.Pot 3 :  12 2/8 :  11 6/8.Pot 4 :   7 1/8 :  14 6/8.Pot 4 :   8 2/8 :   7.Pot 4 :   7 2/8 :   8.Pot 5 :   8 5/8 :  10 2/8Pot 5 :   9     :   9 3/8.Pot 5 :   8 2/8 :   9 2/8.Crowded.Total : 159.38  : 175.50.The average height of the sixteen intercrossed plants is here 9.96inches, and that of the sixteen self-fertilised plants 10.96, or as 100to 110; so that the intercrossed plants, the progenitors of which hadbeen self-fertilised for the six previous generations, and had beenexposed during the whole time to remarkably uniform conditions, weresomewhat inferior in height to the plants of the seventh self-fertilisedgeneration. But as we shall presently see that a similar experiment madeafter two additional generations of self-fertilisation gave a differentresult, I know not how far to trust the present one. In three of thefive pots in Table 3/19 a self-fertilised plant flowered first, and inthe other two a crossed plant. These self-fertilised plants wereremarkably fertile, for twenty flowers fertilised with their own pollenproduced no less than nineteen very fine capsules!THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A DISTINCT STOCK.Some flowers on the self-fertilised plants in Pot 4 in Table 3/19 werefertilised with their own pollen, and plants of the eighthself-fertilised generation were thus raised, merely to serve as parentsin the following experiment. Several flowers on these plants wereallowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously (insects being of courseexcluded), and the plants raised from these seeds formed the ninthself-fertilised generation; they consisted wholly of the tall whitevariety with crimson blotches. Other flowers on the same plants of theeighth self-fertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken fromanother plant of the same lot; so that the seedlings thus raised werethe offspring of eight previous generations of self-fertilisation withan intercross in the last generation; these I will call the INTERCROSSEDPLANTS. Lastly, other flowers on the same plants of the eighthself-fertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken from plantswhich had been raised from seed procured from a garden at Chelsea. TheChelsea plants bore yellow flowers blotched with red, but differed in noother respect. They had been grown out of doors, whilst mine had beencultivated in pots in the greenhouse for the last eight generations, andin a different kind of soil. The seedlings raised from this cross with awholly different stock may be called the CHELSEA-CROSSED. The three lotsof seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate on bare sand; andwhenever a seed in all three lots, or in only two, germinated at thesame time, they were planted in pots superficially divided into three ortwo compartments. The remaining seeds, whether or not in a state ofgermination, were thickly sown in three divisions in a large pot, 10, inTable 3/20. When the plants had grown to their full height they weremeasured, as shown in Table 3/20; but only the three tallest plants ineach of the three divisions in Pot 10 were measured.TABLE 3/20.

But with respectto the latter it will be the fairest plan to strike out two dwarfed ones(only 4 inches in height), so as not to exaggerate the inferiority ofthe self-fertilised plants; and this will raise the average height ofthe seventeen remaining self-fertilised plants to 11.2 inches. Thereforethe Chelsea-crossed are to the intercrossed in height as 100 to 56; theChelsea-crossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 52; and theintercrossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 92. We thus see howimmensely superior in height the Chelsea-crossed are to the intercrossedand to the self-fertilised plants. They began to show their superioritywhen only one inch high. They were also, when fully grown, much morebranched with larger leaves and somewhat larger flowers than the plantsof the other two lots, so that if they had been weighed, the ratio wouldcertainly have been much higher than that of 100 to 56 and 52.The intercrossed plants are here to the self-fertilised in height as 100to 92; whereas in the analogous experiment given in Table 3/19 theintercrossed plants from the self-fertilised plants of the sixthgeneration were inferior in height to the self-fertilised plants in theratio of 100 to 110. I doubt whether this discordance in the results ofthe two experiments can be explained by the self-fertilised plants inthe present case having been raised from spontaneously self-fertilisedseeds, whereas in the former case they were raised from artificiallyself-fertilised seeds; nor by the present plants having beenself-fertilised during two additional generations, though this is a moreprobable explanation.With respect to fertility, the twenty-eight Chelsea-crossed plantsproduced 272 capsules; the twenty-seven intercrossed plants produced 24;and the seventeen self-fertilised plants 17 capsules. All the plantswere left uncovered so as to be naturally fertilised, and empty capsuleswere rejected.Therefore 20 Chelsea-crossed plants would have produced 194.29 capsules.Therefore 20 Intercrossed plants would have produced 17.77 capsules.Therefore 20 Self-fertilised plants would have produced 20.00 capsules.The seeds contained in 8 capsules from the Chelsea-crossed plantsweighed 1.1 grains.The seeds contained in 8 capsules from the Intercrossed plants weighed0.51 grains.The seeds contained in 8 capsules from the Self-fertilised plantsweighed 0.33 grains.If we combine the number of capsules produced together with the averageweight of contained seeds, we get the following extraordinary ratios:Weight of seed produced by the same number of Chelsea-crossed andintercrossed plants as 100 to 4.Weight of seed produced by the same number of Chelsea-crossed andself-fertilised plants as 100 to 3.Weight of seeds produced by the same number of intercrossed andself-fertilised plants as 100 to 73.It is also a remarkable fact that the Chelsea-crossed plants exceededthe two other lots in hardiness, as greatly as they did in height,luxuriance, and fertility. In the early autumn most of the pots werebedded out in the open ground; and this always injures plants which havebeen long kept in a warm greenhouse. All three lots consequentlysuffered greatly, but the Chelsea-crossed plants much less than theother two lots. On the 3rd of October the Chelsea-crossed plants beganto flower again, and continued to do so for some time; whilst not asingle flower was produced by the plants of the other two lots, thestems of which were cut almost down to the ground and seemed half dead.Early in December there was a sharp frost, and the stems ofChelsea-crossed were now cut down; but on the 23rd of December theybegan to shoot up again from the roots, whilst all the plants of theother two lots were quite dead.Although several of the self-fertilised seeds, from which the plants inthe right hand column in Table 3/20 were raised, germinated (and were ofcourse rejected) before any of those of the other two lots, yet in onlyone of the ten pots did a self-fertilised plant flower before theChelsea-crossed or the intercrossed plants growing in the same pots. Theplants of these two latter lots flowered at the same time, though theChelsea-crossed grew so much taller and more vigorously than theintercrossed.As already stated, the flowers of the plants originally raised from theChelsea seeds were yellow; and it deserves notice that every one of thetwenty-eight seedlings raised from the tall white variety fertilised,without being castrated, with pollen from the Chelsea plants, producedyellow flowers; and this shows how prepotent this colour, which is thenatural one of the species, is over the white colour.THE EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING OF INTERCROSSING FLOWERS ON THE SAME PLANT,INSTEAD OF CROSSING DISTINCT INDIVIDUALS.In all the foregoing experiments the crossed plants were the product ofa cross between distinct plants. I now selected a very vigorous plant inTable 3/20, raised by fertilising a plant of the eighth self-fertilisedgeneration with pollen from the Chelsea stock. Several flowers on thisplant were crossed with pollen from other flowers on the same plant, andseveral other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen. The seedthus produced was allowed to germinate on bare sand; and the seedlingswere planted in the usual manner on the opposite sides of six pots. Allthe remaining seeds, whether or not in a state of germination, were sownthickly in Pot 7; the three tallest plants on each side of this latterpot being alone measured. As I was in a hurry to learn the result, someof these seeds were sown late in the autumn, but the plants grew soirregularly during the winter, that one crossed plant was 28 1/2 inches,and two others only 4, or less than 4 inches in height, as may be seenin Table 3/21. Under such circumstances, as I have observed in manyother cases, the result is not in the least trustworthy; nevertheless Ifeel bound to give the measurements.TABLE 3/21.

But if all theplants under ten inches in height are struck out, the ratio of theeleven crossed plants to the eight self-fertilised plants is as 100 to82.On the following spring, some remaining seeds of the two lots weretreated in exactly the same manner; and the measurements of theseedlings are given in Table 3/22.TABLE 3/22.

All the plants, except the crowdedones in Pot 8, after being measured were cut down, and the eighteencrossed plants weighed 10 ounces, whilst the same number ofself-fertilised plants weighed 10 1/4 ounces, or as 100 to 102.5; but ifthe dwarfed plants in Pot 7 had been excluded, the self-fertilised wouldhave exceeded the crossed in weight in a higher ratio. In all theprevious experiments in which seedlings were raised from a cross betweendistinct plants, and were put into competition with self-fertilisedplants, the former generally flowered first; but in the present case, inseven out of the eight pots a self-fertilised plant flowered before acrossed one on the opposite side. Considering all the evidence withrespect to the plants in Table3/ 22, a cross between two flowers on thesame plant seems to give no advantage to the offspring thus produced,the self-fertilised plants being in weight superior. But this conclusioncannot be absolutely trusted, owing to the measurements given in Table3/21, though these latter, from the cause already assigned, are verymuch less trustworthy than the present ones.]SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS ON Mimulus luteus.In the three first generations of crossed and self-fertilised plants,the tallest plants alone on each side of the several pots were measured;and the average height of the ten crossed to that of the tenself-fertilised plants was as 100 to 64. The crossed were also much morefertile than the self-fertilised, and so much more vigorous that theyexceeded them in height, even when sown on the opposite side of the samepot after an interval of four days. The same superiority was likewiseshown in a remarkable manner when both kinds of seeds were sown on theopposite sides of a pot with very poor earth full of the roots ofanother plant. In one instance crossed and self-fertilised seedlings,grown in rich soil and not put into competition with each other,attained to an equal height. When we come to the fourth generation thetwo tallest crossed plants taken together exceeded by only a little thetwo tallest self-fertilised plants, and one of the latter beat itscrossed opponent,--a circumstance which had not occurred in the previousgenerations. This victorious self-fertilised plant consisted of a newwhite-flowered variety, which grew taller than the old yellowishvarieties. From the first it seemed to be rather more fertile, whenself-fertilised, than the old varieties, and in the succeedingself-fertilised generations became more and more self-fertile. In thesixth generation the self-fertilised plants of this variety comparedwith the crossed plants produced capsules in the proportion of 147 to100, both lots being allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously. Inthe seventh generation twenty flowers on one of these plantsartificially self-fertilised yielded no less than nineteen very finecapsules!This variety transmitted its characters so faithfully to all thesucceeding self-fertilised generations, up to the last or ninth, thatall the many plants which were raised presented a complete uniformity ofcharacter; thus offering a remarkable contrast with the seedlings raisedfrom the purchased seeds. Yet this variety retained to the last a latenttendency to produce yellow flowers; for when a plant of the eighthself-fertilised generation was crossed with pollen from ayellow-flowered plant of the Chelsea stock, every single seedling boreyellow flowers. A similar variety, at least in the colour of itsflowers, also appeared amongst the crossed plants of the thirdgeneration. No attention was at first paid to it, and I know not how farit was at first used either for crossing or self-fertilisation. In thefifth generation most of the self-fertilised plants, and in the sixthand all the succeeding generations every single plant consisted of thisvariety; and this no doubt was partly due to its great and increasingself-fertility. On the other hand, it disappeared from amongst thecrossed plants in the later generations; and this was probably due tothe continued intercrossing of the several plants. From the tallness ofthis variety, the self-fertilised plants exceeded the crossed plants inheight in all the generations from the fifth to the seventh inclusive;and no doubt would have done so in the later generations, had they beengrown in competition with one another. In the fifth generation thecrossed plants were in height to the self-fertilised, as 100 to 126; inthe sixth, as 100 to 147; and in the seventh generation, as 100 to 137.This excess of height may be attributed not only to this varietynaturally growing taller than the other plants, but to its possessing apeculiar constitution, so that it did not suffer from continuedself-fertilisation.This variety presents a strikingly analogous case to that of the plantcalled the Hero, which appeared in the sixth self-fertilised generationof Ipomoea. If the seeds produced by Hero had been as greatly in excessof those produced by the other plants, as was the case with Mimulus, andif all the seeds had been mingled together, the offspring of Hero wouldhave increased to the entire exclusion of the ordinary plants in thelater self-fertilised generations, and from naturally growing tallerwould have exceeded the crossed plants in height in each succeedinggeneration.Some of the self-fertilised plants of the sixth generation wereintercrossed, as were some in the eighth generation; and the seedlingsfrom these crosses were grown in competition with self-fertilised plantsof the two corresponding generations. In the first trial theintercrossed plants were less fertile than the self-fertilised, and lesstall in the ratio of 100 to 110. In the second trial, the intercrossedplants were more fertile than the self-fertilised in the ratio of 100 to73, and taller in the ratio of 100 to 92. Notwithstanding that theself-fertilised plants in the second trial were the product of twoadditional generations of self-fertilisation, I cannot understand thisdiscordance in the results of the two analogous experiments.The most important of all the experiments on Mimulus are those in whichflowers on plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation were againself-fertilised; other flowers on distinct plants of the same lot wereintercrossed; and others were crossed with a new stock of plants fromChelsea. The Chelsea-crossed seedlings were to the intercrossed inheight as 100 to 56, and in fertility as 100 to 4; and they were to theself-fertilised plants, in height as 100 to 52, and in fertility as 100to 3. These Chelsea-crossed plants were also much more hardy than theplants of the other two lots; so that altogether the gain from the crosswith a fresh stock was wonderfully great.Lastly, seedlings raised from a cross between flowers on the same plantwere not superior to those from flowers fertilised with their ownpollen; but this result cannot be absolutely trusted, owing to someprevious observations, which, however, were made under very unfavourablecircumstances.[Digitalis purpurea.The flowers of the common Foxglove are proterandrous; that is, thepollen is mature and mostly shed before the stigma of the same flower isready for fertilisation. This is effected by the larger humble-bees,which, whilst in search of nectar, carry pollen from flower to flower.The two upper and longer stamens shed their pollen before the two lowerand shorter ones. The meaning of this fact probably is, as Dr. Ogleremarks, that the anthers of the longer stamens stand near to thestigma, so that they would be the most likely to fertilise it (3/3.'Popular Science Review' January 1870 page 50.); and as it is anadvantage to avoid self-fertilisation, they shed their pollen first,thus lessening the chance. There is, however, but little danger ofself-fertilisation until the bifid stigma opens; for Hildebrand foundthat pollen placed on the stigma before it had opened produced noeffect. (3/4. 'Geschlechter-Vertheilung bei den Pflanzen' 1867 page 20.)The anthers, which are large, stand at first transversely with respectto the tubular corolla, and if they were to dehisce in this positionthey would, as Dr. Ogle also remarks, smear with pollen the whole backand sides of an entering humble-bee in a useless manner; but the antherstwist round and place themselves longitudinally before they dehisce. Thelower and inner side of the mouth of the corolla is thickly clothed withhairs, and these collect so much of the fallen pollen that I have seenthe under surface of a humble-bee thickly dusted with it; but this cannever be applied to the stigma, as the bees in retreating do not turntheir under surfaces upwards. I was therefore puzzled whether thesehairs were of any use; but Mr. Belt has, I think, explained their use:the smaller kinds of bees are not fitted to fertilise the flowers, andif they were allowed to enter easily they would steal much nectar, andfewer large bees would haunt the flowers. Humble-bees can crawl into thedependent flowers with the greatest ease, using the "hairs as footholdswhile sucking the honey; but the smaller bees are impeded by them, andwhen, having at length struggled through them, they reach the slipperyprecipice above, they are completely baffled." Mr. Belt says that hewatched many flowers during a whole season in North Wales, and "onlyonce saw a small bee reach the nectary, though many were seen trying invain to do so." (3/5. 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 132. Butit appears from H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' 1873 page 285,that small insects sometimes succeed in entering the flowers.)I covered a plant growing in its native soil in North Wales with a net,and fertilised six flowers each with its own pollen, and six others withpollen from a distinct plant growing within the distance of a few feet.The covered plant was occasionally shaken with violence, so as toimitate the effects of a gale of wind, and thus to facilitate as far aspossible self-fertilisation. It bore ninety-two flowers (besides thedozen artificially fertilised), and of these only twenty-four producedcapsules; whereas almost all the flowers on the surrounding uncoveredplants were fruitful. Of the twenty-four spontaneously self-fertilisedcapsules, only two contained their full complement of seed; sixcontained a moderate supply; and the remaining sixteen extremely fewseeds. A little pollen adhering to the anthers after they had dehisced,and accidentally falling on the stigma when mature, must have been themeans by which the above twenty-four flowers were partiallyself-fertilised; for the margins of the corolla in withering do not curlinwards, nor do the flowers in dropping off turn round on their axes, soas to bring the pollen-covered hairs, with which the lower surface isclothed, into contact with the stigma--by either of which meansself-fertilisation might be effected.Seeds from the above crossed and self-fertilised capsules, aftergerminating on bare sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides offive moderately-sized pots, which were kept in the greenhouse. Theplants after a time appeared starved, and were therefore, without beingdisturbed, turned out of their pots, and planted in the open ground intwo close parallel rows. They were thus subjected to tolerably severecompetition with one another; but not nearly so severe as if they hadbeen left in the pots. At the time when they were turned out, theirleaves were between 5 and 8 inches in length, and the longest leaf onthe finest plant on each side of each pot was measured, with the resultthat the leaves of the crossed plants exceeded, on an average, those ofthe self-fertilised plants by .4 of an inch.In the following summer the tallest flower-stem on each plant, whenfully grown, was measured. There were seventeen crossed plants; but onedid not produce a flower-stem. There were also, originally, seventeenself-fertilised plants, but these had such poor constitutions that noless than nine died in the course of the winter and spring, leaving onlyeight to be measured, as in Table 3/23.TABLE 3/23. Digitalis purpurea.The tallest Flower-stem on each Plant measured in inches: 0 means thatthe Plant died before a Flower-stem was produced.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3:  Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  53 6/8 :  27 4/8.Pot 1  :  57 4/8 :  55 6/8.Pot 1  :  57 6/8 :   0.Pot 1  :  65     :   0.Pot 2  :  34 4/8 :  39.Pot 2  :  52 4/8 :  32.Pot 2  :  63 6/8 :  21.Pot 3  :  57 4/8 :  53 4/8.Pot 3  :  53 4/8 :   0.Pot 3  :  50 6/8 :   0.Pot 3  :  37 2/8 :   0.Pot 4  :  64 4/8 :  34 4/8.Pot 4  :  37 4/8 :  23 6/8.Pot 4  :  --     :   0.Pot 5  :  53     :   0.Pot 5  :  47 6/8 :   0.Pot 5  :  34 6/8 :   0.Total  : 821.25  : 287.00.The average height of the flower-stems of the sixteen crossed plants ishere 51.33 inches; and that of the eight self-fertilised plants, 35.87;or as 100 to 70. But this difference in height does not give at all afair idea of the vast superiority of the crossed plants. These latterproduced altogether sixty-four flower-stems, each plant producing, on anaverage, exactly four flower-stems, whereas the eight self-fertilisedplants produced only fifteen flower-stems, each producing an averageonly of 1.87 stems, and these had a less luxuriant appearance. We mayput the result in another way: the number of flower-stems on the crossedplants was to those on an equal number of self-fertilised plants as 100to 48.Three crossed seeds in a state of germination were also planted in threeseparate pots; and three self-fertilised seeds in the same state inthree other pots. These plants were therefore at first exposed to nocompetition with one another, and when turned out of their pots into theopen ground they were planted at a moderate distance apart, so that theywere exposed to much less severe competition than in the last case. Thelongest leaves on the three crossed plants, when turned out, exceededthose on the self-fertilised plants by a mere trifle, namely, on anaverage by .17 of an inch. When fully grown the three crossed plantsproduced twenty-six flower-stems; the two tallest of which on each plantwere on an average 54.04 inches in height. The three self-fertilisedplants produced twenty-three flower-stems, the two tallest of which oneach plant had an average height of 46.18 inches. So that the differencebetween these two lots, which hardly competed together, is much lessthan in the last case when there was moderately severe competition,namely, as 100 to 85, instead of as 100 to 70.THE EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING OF INTERCROSSING DIFFERENT FLOWERS ON THESAME PLANT, INSTEAD OF CROSSING DISTINCT INDIVIDUALS.A fine plant growing in my garden (one of the foregoing seedlings) wascovered with a net, and six flowers were crossed with pollen fromanother flower on the same plant, and six others were fertilised withtheir own pollen. All produced good capsules. The seeds from each wereplaced in separate watch-glasses, and no difference could be perceivedby the eye between the two lots of seeds; and when they were weighedthere was no difference of any significance, as the seeds from theself-fertilised capsules weighed 7.65 grains, whilst those from thecrossed capsules weighed 7.7 grains. Therefore the sterility of thepresent species, when insects are excluded, is not due to the impotenceof pollen on the stigma of the same flower. Both lots of seeds andseedlings were treated in exactly the same manner as in Table 3/23,excepting that after the pairs of germinating seeds had been planted onthe opposite sides of eight pots, all the remaining seeds were thicklysown on the opposite sides of Pots 9 and 10 in Table 3/24. The youngplants during the following spring were turned out of their pots,without being disturbed, and planted in the open ground in two rows, notvery close together, so that they were subjected to only moderatelysevere competition with one another. Very differently to what occurredin the first experiment, when the plants were subjected to somewhatsevere mutual competition, an equal number on each side either died ordid not produce flower-stems. The tallest flower-stems on the survivingplants were measured, as shown in Table 3/24.TABLE 3/24.

In order totest this result, the plants planted in pairs in Pots 1 and 8 wereconsidered by themselves, and the average height of the sixteen crossedplants is here 44.9, and that of the sixteen self-fertilised plants42.03, or as 100 to 94. Again, the plants raised from the thickly sownseed in Pots 9 and 10, which were subjected to very severe mutualcompetition, were taken by themselves, and the average height of thenine crossed plants is 39.86, and that of the nine self-fertilisedplants 35.88, or as 100 to 90. The plants in these two latter pots (9and 10), after being measured, were cut down close to the ground andweighed: the nine crossed plants weighed 57.66 ounces, and the nineself-fertilised plants 45.25 ounces, or as 100 to 78. On the whole wemay conclude, especially from the evidence of weight, that seedlingsfrom a cross between flowers on the same plant have a decided, thoughnot great, advantage over those from flowers fertilised with their ownpollen, more especially in the case of the plants subjected to severemutual competition. But the advantage is much less than that exhibitedby the crossed offspring of distinct plants, for these exceeded theself-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 70, and in the number offlower-stems as 100 to 48. Digitalis thus differs from Ipomoea, andalmost certainly from Mimulus, as with these two species a cross betweenflowers on the same plant did no good.CALCEOLARIA.A BUSHY GREENHOUSE VARIETY, WITH YELLOW FLOWERS BLOTCHED WITH PURPLE.The flowers in this genus are constructed so as to favour or almostensure cross-fertilisation (3/6. Hildebrand as quoted by H. Muller 'DieBefruchtung der Blumen' 1873 page 277.); and Mr. Anderson remarks thatextreme care is necessary to exclude insects in order to preserve anykind true. (3/7. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1853 page 534.) He adds theinteresting statement, that when the corolla is cut quite away, insects,as far as he has seen, never discover or visit the flowers. This plantis, however, self-fertile if insects are excluded. So few experimentswere made by me, that they are hardly worth giving. Crossed andself-fertilised seeds were sown on opposite sides of a pot, and after atime the crossed seedlings slightly exceeded the self-fertilised inheight. When a little further grown, the longest leaves on the formerwere very nearly 3 inches in length, whilst those on the self-fertilisedplants were only 2 inches. Owing to an accident, and to the pot beingtoo small, only one plant on each side grew up and flowered; the crossedplant was 19 1/2 inches in height, and the self-fertilised one 15inches; or as 100 to 77.Linaria vulgaris.It has been mentioned in the introductory chapter that two large beds ofthis plant were raised by me many years ago from crossed andself-fertilised seeds, and that there was a conspicuous difference inheight and general appearance between the two lots. The trial wasafterwards repeated with more care; but as this was one of the firstplants experimented on, my usual method was not followed. Seeds weretaken from wild plants growing in this neighbourhood and sown in poorsoil in my garden. Five plants were covered with a net, the others beingleft exposed to the bees, which incessantly visit the flowers of thisspecies, and which, according to H. Muller, are the exclusivefertilisers. This excellent observer remarks that, as the stigma liesbetween the anthers and is mature at the same time with them,self-fertilisation is possible. (3/8. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 279.)But so few seeds are produced by protected plants, that the pollen andstigma of the same flower seem to have little power of mutualinteraction. The exposed plants bore numerous capsules forming solidspikes. Five of these capsules were examined and appeared to contain anequal number of seeds; and these being counted in one capsule, werefound to be 166. The five protected plants produced altogether onlytwenty-five capsules, of which five were much finer than all the others,and these contained an average of 23.6 seeds, with a maximum in onecapsule of fifty-five. So that the number of seeds in the capsules onthe exposed plants to the average number in the finest capsules on theprotected plants was as 100 to 14.Some of the spontaneously self-fertilised seeds from under the net, andsome seeds from the uncovered plants naturally fertilised and almostcertainly intercrossed by the bees, were sown separately in two largepots of the same size; so that the two lots of seedlings were notsubjected to any mutual competition. Three of the crossed plants when infull flower were measured, but no care was taken to select the tallestplants; their heights were 7 4/8, 7 2/8, and 6 4/8 inches; averaging7.08 in height. The three tallest of all the self-fertilised plants werethen carefully selected, and their heights were 6 3/8, 5 5/8, and 5 2/8,averaging 5.75 in height. So that the naturally crossed plants were tothe spontaneously self-fertilised plants in height, at least as much as100 to 81.Verbascum thapsus.The flowers of this plant are frequented by various insects, chiefly bybees, for the sake of the pollen. Hermann Muller, however, has shown('Die Befruchtung' etc. page 277) that V. nigrum secretes minute dropsof nectar. The arrangement of the reproductive organs, though not at allcomplex, favours cross-fertilisation; and even distinct species areoften crossed, for a greater number of naturally produced hybrids havebeen observed in this genus than in almost any other. (3/9. I have givena striking case of a large number of such hybrids between Verbascumthapsus and lychnitis found growing wild: 'Journal of Linnean SocietyBotany' volume 10 page 451.) Nevertheless the present species isperfectly self-fertile, if insects are excluded; for a plant protectedby a net was as thickly loaded with fine capsules as the surroundinguncovered plants. Verbascum lychnitis is rather less self-fertile, forsome protected plants did not yield quite so many capsules as theadjoining uncovered plants.Plants of Verbascum thapsus had been raised for a distinct purpose fromself-fertilised seeds; and some flowers on these plants were againself-fertilised, yielding seed of the second self-fertilised generation;and other flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant. Theseeds thus produced were sown on the opposite sides of four large pots.They germinated, however, so irregularly (the crossed seedlingsgenerally coming up first) that I was able to save only six pairs ofequal age. These when in full flower were measured, as in Table 3/25.TABLE 3/25. Verbascum thapsus.Heights of Plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3:  Self-fertilised Plants of the Second Generation.Pot 1  :  76 :  53 4/8.Pot 2  :  54 :  66.Pot 3  :  62 :  75.Pot 3  :  60 5/8 :   30 4/8.Pot 4  :  73 :  62.Pot 4  :  66 4/8 :  52.Total  : 392.13  : 339.00.We here see that two of the self-fertilised plants exceed in heighttheir crossed opponents. Nevertheless the average height of the sixcrossed plants is 65.34 inches, and that of the six self-fertilisedplants 56.5 inches; or as 100 to 86.Vandellia nummularifolia.Seeds were sent to me by Mr. J. Scott from Calcutta of this small Indianweed, which bears perfect and cleistogene flowers. (3/10. The convenientterm of CLEISTOGENE was proposed by Kuhn in an article on the presentgenus in 'Bot. Zeitung' 1867 page 65.) The latter are extremely small,imperfectly developed, and never expand, yet yield plenty of seeds. Theperfect and open flowers are also small, of a white colour with purplemarks; they generally produce seed, although the contrary has beenasserted; and they do so even if protected from insects. They have arather complicated structure, and appear to be adapted forcross-fertilisation, but were not carefully examined by me. They are noteasy to fertilise artificially, and it is possible that some of theflowers which I thought that I had succeeded in crossing were afterwardsspontaneously self-fertilised under the net. Sixteen capsules from thecrossed perfect flowers contained on an average ninety-three seeds (witha maximum in one capsule of 137), and thirteen capsules from theself-fertilised perfect flowers contained sixty-two seeds (with amaximum in one capsule of 135); or as 100 to 67. But I suspect that thisconsiderable excess was accidental, as on one occasion nine crossedcapsules were compared with seven self-fertilised capsules (bothincluded in the above number), and they contained almost exactly thesame average number of seed. I may add that fifteen capsules fromself-fertilised cleistogene flowers contained on an average sixty-fourseeds, with a maximum in one of eighty-seven.Crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the perfect flowers, and otherseeds from the self-fertilised cleistogene flowers, were sown in fivepots, each divided superficially into three compartments. The seedlingswere thinned at an early age, so that twenty plants were left in each ofthe three divisions. The crossed plants when in full flower averaged 4.3inches, and the self-fertilised plants from the perfect flowers 4.27inches in height; or as 100 to 99. The self-fertilised plants from thecleistogene flowers averaged 4.06 inches in height; so that the crossedwere in height to these latter plants as 100 to 94.I determined to compare again the growth of plants raised from crossedand self-fertilised perfect flowers, and obtained two fresh lots ofseeds. These were sown on opposite sides of five pots, but they were notsufficiently thinned, so that they grew rather crowded. When fullygrown, all those above 2 inches in height were selected, all below thisstandard being rejected; the former consisted of forty-seven crossed andforty-one self-fertilised plants; thus a greater number of the crossedthan of the self-fertilised plants grew to a height of above 2 inches.Of the crossed plants, the twenty-four tallest were on an average 3.6inches in height; whilst the twenty-four tallest self-fertilised plantswere 3.38 inches in average height; or as 100 to 94. All these plantswere then cut down close to the ground, and the forty-seven crossedplants weighed 1090.3 grains, and the forty-one self-fertilised plantsweighed 887.4 grains. Therefore an equal number of crossed andself-fertilised would have been to each other in weight as 100 to 97.From these several facts we may conclude that the crossed plants hadsome real, though very slight, advantage in height and weight over theself-fertilised plants, when grown in competition with one another.The crossed plants were, however, inferior in fertility to theself-fertilised. Six of the finest plants were selected out of theforty-seven crossed plants, and six out of the forty-one self-fertilisedplants; and the former produced 598 capsules, whilst the latter orself-fertilised plants produced 752 capsules. All these capsules werethe product of cleistogene flowers, for the plants did not bear duringthe whole of this season any perfect flowers. The seeds were counted inten cleistogene capsules produced by crossed plants, and their averagenumber was 46.4 per capsule; whilst the number in ten cleistogenecapsules produced by the self-fertilised plants was 49.4; or as 100 to106.3. GESNERIACEAE.--Gesneria pendulina.In Gesneria the several parts of the flower are arranged on nearly thesame plan as in Digitalis, and most or all of the species aredichogamous. (3/11. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' January 1870 page51.) Plants were raised from seed sent me by Fritz Muller from SouthBrazil. Seven flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant,and produced seven capsules containing by weight 3.01 grains of seeds.Seven flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen,and their seven capsules contained exactly the same weight of seeds.Germinating seeds were planted on opposite sides of four pots, and whenfully grown measured to the tips of their leaves.TABLE 3/26. Gesneria pendulina.Heights of Plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3:  Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  42 2/8 :  39.Pot 1  :  24 4/8 :  27 3/8.Pot 2  :  33 :  30 6/8.Pot 2  :  27 :  19 2/8.Pot 3  :  33 4/8 :  31 7/8.Pot 3  :  29 4/8 :  28 6/8.Pot 4  :  30 6/8 :  29 6/8.Pot 4  :  36     :  26 3/8.Total  : 256.50  : 233.13.The average height of the eight crossed plants is 32.06 inches, and thatof the eight self-fertilised plants 29.14; or as 100 to 90.4. LABIATAE.--Salvia coccinea. (3/12. The admirable mechanicaladaptations in this genus for favouring or ensuring cross-fertilisation,have been fully described by Sprengel, Hildebrand, Delpino, H. Muller,Ogle, and others, in their several works.)This species, unlike most of the others in the same genus, yields a goodmany seeds when insects are excluded. I gathered ninety-eight capsulesproduced by flowers spontaneously self-fertilised under a net, and theycontained on an average 1.45 seeds, whilst flowers artificiallyfertilised with their own pollen, in which case the stigma will havereceived plenty of pollen, yielded on an average 3.3 seeds, or more thantwice as many. Twenty flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinctplant, and twenty-six were self-fertilised. There was no greatdifference in the proportional number of flowers which produced capsulesby these two processes, or in the number of the contained seeds, or inthe weight of an equal number of seeds.Seeds of both kinds were sown rather thickly on opposite sides of threepots. When the seedlings were about 3 inches in height, the crossedshowed a slight advantage over the self-fertilised. When two-thirdsgrown, the two tallest plants on each side of each pot were measured;the crossed averaged 16.37 inches, and the self-fertilised 11.75 inheight; or as 100 to 71. When the plants were fully grown and had doneflowering, the two tallest plants on each side were again measured, withthe results shown in Table 3/27.TABLE 3/27. Salvia coccinea.Heights of Plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  32 6/8 :  25.Pot 1  :  20     :  18 6/8.Pot 2  :  32 3/8 :  20 6/8.Pot 2  :  24 4/8 :  19 4/8.Pot 3  :  29 4/8 :  25.Pot 3  :  28     :  18.Total  : 167.13  : 127.00.It may be here seen that each of the six tallest crossed plants exceedsin height its self-fertilised opponent; the former averaged 27.85inches, whilst the six tallest self-fertilised plants averaged 21.16inches; or as 100 to 76. In all three pots the first plant whichflowered was a crossed one. All the crossed plants together produced 409flowers, whilst all the self-fertilised together produced only 232flowers; or as 100 to 57. So that the crossed plants in this respectwere far more productive than the self-fertilised.Origanum vulgare.This plant exists, according to H. Muller, under two forms; onehermaphrodite and strongly proterandrous, so that it is almost certainto be fertilised by pollen from another flower; the other form isexclusively female, has a smaller corolla, and must of course befertilised by pollen from a distinct plant in order to yield any seeds.The plants on which I experimented were hermaphrodites; they had beencultivated for a long period as a pot-herb in my kitchen garden, andwere, like so many long-cultivated plants, extremely sterile. As I feltdoubtful about the specific name I sent specimens to Kew, and wasassured that the species was Origanum vulgare. My plants formed onegreat clump, and had evidently spread from a single root by stolons. Ina strict sense, therefore, they all belonged to the same individual. Myobject in experimenting on them was, firstly, to ascertain whethercrossing flowers borne by plants having distinct roots, but all derivedasexually from the same individual, would be in any respect moreadvantageous than self-fertilisation; and, secondly, to raise for futuretrial seedlings which would constitute really distinct individuals.Several plants in the above clump were covered by a net, and about twodozen seeds (many of which, however, were small and withered) wereobtained from the flowers thus spontaneously self-fertilised. Theremainder of the plants were left uncovered and were incessantly visitedby bees, so that they were doubtless crossed by them. These exposedplants yielded rather more and finer seed (but still very few) than didthe covered plants. The two lots of seeds thus obtained were sown onopposite sides of two pots; the seedlings were carefully observed fromtheir first growth to maturity, but they did not differ at any period inheight or in vigour, the importance of which latter observation we shallpresently see. When fully grown, the tallest crossed plant in one potwas a very little taller than the tallest self-fertilised plant on theopposite side, and in the other pot exactly the reverse occurred. Sothat the two lots were in fact equal; and a cross of this kind did nomore good than crossing two flowers on the same plant of Ipomoea orMimulus.The plants were turned out of the two pots without being disturbed andplanted in the open ground, in order that they might grow morevigorously. In the following summer all the self-fertilised and some ofthe quasi-crossed plants were covered by a net. Many flowers on thelatter were crossed by me with pollen from a distinct plant, and otherswere left to be crossed by the bees. These quasi-crossed plants producedrather more seed than did the original ones in the great clump when leftto the action of the bees. Many flowers on the self-fertilised plantswere artificially self-fertilised, and others were allowed to fertilisethemselves spontaneously under the net, but they yielded altogether veryfew seeds. These two lots of seeds--the product of a cross betweendistinct seedlings, instead of as in the last case between plantsmultiplied by stolons, and the product of self-fertilised flowers--wereallowed to germinate on bare sand, and several equal pairs were plantedon opposite sides of two LARGE pots. At a very early age the crossedplants showed some superiority over the self-fertilised, which was everafterwards retained. When the plants were fully grown, the two tallestcrossed and the two tallest self-fertilised plants in each pot weremeasured, as shown in Table 3/28. I regret that from want of time I didnot measure all the pairs; but the tallest on each side seemed fairly torepresent the average difference between the two lots.TABLE 3/28. Origanum vulgare.Heights of Plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants (two tallest in each pot).Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants (two tallest in each pot).Pot 1  : 26   : 24.Pot 1  : 21   : 21.Pot 2  : 17   : 12.Pot 2  : 16   : 11 4/8.Total  : 80.0 : 68.5.The average height of the crossed plants is here 20 inches, and that ofthe self-fertilised 17.12; or as 100 to 86. But this excess of height byno means gives a fair idea of the vast superiority in vigour of thecrossed over the self-fertilised plants. The crossed flowered first andproduced thirty flower-stems, whilst the self-fertilised produced onlyfifteen, or half the number. The pots were then bedded out, and theroots probably came out of the holes at the bottom and thus aided theirgrowth. Early in the following summer the superiority of the crossedplants, owing to their increase by stolons, over the self-fertilisedplants was truly wonderful. In Pot 1, and it should be remembered thatvery large pots had been used, the oval clump of crossed plants was 10by 4 1/2 inches across, with the tallest stem, as yet young, 5 1/2inches in height; whilst the clump of self-fertilised plants, on theopposite side of the same pot, was only 3 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches across,with the tallest young stem 4 inches in height. In Pot 2, the clump ofcrossed plants was 18 by 9 inches across, with the tallest young stem 81/2 inches in height; whilst the clump of self-fertilised plants on theopposite side of the same pot was 12 by 4 1/2 inches across, with thetallest young stem 6 inches in height. The crossed plants during thisseason, as during the last, flowered first. Both the crossed andself-fertilised plants being left freely exposed to the visits of bees,manifestly produced much more seed than their grand-parents,--the plantsof the original clump still growing close by in the same garden, andequally left to the action of the bees.5. ACANTHACEAE.--Thunbergia alata.It appears from Hildebrand's description ('Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page285) that the conspicuous flowers of this plant are adapted forcross-fertilisation. Seedlings were twice raised from purchased seed;but during the early summer, when first experimented on, they wereextremely sterile, many of the anthers containing hardly any pollen.Nevertheless, during the autumn these same plants spontaneously produceda good many seeds. Twenty-six flowers during the two years were crossedwith pollen from a distinct plant, but they yielded only elevencapsules; and these contained very few seeds! Twenty-eight flowers werefertilised with pollen from the same flower, and these yielded only tencapsules, which, however, contained rather more seed than the crossedcapsules. Eight pairs of germinating seeds were planted on oppositesides of five pots; and exactly half the crossed and half theself-fertilised plants exceeded their opponents in height. Two of theself-fertilised plants died young, before they were measured, and theircrossed opponents were thrown away. The six remaining pairs of thesegrew very unequally, some, both of the crossed and self-fertilisedplants, being more than twice as tall as the others. The average heightof the crossed plants was 60 inches, and that of the self-fertilisedplants 65 inches, or as 100 to 108. A cross, therefore, between distinctindividuals here appears to do no good; but this result deduced from sofew plants in a very sterile condition and growing very unequally,obviously cannot be trusted.]CHAPTER IV.CRUCIFERAE, PAPAVERACEAE, RESEDACEAE, ETC.Brassica oleracea, crossed and self-fertilised plants.Great effect of a cross with a fresh stock on the weight of theoffspring.Iberis umbellata.Papaver vagum.Eschscholtzia californica, seedlings from a cross with a fresh stock notmore vigorous, but more fertile than the self-fertilised seedlings.Reseda lutea and odorata, many individuals sterile with their own pollen.Viola tricolor, wonderful effects of a cross.Adonis aestivalis.Delphinium consolida.Viscaria oculata, crossed plants hardly taller, but more fertile thanthe self-fertilised.Dianthus caryophyllus, crossed and self-fertilised plants compared forfour generations.Great effects of a cross with a fresh stock.Uniform colour of the flowers on the self-fertilised plants.Hibiscus africanus.[6. CRUCIFERAE.--Brassica oleracea.VAR. CATTELL'S EARLY BARNES CABBAGE.The flowers of the common cabbage are adapted, as shown by H. Muller,for cross-fertilisation, and should this fail, for self-fertilisation.(4/1. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 139.) It is well known that thevarieties are crossed so largely by insects, that it is impossible toraise pure kinds in the same garden, if more than one kind is in flowerat the same time. Cabbages, in one respect, were not well fitted for myexperiments, as, after they had formed heads, they were often difficultto measure. The flower-stems also differ much in height; and a poorplant will sometimes throw up a higher stem than that of a fine plant.In the later experiments, the fully-grown plants were cut down andweighed, and then the immense advantage from a cross became manifest.A single plant of the above variety was covered with a net just beforeflowering, and was crossed with pollen from another plant of the samevariety growing close by; and the seven capsules thus produced containedon an average 16.3 seeds, with a maximum of twenty in one capsule. Someflowers were artificially self-fertilised, but their capsules did notcontain so many seeds as those from flowers spontaneouslyself-fertilised under the net, of which a considerable number wereproduced. Fourteen of these latter capsules contained on an average 4.1seeds, with a maximum in one of ten seeds; so that the seeds in thecrossed capsules were in number to those in the self-fertilised capsulesas 100 to 25. The self-fertilised seeds, fifty-eight of which weighed3.88 grains, were, however, a little finer than those from the crossedcapsules, fifty-eight of which weighed 3.76 grains. When few seeds areproduced, these seem often to be better nourished and to be heavier thanwhen many are produced.The two lots of seeds in an equal state of germination were planted,some on opposite sides of a single pot, and some in the open ground. Theyoung crossed plants in the pot at first exceeded by a little in heightthe self-fertilised; then equalled them; were then beaten; and lastlywere again victorious. The plants, without being disturbed, were turnedout of the pot, and planted in the open ground; and after growing forsome time, the crossed plants, which were all of nearly the same height,exceeded the self-fertilised ones by 2 inches. When they flowered, theflower-stems of the tallest crossed plant exceeded that of the tallestself-fertilised plant by 6 inches. The other seedlings which wereplanted in the open ground stood separate, so that they did not competewith one another; nevertheless the crossed plants certainly grew to arather greater height than the self-fertilised; but no measurements weremade. The crossed plants which had been raised in the pot, and thoseplanted in the open ground, all flowered a little before theself-fertilised plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.Some flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation were againcrossed with pollen from another crossed plant, and produced finecapsules. The flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the lastgeneration were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under anet, and they produced some remarkably fine capsules. The two lots ofseeds thus produced germinated on sand, and eight pairs were planted onopposite sides of four pots. These plants were measured to the tips oftheir leaves on the 20th of October of the same year, and the eightcrossed plants averaged in height 8.4 inches, whilst the self-fertilisedaveraged 8.53 inches, so that the crossed were a little inferior inheight, as 100 to 101.5. By the 5th of June of the following year theseplants had grown much bulkier, and had begun to form heads. The crossedhad now acquired a marked superiority in general appearance, andaveraged 8.02 inches in height, whilst the self-fertilised averaged 7.31inches; or as 100 to 91. The plants were then turned out of their potsand planted undisturbed in the open ground. By the 5th of August theirheads were fully formed, but several had grown so crooked that theirheights could hardly be measured with accuracy. The crossed plants,however, were on the whole considerably taller than the self-fertilised.In the following year they flowered; the crossed plants flowering beforethe self-fertilised in three of the pots, and at the same time in Pot 2.The flower-stems were now measured, as shown in Table 4/29.TABLE 3/29. Brassica oleracea.Measured in inches to tops of flower-stems: 0 signifies that aFlower-stem was not formed.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  49 2/8 :  44.Pot 1  :  39 4/8 :  41.Pot 2  :  37 4/8 :  38.Pot 2  :  33 4/8 :  35 4/8.Pot 3  :  47     :  51 1/8.Pot 3  :  40     :  41 2/8.Pot 3  :  42     :  46 4/8.Pot 4  :  43 6/8 :  20 2/8.Pot 4  :  37 2/8 :  33 3/8.Pot 4  :   0     :   0.Total  : 369.75  : 351.00.The nine flower-stems on the crossed plants here average 41.08 inches,and the nine on the self-fertilised plants 39 inches in height, or as100 to 95. But this small difference, which, moreover, depended almostwholly on one of the self-fertilised plants being only 20 inches high,does not in the least show the vast superiority of the crossed over theself-fertilised plants. Both lots, including the two plants in Pot 4,which did not flower, were now cut down close to the ground and weighed,but those in Pot 2 were excluded, for they had been accidentally injuredby a fall during transplantation, and one was almost killed. The eightcrossed plants weighed 219 ounces, whilst the eight self-fertilisedplants weighed only 82 ounces, or as 100 to 37; so that the superiorityof the former over the latter in weight was great.THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK.Some flowers on a crossed plant of the last or second generation werefertilised, without being castrated, by pollen taken from a plant of thesame variety, but not related to my plants, and brought from a nurserygarden (whence my seeds originally came) having a different soil andaspect. The flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the last or secondgeneration (Table 4/29) were allowed to fertilise themselvesspontaneously under a net, and yielded plenty of seeds. These latter andthe crossed seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs onthe opposite sides of six large pots, which were kept at first in a coolgreenhouse. Early in January their heights were measured to the tips oftheir leaves. The thirteen crossed plants averaged 13.16 inches inheight, and the twelve (for one had died) self-fertilised plantsaveraged 13.7 inches, or as 100 to 104; so that the self-fertilisedplants exceeded by a little the crossed plants.TABLE 3/30.

By the endof August the greater number had formed fine heads, but several grewextremely crooked, from having been drawn up to the light whilst in thegreenhouse. As it was scarcely possible to measure their heights, thefinest plant on each side of each pot was cut down close to the groundand weighed. In Table 4/30 we have the result.The six finest crossed plants average 108.16 ounces, whilst the sixfinest self-fertilised plants average only 23.7 ounces, or as 100 to 22.This difference shows in the clearest manner the enormous benefit whichthese plants derived from a cross with another plant belonging to thesame sub-variety, but to a fresh stock, and grown during at least thethree previous generations under somewhat different conditions.THE OFFSPRING FROM A CUT-LEAVED, CURLED, AND VARIEGATED WHITE-GREENCABBAGE CROSSED WITH A CUT-LEAVED, CURLED, AND VARIEGATED CRIMSON-GREENCABBAGE, COMPARED WITH THE SELF-FERTILISED OFFSPRING FROM THE TWOVARIETIES.These trials were made, not for the sake of comparing the growth of thecrossed and self-fertilised seedlings, but because I had seen it statedthat these varieties would not naturally intercross when growinguncovered and near one another. This statement proved quite erroneous;but the white-green variety was in some degree sterile in my garden,producing little pollen and few seeds. It was therefore no wonder thatseedlings raised from the self-fertilised flowers of this variety weregreatly exceeded in height by seedlings from a cross between it and themore vigorous crimson-green variety; and nothing more need be said aboutthis experiment.The seedlings from the reciprocal cross, that is, from the crimson-greenvariety fertilised with pollen from the white-green variety, offer asomewhat more curious case. A few of these crossed seedlings reverted toa pure green variety with their leaves less cut and curled, so that theywere altogether in a much more natural state, and these plants grew morevigorously and taller than any of the others. Now it is a strange factthat a much larger number of the self-fertilised seedlings from thecrimson-green variety than of the crossed seedlings thus reverted; andas a consequence the self-fertilised seedlings grew taller by 2 1/2inches on an average than the crossed seedlings, with which they wereput into competition. At first, however, the crossed seedlings exceededthe self-fertilised by an average of a quarter of an inch. We thus seethat reversion to a more natural condition acted more powerfully infavouring the ultimate growth of these plants than did a cross; but itshould be remembered that the cross was with a semi-sterile varietyhaving a feeble constitution.Iberis umbellata.VAR. KERMESIANA.This variety produced plenty of spontaneously self-fertilised seed undera net. Other plants in pots in the greenhouse were left uncovered, andas I saw small flies visiting the flowers, it seemed probable that theywould be intercrossed. Consequently seeds supposed to have been thuscrossed and spontaneously self-fertilised seeds were sown on oppositesides of a pot. The self-fertilised seedlings grew from the firstquicker than the supposed crossed seedlings, and when both lots were infull flower the former were from 5 to 6 inches higher than the crossed!I record in my notes that the self-fertilised seeds from which theseself-fertilised plants were raised were not so well ripened as thecrossed; and this may possibly have caused the great difference in theirgrowth, in a somewhat analogous manner as occurred with theself-fertilised plants of the eighth generation of Ipomoea raised fromunhealthy parents. It is a curious circumstance, that two other lots ofthe above seeds were sown in pure sand mixed with burnt earth, andtherefore without any organic matter; and here the supposed crossedseedlings grew to double the height of the self-fertilised, before bothlots died, as necessarily occurred at an early period. We shallhereafter meet with another case apparently analogous to this of Iberisin the third generation of Petunia.The above self-fertilised plants were allowed to fertilise themselvesagain under a net, yielding self-fertilised plants of the secondgeneration, and the supposed crossed plants were crossed by pollen of adistinct plant; but from want of time this was done in a carelessmanner, namely, by smearing one head of expanded flowers over another. Ishould have thought that this would have succeeded, and perhaps it didso; but the fact of 108 of the self-fertilised seeds weighing 4.87grains, whilst the same number of the supposed crossed seeds weighedonly 3.57 grains, does not look like it. Five seedlings from each lot ofseeds were raised, and the self-fertilised plants, when fully grown,exceeded in average height by a trifle (namely .4 of an inch) the fiveprobably crossed plants. I have thought it right to give this case andthe last, because had the supposed crossed plants proved superior to theself-fertilised in height, I should have assumed without doubt that theformer had really been crossed. As it is, I do not know what toconclude.Being much surprised at the two foregoing trials, I determined to makeanother, in which there should be no doubt about the crossing. Itherefore fertilised with great care (but as usual without castration)twenty-four flowers on the supposed crossed plants of the lastgeneration with pollen from distinct plants, and thus obtainedtwenty-one capsules. The self-fertilised plants of the last generationwere allowed to fertilise themselves again under a net, and theseedlings reared from these seeds formed the third self-fertilisedgeneration. Both lots of seeds, after germinating on bare sand, wereplanted in pairs on the opposite sides of two pots. All the remainingseeds were sown crowded on opposite sides of a third pot; but as all theself-fertilised seedlings in this latter pot died before they grew toany considerable height, they were not measured. The plants in Pots 1and 2 were measured when between 7 and 8 inches in height, and thecrossed exceeded the self-fertilised in average height by 1.57 inches.When fully grown they were again measured to the summits of theirflower-heads, with the following result:--TABLE 4/31. Iberis umbellata.Heights of plants to the summits of their flower-heads, in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3:  Self-fertilised Plants of the Third Generation.Pot 1  :  18     :  19.Pot 1  :  21     :  21.Pot 1  :  18 2/8 :  19 4/8.Pot 2  :  19     :  16 6/8.Pot 2  :  18 4/8 :   7 4/8.Pot 2  :  17 6/8 :  14 4/8.Pot 2  :  21 3/8 :  16 4/8.Total  : 133.88  : 114.75.The average height of the seven crossed plants is here 19.12 inches, andthat of the seven self-fertilised plants 16.39, or as 100 to 86. But asthe plants on the self-fertilised side grew very unequally, this ratiocannot be fully trusted, and is probably too high. In both pots acrossed plant flowered before any one of the self-fertilised. Theseplants were left uncovered in the greenhouse; but from being too muchcrowded they were not very productive. The seeds from all seven plantsof both lots were counted; the crossed produced 206, and theself-fertilised 154; or as 100 to 75.CROSS BY A FRESH STOCK.From the doubts caused by the two first trials, in which it was notknown with certainty that the plants had been crossed; and from thecrossed plants in the last experiment having been put into competitionwith plants self-fertilised for three generations, which moreover grewvery unequally, I resolved to repeat the trial on a larger scale, and ina rather different manner. I obtained seeds of the same crimson varietyof Iberis umbellata from another nursery garden, and raised plants fromthem. Some of these plants were allowed to fertilise themselvesspontaneously under a net; others were crossed by pollen taken fromplants raised from seed sent me by Dr. Durando from Algiers, where theparent-plants had been cultivated for some generations. These latterplants differed in having pale pink instead of crimson flowers, but inno other respect. That the cross had been effective (though the flowerson the crimson mother-plant had NOT been castrated) was well shown whenthe thirty crossed seedlings flowered, for twenty-four of them producedpale pink flowers, exactly like those of their father; the six othershaving crimson flowers exactly like those of their mother and like thoseof all the self-fertilised seedlings. This case offers a good instanceof a result which not rarely follows from crossing varieties havingdifferently coloured flowers; namely, that the colours do not blend, butresemble perfectly those either of the father or mother plant. The seedsof both lots, after germinating on sand, were planted on opposite sidesof eight pots. When fully grown, the plants were measured to the summitsof the flower-heads, as shown in Table 4/32.TABLE 4/32.

I am surprised that the difference did not prove somewhatgreater, considering that in the last experiment it was as 100 to 86;but this latter ratio, as before explained, was probably too great. Itshould, however, be observed that in the last experiment (Table 4/31),the crossed plants competed with plants of the third self-fertilisedgeneration; whilst in the present case, plants derived from a cross witha fresh stock competed with self-fertilised plants of the firstgeneration.The crossed plants in the present case, as in the last, were morefertile than the self-fertilised, both lots being left uncovered in thegreenhouse. The thirty crossed plants produced 103 seed-bearingflowers-heads, as well as some heads which yielded no seeds; whereas thetwenty-nine self-fertilised plants produced only 81 seed-bearing heads;therefore thirty such plants would have produced 83.7 heads. We thus getthe ratio of 100 to 81, for the number of seed-bearing flower-headsproduced by the crossed and self-fertilised plants. Moreover, a numberof seed-bearing heads from the crossed plants, compared with the samenumber from the self-fertilised, yielded seeds by weight, in the ratioof 100 to 92. Combining these two elements, namely, the number ofseed-bearing heads and the weight of seeds in each head, theproductiveness of the crossed to the self-fertilised plants was as 100to 75.The crossed and self-fertilised seeds, which remained after the abovepairs had been planted, (some in a state of germination and some notso), were sown early in the year out of doors in two rows. Many of theself-fertilised seedlings suffered greatly, and a much larger number ofthem perished than of the crossed. In the autumn the survivingself-fertilised plants were plainly less well-grown than the crossedplants.7. PAPAVERACEAE.--Papaver vagum.A SUB-SPECIES OF Papaver dubium, FROM THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.The poppy does not secrete nectar, but the flowers are highlyconspicuous and are visited by many pollen-collecting bees, flies andbeetles. The anthers shed their pollen very early, and in the case ofPapaver rhoeas, it falls on the circumference of the radiating stigmas,so that this species must often be self-fertilised; but with Papaverdubium the same result does not follow (according to H. Muller 'DieBefruchtung' page 128), owing to the shortness of the stamens, unlessthe flower happens to stand inclined. The present species, therefore,does not seem so well fitted for self-fertilisation as most of theothers. Nevertheless Papaver vagum produced plenty of capsules in mygarden when insects were excluded, but only late in the season. I mayhere add that Papaver somniferum produces an abundance of spontaneouslyself-fertilised capsules, as Professor H. Hoffmann likewise found to bethe case. (4/2. 'Zur Speciesfrage' 1875 page 53.) Some species ofPapaver cross freely when growing in the same garden, as I have known tobe the case with Papaver bracteatum and orientale.Plants of Papaver vagum were raised from seeds sent me from Antibesthrough the kindness of Dr. Bornet. Some little time after the flowershad expanded, several were fertilised with their own pollen, and others(not castrated) with pollen from a distinct individual; but I havereason to believe, from observations subsequently made, that theseflowers had been already fertilised by their own pollen, as this processseems to take place soon after their expansion. (4/3. Mr. J. Scott found'Report on the Experimental Culture of the Opium Poppy' Calcutta 1874page 47, in the case of Papaver somniferum, that if he cut away thestigmatic surface before the flower had expanded, no seeds wereproduced; but if this was done "on the second day, or even a few hoursafter the expansion of the flower on the first day, a partialfertilisation had already been effected, and a few good seeds werealmost invariably produced." This proves at how early a periodfertilisation takes place.) I raised, however, a few seedlings of bothlots, and the self-fertilised rather exceeded the crossed plants inheight.Early in the following year I acted differently, and fertilised sevenflowers, very soon after their expansion, with pollen from anotherplant, and obtained six capsules. From counting the seeds in amedium-sized one, I estimated that the average number in each was atleast 120. Four out of twelve capsules, spontaneously self-fertilised atthe same time, were found to contain no good seeds; and the remainingeight contained on an average 6.6 seeds per capsule. But it should beobserved that later in the season the same plants produced under a netplenty of very fine spontaneously self-fertilised capsules.The above two lots of seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted inpairs on opposite sides of five pots. The two lots of seedlings, whenhalf an inch in height, and again when 6 inches high, were measured tothe tips of their leaves, but presented no difference. When fully grown,the flower-stalks were measured to the summits of the seed capsules,with the following result:--TABLE 4/33. Papaver vagum.Heights of flower-stalks to the summits of the seed capsules measured ininches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  24 2/8 :  21.Pot 1  :  30     :  26 5/8.Pot 1  :  18 4/8 :  16.Pot 2  :  14 4/8 :  15 3/8.Pot 2  :  22     :  20 1/8.Pot 2  :  19 5/8 :  14 1/8.Pot 2  :  21 5/8 :  16 4/8.Pot 3  :  20 6/8 :  19 2/8.Pot 3  :  20 2/8 :  13 2/8.Pot 3  :  20 6/8 :  18.Pot 4  :  25 3/8 :  23 2/8.Pot 4  :  24 2/8 :  23.Pot 5  :  20     :  18 3/8.Pot 5  :  27 7/8 :  27.Pot 5  :  19     :  21 2/8.Total  : 328.75  : 293.13.The fifteen crossed plants here average 21.91 inches, and the fifteenself-fertilised plants 19.54 inches in height, or as 100 to 89. Theseplants did not differ in fertility, as far as could be judged by thenumber of capsules produced, for there were seventy-five on the crossedside and seventy-four on the self-fertilised side.Eschscholtzia californica.This plant is remarkable from the crossed seedlings not exceeding inheight or vigour the self-fertilised. On the other hand, a cross greatlyincreases the productiveness of the flowers on the parent-plant, and isindeed sometimes necessary in order that they should produce any seed;moreover, plants thus derived are themselves much more fertile thanthose raised from self-fertilised flowers; so that the whole advantageof a cross is confined to the reproductive system. It will be necessaryfor me to give this singular case in considerable detail.Twelve flowers on some plants in my flower-garden were fertilised withpollen from distinct plants, and produced twelve capsules; but one ofthese contained no good seed. The seeds of the eleven good capsulesweighed 17.4 grains. Eighteen flowers on the same plants were fertilisedwith their own pollen and produced twelve good capsules, which contained13.61 grains weight of seed. Therefore an equal number of crossed andself-fertilised capsules would have yielded seed by weight as 100 to 71.(4/4. Professor Hildebrand experimented on plants in Germany on a largerscale than I did, and found them much more self-fertile. Eighteencapsules, produced by cross-fertilisation, contained on an averageeighty-five seeds, whilst fourteen capsules from self-fertilised flowerscontained on an average only nine seeds; that is, as 100 to 11: 'Jahrb.fur Wissen Botanik.' B. 7 page 467.) If we take into account of the factthat a much greater proportion of flowers produced capsules when crossedthan when self-fertilised, the relative fertility of the crossed to theself-fertilised flowers was as 100 to 52. Nevertheless these plants,whilst still protected by the net, spontaneously produced a considerablenumber of self-fertilised capsules.The seeds of the two lots after germinating on sand were planted inpairs on the opposite sides of four large pots. At first there was nodifference in their growth, but ultimately the crossed seedlingsexceeded the self-fertilised considerably in height, as shown in Table4/34. But I believe from the cases which follow that this result wasaccidental, owing to only a few plants having been measured, and to oneof the self-fertilised plants having grown only to a height of 15inches. The plants had been kept in the greenhouse, and from being drawnup to the light had to be tied to sticks in this and the followingtrials. They were measured to the summits of their flower-stems.TABLE 4/34. Eschscholtzia californica.Heights of Plants to the summits of their flower-stems measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  33 4/8 :  25.Pot 2  :  34 2/8 :  35.Pot 3  :  29     :  27 2/8.Pot 4  :  22     :  15.Total  : 118.75  : 102.25.The four crossed plants here average 29.68 inches, and the fourself-fertilised 25.56 in height; or as 100 to 86. The remaining seedswere sown in a large pot in which a Cineraria had long been growing; andin this case again the two crossed plants on the one side greatlyexceeded in height the two self-fertilised plants on the opposite side.The plants in the above four pots from having been kept in thegreenhouse did not produce on this or any other similar occasion manycapsules; but the flowers on the crossed plants when again crossed weremuch more productive than the flowers on the self-fertilised plants whenagain self-fertilised. These plants after seeding were cut down and keptin the greenhouse; and in the following year, when grown again, theirrelative heights were reversed, as the self-fertilised plants in threeout of the four pots were now taller than and flowered before thecrossed plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.The fact just given with respect to the growth of the cut-down plantsmade me doubtful about my first trial, so I determined to make anotheron a larger scale with crossed and self-fertilised seedlings raised fromthe crossed and self-fertilised plants of the last generation. Elevenpairs were raised and grown in competition in the usual manner; and nowthe result was different, for the two lots were nearly equal duringtheir whole growth. It would therefore be superfluous to give a table oftheir heights. When fully grown and measured, the crossed averaged32.47, and the self-fertilised 32.81 inches in height; or as 100 to 101.There was no great difference in the number of flowers and capsulesproduced by the two lots when both were left freely exposed to thevisits of insects.PLANTS RAISED FROM BRAZILIAN SEED.Fritz Muller sent me from South Brazil seeds of plants which were thereabsolutely sterile when fertilised with pollen from the same plant, butwere perfectly fertile when fertilised with pollen from any other plant.The plants raised by me in England from these seeds were examined byProfessor Asa Gray, and pronounced to belong to E. Californica, withwhich they were identical in general appearance. Two of these plantswere covered by a net, and were found not to be so completelyself-sterile as in Brazil. But I shall recur to this subject in anotherpart of this work. Here it will suffice to state that eight flowers onthese two plants, fertilised with pollen from another plant under thenet, produced eight fine capsules, each containing on an average abouteighty seeds. Eight flowers on these same plants, fertilised with theirown pollen, produced seven capsules, which contained on an average onlytwelve seeds, with a maximum in one of sixteen seeds. Therefore thecross-fertilised capsules, compared with the self-fertilised, yieldedseeds in the ratio of about 100 to 15. These plants of Brazilianparentage differed also in a marked manner from the English plants inproducing extremely few spontaneously self-fertilised capsules under anet.Crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the above plants, aftergerminating on bare sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides offive large pots. The seedlings thus raised were the grandchildren of theplants which grew in Brazil; the parents having been grown in England.As the grandparents in Brazil absolutely require cross-fertilisation inorder to yield any seeds, I expected that self-fertilisation would haveproved very injurious to these seedlings, and that the crossed oneswould have been greatly superior in height and vigour to those raisedfrom self-fertilised flowers. But the result showed that my anticipationwas erroneous; for as in the last experiment with plants of the Englishstock, so in the present one, the self-fertilised plants exceeded thecrossed by a little in height. It will be sufficient to state that thefourteen crossed plants averaged 44.64, and the fourteen self-fertilised45.12 inches in height; or as 100 to 101.THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK.I now tried a different experiment. Eight flowers on the self-fertilisedplants of the last experiment (i.e., grandchildren of the plants whichgrew in Brazil) were again fertilised with pollen from the same plant,and produced five capsules, containing on an average 27.4 seeds, with amaximum in one of forty-two seeds. The seedlings raised from these seedsformed the second SELF-FERTILISED generation of the Brazilian stock.Eight flowers on one of the crossed plants of the last experiment werecrossed with pollen from another grandchild, and produced five capsules.These contained on an average 31.6 seeds, with a maximum in one offorty-nine seeds. The seedlings raised from these seeds may be calledthe INTERCROSSED.Lastly, eight other flowers on the crossed plants of the last experimentwere fertilised with pollen from a plant of the English stock, growingin my garden, and which must have been exposed during many previousgenerations to very different conditions from those to which theBrazilian progenitors of the mother-plant had been subjected. Theseeight flowers produced only four capsules, containing on an average 63.2seeds, with a maximum in one of ninety. The plants raised from theseseeds may be called the ENGLISH-CROSSED. As far as the above averagescan be trusted from so few capsules, the English-crossed capsulescontained twice as many seeds as the intercrossed, and rather more thantwice as many as the self-fertilised capsules. The plants which yieldedthese capsules were grown in pots in the greenhouse, so that theirabsolute productiveness must not be compared with that of plants growingout of doors.The above three lots of seeds, namely, the self-fertilised,intercrossed, and English-crossed, were planted in an equal state ofgermination (having been as usual sown on bare sand) in nine large pots,each divided into three parts by superficial partitions. Many of theself-fertilised seeds germinated before those of the two crossed lots,and these were of course rejected. The seedlings thus raised are thegreat-grandchildren of the plants which grew in Brazil. When they werefrom 2 to 4 inches in height, the three lots were equal. They weremeasured when four-fifths grown, and again when fully grown, and astheir relative heights were almost exactly the same at these two ages, Iwill give only the last measurements. The average height of the nineteenEnglish-crossed plants was 45.92 inches; that of the eighteenintercrossed plants (for one died), 43.38; and that of the nineteenself-fertilised plants, 50.3 inches. So that we have the followingratios in height:--The English-crossed to the self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 109.The English-crossed to the intercrossed plants, as 100 to 94.The intercrossed to the self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 116.After the seed-capsules had been gathered, all these plants were cutdown close to the ground and weighed. The nineteen English crossedplants weighed 18.25 ounces; the intercrossed plants (with their weightcalculated as if there had been nineteen) weighed 18.2 ounces; and thenineteen self-fertilised plants, 21.5 ounces. We have therefore for theweights of the three lots of plants the following ratios:--The English-crossed to the self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 118.The English-crossed to the intercrossed plants, as 100 to 100.The intercrossed to the self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 118.We thus see that in weight, as in height, the self-fertilised plants hada decided advantage over the English-crossed and intercrossed plants.The remaining seeds of the three kinds, whether or not in a state ofgermination, were sown in three long parallel rows in the open ground;and here again the self-fertilised seedlings exceeded in height bybetween 2 and 3 inches the seedlings in the two other rows, which wereof nearly equal heights. The three rows were left unprotected throughoutthe winter, and all the plants were killed, with the exception of two ofthe self-fertilised; so that as far as this little bit of evidence goes,some of the self-fertilised plants were more hardy than any of thecrossed plants of either lot.We thus see that the self-fertilised plants which were grown in the ninepots were superior in height (as 116 to 100), and in weight (as 118 to100), and apparently in hardiness, to the intercrossed plants derivedfrom a cross between the grandchildren of the Brazilian stock. Thesuperiority is here much more strongly marked than in the second trialwith the plants of the English stock, in which the self-fertilised wereto the crossed in height as 101 to 100. It is a far more remarkablefact--if we bear in mind the effects of crossing plants with pollen froma fresh stock in the cases of Ipomoea, Mimulus, Brassica, andIberis--that the self-fertilised plants exceeded in height (as 109 to100), and in weight (as 118 to 100), the offspring of the Brazilianstock crossed by the English stock; the two stocks having been longsubjected to widely different conditions.If we now turn to the fertility of the three lots of plants we find avery different result. I may premise that in five out of the nine potsthe first plant which flowered was one of the English-crossed; in fourof the pots it was a self-fertilised plant; and in not one did anintercrossed plant flower first; so that these latter plants were beatenin this respect, as in so many other ways. The three closely adjoiningrows of plants growing in the open ground flowered profusely, and theflowers were incessantly visited by bees, and certainly thusintercrossed. The manner in which several plants in the previousexperiments continued to be almost sterile as long as they were coveredby a net, but set a multitude of capsules immediately that they wereuncovered, proves how effectually the bees carry pollen from plant toplant. My gardener gathered, at three successive times, an equal numberof ripe capsules from the plants of the three lots, until he hadcollected forty-five from each lot. It is not possible to judge fromexternal appearance whether or not a capsule contains any good seeds; sothat I opened all the capsules. Of the forty-five from theEnglish-crossed plants, four were empty; of those from the intercrossed,five were empty; and of those from the self-fertilised, nine were empty.The seeds were counted in twenty-one capsules taken by chance out ofeach lot, and the average number of seeds in the capsules from theEnglish-crossed plants was 67; from the intercrossed, 56; and from theself-fertilised, 48.52. It therefore follows that:--The forty-five capsules (the four empty ones included) from theEnglish-crossed plants contained 2747 seeds.The forty-five capsules (the five empty ones included) from theintercrossed plants contained 2240 seeds.The forty-five capsules (the nine empty ones included) from theself-fertilised plants contained 1746.7 seeds.The reader should remember that these capsules are the product ofcross-fertilisation, effected by the bees; and that the difference inthe number of the contained seeds must depend on the constitution of theplants;--that is, on whether they were derived from a cross with adistinct stock, or from a cross between plants of the same stock, orfrom self-fertilisation. From the above facts we obtain the followingratios:--Number of seeds contained in an equal number of naturally fertilisedcapsules produced:--By the English-crossed and self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 63.By the English-crossed and intercrossed plants, as 100 to 81.By the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 78.But to have ascertained the productiveness of the three lots of plants,it would have been necessary to know how many capsules were produced bythe same number of plants. The three long rows, however, were not ofquite equal lengths, and the plants were much crowded, so that it wouldhave been extremely difficult to have ascertained how many capsules wereproduced by them, even if I had been willing to undertake so laborious atask as to collect and count all the capsules. But this was feasiblewith the plants grown in pots in the greenhouse; and although these weremuch less fertile than those growing out of doors, their relativefertility appeared, after carefully observing them, to be the same. Thenineteen plants of the English-crossed stock in the pots producedaltogether 240 capsules; the intercrossed plants (calculated asnineteen) produced 137.22 capsules; and the nineteen self-fertilisedplants, 152 capsules. Now, knowing the number of seeds contained inforty-five capsules of each lot, it is easy to calculate the relativenumbers of seeds produced by an equal number of the plants of the threelots.Number of seeds produced by an equal number of naturally-fertilisedplants:--Plants of English-crossed and self-fertilised parentage, as 100 to 40seeds.Plants of English-crossed and intercrossed parentage, as 100 to 45seeds.Plants of intercrossed and self-fertilised parentage, as 100 to 89seeds.The superiority in productiveness of the intercrossed plants (that is,the product of a cross between the grandchildren of the plants whichgrew in Brazil) over the self-fertilised, small as it is, is wholly dueto the larger average number of seeds contained in the capsules; for theintercrossed plants produced fewer capsules in the greenhouse than didthe self-fertilised plants. The great superiority in productiveness ofthe English-crossed over the self-fertilised plants is shown by thelarger number of capsules produced, the larger average number ofcontained seeds, and the smaller number of empty capsules. As theEnglish-crossed and intercrossed plants were the offspring of crosses inevery previous generation (as must have been the case from the flowersbeing sterile with their own pollen), we may conclude that the greatsuperiority in productiveness of the English-crossed over theintercrossed plants is due to the two parents of the former having beenlong subjected to different conditions.The English-crossed plants, though so superior in productiveness, were,as we have seen, decidedly inferior in height and weight to theself-fertilised, and only equal to, or hardly superior to, theintercrossed plants. Therefore, the whole advantage of a cross with adistinct stock is here confined to productiveness, and I have met withno similar case.8. RESEDACEAE.--Reseda lutea.Seeds collected from wild plants growing in this neighbourhood were sownin the kitchen-garden; and several of the seedlings thus raised werecovered with a net. Of these, some were found (as will hereafter be morefully described) to be absolutely sterile when left to fertilisethemselves spontaneously, although plenty of pollen fell on theirstigmas; and they were equally sterile when artificially and repeatedlyfertilised with their own pollen; whilst other plants produced a fewspontaneously self-fertilised capsules. The remaining plants were leftuncovered, and as pollen was carried from plant to plant by the hive andhumble-bees which incessantly visit the flowers, they produced anabundance of capsules. Of the necessity of pollen being carried from oneplant to another, I had ample evidence in the case of this species andof R. odorata; for those plants, which set no seeds or very few as longas they were protected from insects, became loaded with capsulesimmediately that they were uncovered.Seeds from the flowers spontaneously self-fertilised under the net, andfrom flowers naturally crossed by the bees, were sown on opposite sidesof five large pots. The seedlings were thinned as soon as they appearedabove ground, so that an equal number were left on the two sides. Aftera time the pots were plunged into the open ground. The same number ofplants of crossed and self-fertilised parentage were measured up to thesummits of their flower-stems, with the result given in Table 4/35.Those which did not produce flower-stems were not measured.TABLE 4/35.

Of the crossed plants all but five flowered, whilstseveral of the self-fertilised did not do so. The above pairs, whilststill in flower, but with some capsules already formed, were afterwardscut down and weighed. The crossed weighed 90.5 ounces; and an equalnumber of the self-fertilised only 19 ounces, or as 100 to 21; and thisis an astonishing difference.Seeds of the same two lots were also sown in two adjoining rows in theopen ground. There were twenty crossed plants in the one row andthirty-two self-fertilised plants in the other row, so that theexperiment was not quite fair; but not so unfair as it at first appears,for the plants in the same row were not crowded so much as seriously tointerfere with each other's growth, and the ground was bare on theoutside of both rows. These plants were better nourished than those inthe pots and grew to a greater height. The eight tallest plants in eachrow were measured in the same manner as before, with the followingresult:--TABLE 4/36. Reseda lutea, growing in the open ground.Heights of plants to the summits of the flower-stems measured in inches.Column 1: Crossed Plants.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants.         28     :  33 2/8.         27 3/8 :  23.         27 5/8 :  21 5/8.         28 6/8 :  20 4/8.         29 7/8 :  21 5/8.         26 6/8 :  22.         26 2/8 :  21 2/8.         30 1/8 :  21 7/8.Total : 224.75  : 185.13The average height of the crossed plants, whilst in full flower, washere 28.09, and that of the self-fertilised 23.14 inches; or as 100 to82. It is a singular fact that the tallest plant in the two rows, wasone of the self-fertilised. The self-fertilised plants had smaller andpaler green leaves than the crossed. All the plants in the two rows wereafterwards cut down and weighed. The twenty crossed plants weighed 65ounces, and twenty self-fertilised (by calculation from the actualweight of the thirty-two self-fertilised plants) weighed 26.25 ounces;or as 100 to 40. Therefore the crossed plants did not exceed in weightthe self-fertilised plants in nearly so great a degree as those growingin the pots, owing probably to the latter having been subjected to moresevere mutual competition. On the other hand, they exceeded theself-fertilised in height in a slightly greater degree.Reseda odorata.Plants of the common mignonette were raised from purchased seed, andseveral of them were placed under separate nets. Of these some becameloaded with spontaneously self-fertilised capsules; others produced afew, and others not a single one. It must not be supposed that theselatter plants produced no seed because their stigmas did not receive anypollen, for they were repeatedly fertilised with pollen from the sameplant with no effect; but they were perfectly fertile with pollen fromany other plant. Spontaneously self-fertilised seeds were saved from oneof the highly self-fertile plants, and other seeds were collected fromthe plants growing outside the nets, which had been crossed by the bees.These seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on theopposite sides of five pots. The plants were trained up sticks, andmeasured to the summits of their leafy stems--the flower-stems not beingincluded. We here have the result:--TABLE 4/37. Reseda odorata (seedlings from a highly self-fertile plant).Heights of plants to the summits of the leafy stems, flower-stems notincluded, measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  20 7/8 :  22 4/8.Pot 1  :  34 7/8 :  28 5/8.Pot 1  :  26 6/8 :  23 2/8.Pot 1  :  32 6/8 :  30 4/8.Pot 2  :  34 3/8 :  28 5/8.Pot 2  :  34 5/8 :  30 5/8.Pot 2  :  11 6/8 :  23.Pot 2  :  33 3/8 :  30 1/8.Pot 3  :  17 7/8 :   4 4/8.Pot 3  :  27     :  25.Pot 3  :  30 1/8 :  26 3/8.Pot 3  :  30 2/8 :  25 1/8.Pot 4  :  21 5/8 :  22 6/8.Pot 4  :  28     :  25 4/8.Pot 4  :  32 5/8 :  15 1/8.Pot 4  :  32 3/8 :  24 6/8.Pot 5  :  21     :  11 6/8.Pot 5  :  25 2/8 :  19 7/8.Pot 5  :  26 6/8 :  10 4/8.Total  : 522.25  : 428.50.The average height of the nineteen crossed plants is here 27.48, andthat of the nineteen self-fertilised 22.55 inches; or as 100 to 82. Allthese plants were cut down in the early autumn and weighed: the crossedweighed 11.5 ounces, and the self-fertilised 7.75 ounces, or as 100 to67. These two lots having been left freely exposed to the visits ofinsects, did not present any difference to the eye in the number ofseed-capsules which they produced.The remainder of the same two lots of seeds were sown in two adjoiningrows in the open ground; so that the plants were exposed to onlymoderate competition. The eight tallest on each side were measured, asshown in Table 4/38.TABLE 4/38. Reseda odorata, growing in the open ground.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Crossed Plants.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants.         24 4/8 :  26 5/8.         27 2/8 :  25 7/8.         24     :  25.         26 6/8 :  28 3/8.         25     :  29 7/8.         26 2/8 :  25 7/8.         27 2/8 :  26 7/8.         25 1/8 :  28 2/8.Total : 206.13  : 216.75The average height of the eight crossed plants is 25.76, and that of theeight self-fertilised 27.09; or as 100 to 105.We here have the anomalous result of the self-fertilised plants being alittle taller than the crossed; of which fact I can offer noexplanation. It is of course possible, but not probable, that the labelsmay have been interchanged by accident.Another experiment was now tried: all the self-fertilised capsules,though very few in number, were gathered from one of thesemi-self-sterile plants under a net; and as several flowers on thissame plant had been fertilised with pollen from a distinct individual,crossed seeds were thus obtained. I expected that the seedlings fromthis semi-self-sterile plant would have profited in a higher degree froma cross, than did the seedlings from the fully self-fertile plants. Butmy anticipation was quite wrong, for they profited in a less degree. Ananalogous result followed in the case of Eschscholtzia, in which theoffspring of the plants of Brazilian parentage (which were partiallyself-sterile) did not profit more from a cross, than did the plants ofthe far more self-fertile English stock. The above two lots of crossedand self-fertilised seeds from the same plant of Reseda odorata, aftergerminating on sand, were planted on opposite sides of five pots, andmeasured as in the last case, with the result in Table 4/39.TABLE 4/39.

Theseplants were then cut down and weighed; and the crossed in this caseexceeded the self-fertilised in weight by a mere trifle, namely, in theratio of 100 to 99. The two lots, left freely exposed to insects, seemedto be equally fertile.The remainder of the seed was sown in two adjoining rows in the openground; and the eight tallest plants in each row were measured, with theresult in Table 4/40.TABLE 4/40.

VIOLACEAE.--Viola tricolor.Whilst the flowers of the common cultivated heartsease are young, theanthers shed their pollen into a little semi-cylindrical passage, formedby the basal portion of the lower petal, and surrounded by papillae. Thepollen thus collected lies close beneath the stigma, but can seldom gainaccess into its cavity, except by the aid of insects, which pass theirproboscides down this passage into the nectary. (4/5. The flowers ofthis plant have been fully described by Sprengel, Hildebrand, Delpino,and H. Muller. The latter author sums up all the previous observationsin his 'Befruchtung der Blumen' and in 'Nature' November 20, 1873 page44. See also Mr. A.W. Bennett in 'Nature' May 15, 1873 page 50 and someremarks by Mr. Kitchener ibid page 143. The facts which follow on theeffects of covering up a plant of V. tricolor have been quoted by Sir J.Lubbock in his 'British Wild Flowers' etc. page 62.) Consequently when Icovered up a large plant of a cultivated variety, it set only eighteencapsules, and most of these contained very few good seeds--several fromonly one to three; whereas an equally fine uncovered plant of the samevariety, growing close by, produced 105 fine capsules. The few flowerswhich produce capsules when insects are excluded, are perhaps fertilisedby the curling inwards of the petals as their wither, for by this meanspollen-grains adhering to the papillae might be inserted into the cavityof the stigma. But it is more probable that their fertilisation iseffected, as Mr. Bennett suggests, by Thrips and certain minute beetleswhich haunt the flowers, and which cannot be excluded by any net.Humble-bees are the usual fertilisers; but I have more than once seenflies (Rhingia rostrata) at work, with the under sides of their bodies,heads and legs dusted with pollen; and having marked the flowers whichthey visited, I found them after a few days fertilised. (4/6. I shouldadd that this fly apparently did not suck the nectar, but was attractedby the papillae which surround the stigma. Hermann Muller also saw asmall bee, an Andrena, which could not reach the nectar, repeatedlyinserting its proboscis beneath the stigma, where the papillae aresituated; so that these papillae must be in some way attractive toinsects. A writer asserts 'Zoologist' volume 3-4 page 1225, that a moth(Plusia) frequently visits the flowers of the pansy. Hive-bees do notordinarily visit them, but a case has been recorded 'Gardeners'Chronicle' 1844 page 374, of these bees doing so. Hermann Muller hasalso seen the hive-bee at work, but only on the wild small-floweredform. He gives a list 'Nature' 1873 page 45, of all the insects which hehas seen visiting both the large and small-flowered forms. From hisaccount, I suspect that the flowers of plants in a state of nature arevisited more frequently by insects than those of the cultivatedvarieties. He has seen several butterflies sucking the flowers of wildplants, and this I have never observed in gardens, though I have watchedthe flowers during many years.) It is curious for how long a time theflowers of the heartsease and of some other plants may be watchedwithout an insect being seen to visit them. During the summer of 1841, Iobserved many times daily for more than a fortnight some large clumps ofheartsease growing in my garden, before I saw a single humble-bee atwork. During another summer I did the same, but at last saw somedark-coloured humble-bees visiting on three successive days almost everyflower in several clumps; and almost all these flowers quickly witheredand produced fine capsules. I presume that a certain state of theatmosphere is necessary for the secretion of nectar, and that as soon asthis occurs the insects discover the fact by the odour emitted, andimmediately frequent the flowers.As the flowers require the aid of insects for their completefertilisation, and as they are not visited by insects nearly so often asmost other nectar-secreting flowers, we can understand the remarkablefact discovered by H. Muller and described by him in 'Nature,' namely,that this species exists under two forms. One of these bears conspicuousflowers, which, as we have seen, require the aid of insects, and areadapted to be cross-fertilised by them; whilst the other form has muchsmaller and less conspicuously coloured flowers, which are constructedon a slightly different plan, favouring self-fertilisation, and are thusadapted to ensure the propagation of the species. The self-fertile form,however, is occasionally visited, and may be crossed by insects, thoughthis is rather doubtful.In my first experiments on Viola tricolor I was unsuccessful in raisingseedlings, and obtained only one full-grown crossed and self-fertilisedplant. The former was 12 1/2 inches and the latter 8 inches in height.On the following year several flowers on a fresh plant were crossed withpollen from another plant, which was known to be a distinct seedling;and to this point it is important to attend. Several other flowers onthe same plant were fertilised with their own pollen. The average numberof seeds in the ten crossed capsules was 18.7, and in the twelveself-fertilised capsules 12.83; or as 100 to 69. These seeds, aftergerminating on bare sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides offive pots. They were first measured when about a third of their fullsize, and the crossed plants then averaged 3.87 inches, and theself-fertilised only 2.00 inches in height; or as 100 to 52. They werekept in the greenhouse, and did not grow vigorously. Whilst in flowerthey were again measured to the summits of their stems (see Table 4/41),with the following result:--TABLE 4/41. Viola tricolor.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  8 2/8 :  0 2/8.Pot 1  :  7 4/8 :  2 4/8.Pot 1  :  5     :  1 2/8.Pot 2  :  5     :  6.Pot 2  :  4     :  4.Pot 2  :  4 4/8 :  3 1/8.Pot 3  :  9 4/8 :  3 1/8.Pot 3  :  3 3/8 :  1 7/8.Pot 3  :  8 4/8 :  0 5/8.Pot 4  :  4 7/8 :  2 1/8.Pot 4  :  4 2/8 :  1 6/8.Pot 4  :  4     :  2 1/8.Pot 5  :  6     :  3.Pot 5  :  3 3/8 :  1 4/8.Total  : 78.13  : 33.25.The average height of the fourteen crossed plants is here 5.58 inches,and that of the fourteen self-fertilised 2.37; or as 100 to 42. In fourout of the five pots, a crossed plant flowered before any one of theself-fertilised; as likewise occurred with the pair raised during theprevious year. These plants without being disturbed were now turned outof their pots and planted in the open ground, so as to form fiveseparate clumps. Early in the following summer (1869) they floweredprofusely, and being visited by humble-bees set many capsules, whichwere carefully collected from all the plants on both sides. The crossedplants produced 167 capsules, and the self-fertilised only 17; or as 100to 10. So that the crossed plants were more than twice the height of theself-fertilised, generally flowered first, and produced ten times asmany naturally fertilised capsules.By the early part of the summer of 1870 the crossed plants in all thefive clumps had grown and spread so much more than the self-fertilised,that any comparison between them was superfluous. The crossed plantswere covered with a sheet of bloom, whilst only a single self-fertilisedplant, which was much finer than any of its brethren, flowered. Thecrossed and self-fertilised plants had now grown all matted together onthe respective sides of the superficial partitions still separatingthem; and in the clump which included the finest self-fertilised plant,I estimated that the surface covered by the crossed plants was aboutnine times as large as that covered by the self-fertilised plants. Theextraordinary superiority of the crossed over the self-fertilised plantsin all five clumps, was no doubt due to the crossed plants at firsthaving had a decided advantage over the self-fertilised, and thenrobbing them more and more of their food during the succeeding seasons.But we should remember that the same result would follow in a state ofnature even to a greater degree; for my plants grew in ground kept clearof weeds, so that the self-fertilised had to compete only with thecrossed plants; whereas the whole surface of the ground is naturallycovered with various kinds of plants, all of which have to struggletogether for existence.The ensuing winter was very severe, and in the following spring (1871)the plants were again examined. All the self-fertilised were now dead,with the exception of a single branch on one plant, which bore on itssummit a minute rosette of leaves about as large as a pea. On the otherhand, all the crossed plants without exception were growing vigorously.So that the self-fertilised plants, besides their inferiority in otherrespects, were more tender.Another experiment was now tried for the sake of ascertaining how farthe superiority of the crossed plants, or to speak more correctly, theinferiority of the self-fertilised plants, would be transmitted to theiroffspring. The one crossed and one self-fertilised plant, which werefirst raised, had been turned out of their pot and planted in the openground. Both produced an abundance of very fine capsules, from whichfact we may safely conclude that they had been cross-fertilised byinsects. Seeds from both, after germinating on sand, were planted inpairs on the opposite sides of three pots. The naturally crossedseedlings derived from the crossed plants flowered in all three potsbefore the naturally crossed seedlings derived from the self-fertilisedplants. When both lots were in full flower, the two tallest plants oneach side of each pot were measured, and the result is shown in Table4/42.TABLE 4/42. Viola tricolor: seedlings from crossed and self-fertilisedplants, the parents of both sets having been left to be naturallyfertilised.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Naturally Crossed Plants from artificially crossed Plants.Column 3: Naturally Crossed Plants from Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  : 12 1/8 :  9 6/8.Pot 1  : 11 6/8 :  8 3/8.Pot 2  : 13 2/8 :  9 6/8.Pot 2  : 10     : 11 4/8.Pot 3  : 14 4/8 : 11 1/8.Pot 3  : 13 6/8 : 11 3/8.Total  : 75.38  : 61.88.The average height of the six tallest plants derived from the crossedplants is 12.56 inches; and that of the six tallest plants derived fromthe self-fertilised plants is 10.31 inches; or as 100 to 82. We here seea considerable difference in height between the two sets, though veryfar from equalling that in the previous trials between the offspringfrom crossed and self-fertilised flowers. This difference must beattributed to the latter set of plants having inherited a weakconstitution from their parents, the offspring of self-fertilisedflowers; notwithstanding that the parents themselves had been freelyintercrossed with other plants by the aid of insects.10. RANUNCULACEAE.--Adonis aestivalis.The results of my experiments on this plant are hardly worth giving, asI remark in my notes made at the time, "seedlings, from some unknowncause, all miserably unhealthy." Nor did they ever become healthy; yet Ifeel bound to give the present case, as it is opposed to the generalresults at which I have arrived. Fifteen flowers were crossed and allproduced fruit, containing on an average 32.5 seeds; nineteen flowerswere fertilised with their own pollen, and they likewise all yieldedfruit, containing a rather larger average of 34.5 seeds; or as 100 to106. Seedlings were raised from these seeds. In one of the pots all theself-fertilised plants died whilst quite young; in the two others, themeasurements were as follows:TABLE 4/43. Adonis aestivalis.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  : 14     : 13 4/8.Pot 1  : 13 4/8 : 13 4/8.Pot 2  : 16 2/8 : 15 2/8.Pot 2  : 13 2/8 : 15.Total  : 57.00  : 57.25.The average height of the four crossed plants is 14.25, and that of thefour self-fertilised plants 14.31; or as 100 to 100.4; so that they werein fact of equal height. According to Professor H. Hoffman, this plantis proterandrous (4/7. 'Zur Speciesfrage' 1875 page 11.); neverthelessit yields plenty of seeds when protected from insects.Delphinium consolida.It has been said in the case of this plant, as of so many others, thatthe flowers are fertilised in the bud, and that distinct plants orvarieties can never naturally intercross. (4/8. Decaisne'Comptes-Rendus' July 1863 page 5.) But this is an error, as we mayinfer, firstly from the flowers being proterandrous,--the mature stamensbending up, one after the other, into the passage which leads to thenectary, and afterwards the mature pistils bending in the samedirection; secondly, from the number of humble-bees which visit theflowers (4/9. Their structure is described by H. Muller 'Befruchtung'etc., page 122.); and thirdly, from the greater fertility of the flowerswhen crossed with pollen from a distinct plant than when spontaneouslyself-fertilised. In the year 1863 I enclosed a large branch in a net,and crossed five flowers with pollen from a distinct plant; theseyielded capsules containing on an average 35.2 very fine seeds, with amaximum of forty-two in one capsule. Thirty-two other flowers on thesame branch produced twenty-eight spontaneously self-fertilisedcapsules, containing on an average 17.2 seeds, with a maximum in one ofthirty-six seeds. But six of these capsules were very poor, yieldingonly from one to five seeds; if these are excluded, the remainingtwenty-two capsules give an average of 20.9 seeds, though many of theseseeds were small. The fairest ratio, therefore, for the number of seedsproduced by a cross and by spontaneous self-fertilisation is as 100 to59. These seeds were not sown, as I had too many other experiments inprogress.In the summer of 1867, which was a very unfavourable one, I againcrossed several flowers under a net with pollen from a distinct plant,and fertilised other flowers on the same plant with their own pollen.The former yielded a much larger proportion of capsules than the latter;and many of the seeds in the self-fertilised capsules, though numerous,were so poor that an equal number of seeds from the crossed andself-fertilised capsules were in weight as 100 to 45. The two lots wereallowed to germinate on sand, and pairs were planted on the oppositesides of four pots. When nearly two-thirds grown they were measured, asshown in Table 4/44.TABLE 4/44. Delphinium consolida.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  : 11     : 11.Pot 2  : 19     : 16 2/8.Pot 2  : 16 2/8 : 11 4/8.Pot 3  : 26     : 22.Pot 4  :  9 4/8 :  8 2/8.Pot 4  :  8     :  6 4/8.Total  : 89.75  : 75.50.The six crossed plants here average 14.95, and the six self-fertilised12.50 inches in height; or as 100 to 84. When fully grown they wereagain measured, but from want of time only a single plant on each sidewas measured; so that I have thought it best to give the earliermeasurements. At the later period the three tallest crossed plants stillexceeded considerably in height the three tallest self-fertilised, butnot in quite so great a degree as before. The pots were left uncoveredin the greenhouse, but whether the flowers were intercrossed by bees orself-fertilised I do not know. The six crossed plants produced 282mature and immature capsules, whilst the six self-fertilised plantsproduced only 159; or as 100 to 56. So that the crossed plants were verymuch more productive than the self-fertilised.11. CARYOPHYLLACEAE.--Viscaria oculata.Twelve flowers were crossed with pollen from another plant, and yieldedten capsules, containing by weight 5.77 grains of seeds. Eighteenflowers were fertilised with their own pollen and yielded twelvecapsules, containing by weight 2.63 grains. Therefore the seeds from anequal number of crossed and self-fertilised flowers would have been inweight as 100 to 38. I had previously selected a medium-sized capsulefrom each lot, and counted the seeds in both; the crossed one contained284, and the self-fertilised one 126 seeds; or as 100 to 44. These seedswere sown on opposite sides of three pots, and several seedlings raised;but only the tallest flower-stem of one plant on each side was measured.The three on the crossed side averaged 32.5 inches, and the three on theself-fertilised side 34 inches in height; or as 100 to 104. But thistrial was on much too small a scale to be trusted; the plants also grewso unequally that one of the three flower-stems on the crossed plantswas very nearly twice as tall as that on one of the others; and one ofthe three flower-stems on the self-fertilised plants exceeded in anequal degree one of the others.In the following year the experiment was repeated on a larger scale: tenflowers were crossed on a new set of plants and yielded ten capsulescontaining by weight 6.54 grains of seed. Eighteen spontaneouslyself-fertilised capsules were gathered, of which two contained no seed;the other sixteen contained by weight 6.07 grains of seed. Therefore theweight of seed from an equal number of crossed and spontaneouslyself-fertilised flowers (instead of artificially fertilised as in theprevious case) was as 100 to 58.The seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on theopposite sides of four pots, with all the remaining seeds sown crowdedin the opposite sides of a fifth pot; in this latter pot only thetallest plant on each side was measured. Until the seedlings had grownabout 5 inches in height no difference could be perceived in the twolots. Both lots flowered at nearly the same time. When they had almostdone flowering, the tallest flower-stem on each plant was measured, asshown in Table 4/45.TABLE 4/45. Viscaria oculata.Tallest flower-stem on each plant measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  19     :  32 3/8.Pot 1  :  33     :  38.Pot 1  :  41     :  38.Pot 1  :  41     :  28 7/8.Pot 2  :  37 4/8 :  36.Pot 2  :  36 4/8 :  32 3/8.Pot 2  :  38     :  35 6/8.Pot 3  :  44 4/8 :  36.Pot 3  :  39 4/8 :  20 7/8.Pot 3  :  39     :  30 5/8.Pot 4  :  30 2/8 :  36.Pot 4  :  31     :  39.Pot 4  :  33 1/8 :  29.Pot 4  :  24     :  38 4/8.Pot 5  :  30 2/8 :  32.Crowded.Total  : 517.63  : 503.36.The fifteen crossed plants here average 34.5, and the fifteenself-fertilised 33.55 inches in height; or as 100 to 97. So that theexcess of height of the crossed plants is quite insignificant. Inproductiveness, however, the difference was much more plainly marked.All the capsules were gathered from both lots of plants (except from thecrowded and unproductive ones in Pot 5), and at the close of the seasonthe few remaining flowers were added in. The fourteen crossed plantsproduced 381, whilst the fourteen self-fertilised plants produced only293 capsules and flowers; or as 100 to 77.Dianthus caryophyllus.The common carnation is strongly proterandrous, and therefore depends toa large extent upon insects for fertilisation. I have seen onlyhumble-bees visiting the flowers, but I dare say other insects likewisedo so. It is notorious that if pure seed is desired, the greatest careis necessary to prevent the varieties which grow in the same garden fromintercrossing. (4/10. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1847 page 268.) The pollenis generally shed and lost before the two stigmas in the same flowerdiverge and are ready to be fertilised. I was therefore often forced touse for self-fertilisation pollen from the same plant instead of fromthe same flower. But on two occasions, when I attended to this point, Iwas not able to detect any marked difference in the number of seedsproduced by these two forms of self-fertilisation.Several single-flowered carnations were planted in good soil, and wereall covered with a net. Eight flowers were crossed with pollen from adistinct plant and yielded six capsules, containing on an average 88.6seeds, with a maximum in one of 112 seeds. Eight other flowers wereself-fertilised in the manner above described, and yielded sevencapsules containing on an average 82 seeds, with a maximum in one of 112seeds. So that there was very little difference in the number of seedsproduced by cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation, namely, as 100to 92. As these plants were covered by a net, they producedspontaneously only a few capsules containing any seeds, and these fewmay perhaps be attributed to the action of Thrips and other minuteinsects which haunt the flowers. A large majority of the spontaneouslyself-fertilised capsules produced by several plants contained no seeds,or only a single one. Excluding these latter capsules, I counted theseeds in eighteen of the finest ones, and these contained on an average18 seeds. One of the plants was spontaneously self-fertile in a higherdegree than any of the others. On another occasion a single covered-upplant produced spontaneously eighteen capsules, but only two of thesecontained any seed, namely 10 and 15.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FIRST GENERATION.The many seeds obtained from the above crossed and artificiallyself-fertilised flowers were sown out of doors, and two large beds ofseedlings, closely adjoining one another, thus raised. This was thefirst plant on which I experimented, and I had not then formed anyregular scheme of operation. When the two lots were in full flower, Imeasured roughly a large number of plants but record only that thecrossed were on an average fully 4 inches taller than theself-fertilised. Judging from subsequent measurements, we may assumethat the crossed plants were about 28 inches, and the self-fertilisedabout 24 inches in height; and this will give us a ratio of 100 to 86.Out of a large number of plants, four of the crossed ones floweredbefore any one of the self-fertilised plants.Thirty flowers on these crossed plants of the first generation wereagain crossed with pollen from a distinct plant of the same lot, andyielded twenty-nine capsules, containing on an average 55.62 seeds, witha maximum in one of 110 seeds.Thirty flowers on the self-fertilised plants were again self-fertilised;eight of them with pollen from the same flower, and the remainder withpollen from another flower on the same plant; and these producedtwenty-two capsules, containing on an average 35.95 seeds, with amaximum in one of sixty-one seeds. We thus see, judging by the number ofseeds per capsule, that the crossed plants again crossed were moreproductive than the self-fertilised again self-fertilised, in the ratioof 100 to 65. Both the crossed and self-fertilised plants, from havinggrown much crowded in the two beds, produced less fine capsules andfewer seeds than did their parents.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.The crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the crossed andself-fertilised plants of the last generation were sown on oppositesides of two pots; but the seedlings were not thinned enough, so thatboth lots grew very irregularly, and most of the self-fertilised plantsafter a time died from being smothered. My measurements were, therefore,very incomplete. From the first the crossed seedlings appeared thefinest, and when they were on an average, by estimation, 5 inches high,the self-fertilised plants were only 4 inches. In both pots the crossedplants flowered first. The two tallest flower-stems on the crossedplants in the two pots were 17 and 16 1/2 inches in height; and the twotallest flower-stems on the self-fertilised plants 10 1/2 and 9 inches;so that their heights were as 100 to 58. But this ratio, deduced fromonly two pairs, obviously is not in the least trustworthy, and would nothave been given had it not been otherwise supported. I state in my notesthat the crossed plants were very much more luxuriant than theiropponents, and seemed to be twice as bulky. This latter estimate may bebelieved from the ascertained weights of the two lots in the nextgeneration. Some flowers on these crossed plants were again crossed withpollen from another plant of the same lot, and some flowers on theself-fertilised plants again self-fertilised; and from the seeds thusobtained the plants of the next generation were raised.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE THIRD GENERATION.The seeds just alluded to were allowed to germinate on bare sand, andwere planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots. When theseedlings were in full flower, the tallest stem on each plant wasmeasured to the base of the calyx. The measurements are given in Table4/46. In Pot 1 the crossed and self-fertilised plants flowered at thesame time; but in the other three pots the crossed flowered first. Theselatter plants also continued flowering much later in the autumn than theself-fertilised.TABLE 4/46. Dianthus caryophyllus (third generation).Tallest flower-stem on each plant measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  28 6/8 :  30.Pot 1  :  27 3/8 :  26.Pot 2  :  29     :  30 7/8.Pot 2  :  29 4/8 :  27 4/8.Pot 3  :  28 4/8 :  31 6/8.Pot 3  :  23 4/8 :  24 5/8.Pot 4  :  27     :  30.Pot 4  :  33 4/8 :  25.Total  : 227.13  : 225.75.The average height of the eight crossed plants is here 28.39 inches, andof the eight self-fertilised 28.21; or as 100 to 99. So that there wasno difference in height worth speaking of; but in general vigour andluxuriance there was an astonishing difference, as shown by theirweights. After the seed-capsules had been gathered, the eight crossedand the eight self-fertilised plants were cut down and weighed; theformer weighed 43 ounces, and the latter only 21 ounces; or as 100 to49.These plants were all kept under a net, so that the capsules which theyproduced must have been all spontaneously self-fertilised. The eightcrossed plants produced twenty-one such capsules, of which only twelvecontained any seed, averaging 8.5 per capsule. On the other hand, theeight self-fertilised plants produced no less than thirty-six capsules,of which I examined twenty-five, and, with the exception of three, allcontained seeds, averaging 10.63 seeds per capsule. Thus theproportional number of seeds per capsule produced by the plants ofcrossed origin to those produced by the plants of self-fertilised origin(both lots being spontaneously self-fertilised) was as 100 to 125. Thisanomalous result is probably due to some of the self-fertilised plantshaving varied so as to mature their pollen and stigmas more nearly atthe same time than is proper to the species; and we have already seenthat some plants in the first experiment differed from the others inbeing slightly more self-fertile.THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK.Twenty flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the last or thirdgeneration, in Table 4/46, were fertilised with their own pollen, buttaken from other flowers on the same plants. These produced fifteencapsules, which contained (omitting two with only three and six seeds)on an average 47.23 seeds, with a maximum of seventy in one. Theself-fertilised capsules from the self-fertilised plants of the firstgeneration yielded the much lower average of 35.95 seeds; but as theselatter plants grew extremely crowded, nothing can be inferred withrespect to this difference in their self-fertility. The seedlings raisedfrom the above seeds constitute the plants of the fourth self-fertilisedgeneration in Table 4/47.Twelve flowers on the same plants of the third self-fertilisedgeneration, in Table 4/46, were crossed with pollen from the crossedplants in the same table. These crossed plants had been intercrossed forthe three previous generations; and many of them, no doubt, were more orless closely inter-related, but not so closely as in some of theexperiments with other species; for several carnation plants had beenraised and crossed in the earlier generations. They were not related, oronly in a distant degree, to the self-fertilised plants. The parents ofboth the self-fertilised and crossed plants had been subjected to asnearly as possible the same conditions during the three previousgenerations. The above twelve flowers produced ten capsules, containingon an average 48.66 seeds, with a maximum in one of seventy-two seeds.The plants raised from these seeds may be called the INTERCROSSED.Lastly, twelve flowers on the same self-fertilised plants of the thirdgeneration were crossed with pollen from plants which had been raisedfrom seeds purchased in London. It is almost certain that the plantswhich produced these seeds had grown under very different conditions tothose to which my self-fertilised and crossed plants had been subjected;and they were in no degree related. The above twelve flowers thuscrossed all produced capsules, but these contained the low average of37.41 seeds per capsule, with a maximum in one of sixty-four seeds. Itis surprising that this cross with a fresh stock did not give a muchhigher average number of seeds; for, as we shall immediately see, theplants raised from these seeds, which may be called the LONDON-CROSSED,benefited greatly by the cross, both in growth and fertility.The above three lots of seeds were allowed to germinate on bare sand.Many of the London-crossed germinated before the others, and wererejected; and many of the intercrossed later than those of the other twolots. The seeds after thus germinating were planted in ten pots, madetripartite by superficial divisions; but when only two kinds of seedsgerminated at the same time, they were planted on the opposite sides ofother pots; and this is indicated by blank spaces in one of the threecolumns in Table 4/47. A 0 in the table signifies that the seedling diedbefore it was measured; and a + signifies that the plant did not producea flower-stem, and therefore was not measured. It deserves notice thatno less than eight out of the eighteen self-fertilised plants eitherdied or did not flower; whereas only three out of the eighteenintercrossed, and four out of the twenty London-crossed plants, were inthis predicament. The self-fertilised plants had a decidedly lessvigorous appearance than the plants of the other two lots, their leavesbeing smaller and narrower. In only one pot did a self-fertilised plantflower before one of the two kinds of crossed plants, between whichthere was no marked difference in the period of flowering. The plantswere measured to the base of the calyx, after they had completed theirgrowth, late in the autumn.TABLE 4/47.

As thecapsules of each lot became ripe they were gathered and kept separate,the empty or bad ones being thrown away. But towards the middle ofOctober, when the capsules could no longer ripen, all were gathered andwere counted, whether good or bad. The capsules were then crushed, andthe seed cleaned by sieves and weighed. For the sake of uniformity theresults are given from calculation, as if there had been twenty plantsin each lot.The sixteen London-crossed plants actually produced 286 capsules;therefore twenty such plants would have produced 357.5 capsules; andfrom the actual weight of the seeds, the twenty plants would haveyielded 462 grains weight of seeds.The fifteen intercrossed plants actually produced 157 capsules;therefore twenty of them would have produced 209.3 capsules and theseeds would have weighed 208.48 grains.The ten self-fertilised plants actually produced 70 capsules, thereforetwenty of them would have produced 140 capsules; and the seeds wouldhave weighed 153.2 grains.From these data we get the following ratios:--NUMBER OF CAPSULES PRODUCED BY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PLANTS OF THE THREELOTS.NUMBER OF CAPSULES:The London-crossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 39.The London-crossed to the intercrossed as 100 to 45.The intercrossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 67.WEIGHT OF SEEDS PRODUCED BY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PLANTS OF THE THREE LOTS.WEIGHT OF SEED:The London-crossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 33.The London-crossed to the intercrossed as 100 to 45.The intercrossed to the self-fertilised as 100 to 73.We thus see how greatly the offspring from the self-fertilised plants ofthe third generation crossed by a fresh stock, had their fertilityincreased, whether tested by the number of capsules produced or by theweight of the contained seeds; this latter being the more trustworthymethod. Even the offspring from the self-fertilised plants crossed byone of the crossed plants of the same stock, notwithstanding that bothlots had been long subjected to the same conditions, had their fertilityconsiderably increased, as tested by the same two methods.In conclusion it may be well to repeat in reference to the fertility ofthese three lots of plants, that their flowers were left freely exposedto the visits of insects and were undoubtedly crossed by them, as may beinferred from the large number of good capsules produced. These plantswere all the offspring of the same mother-plants, and the stronglymarked difference in their fertility must be attributed to the nature ofthe pollen employed in fertilising their parents; and the difference inthe nature of the pollen must be attributed to the different treatmentto which the pollen-bearing parents had been subjected during severalprevious generations.COLOUR OF THE FLOWERS.The flowers produced by the self-fertilised plants of the last or fourthgeneration were as uniform in tint as those of a wild species, being ofa pale pink or rose colour. Analogous cases with Mimulus and Ipomoea,after several generations of self-fertilisation, have been alreadygiven. The flowers of the intercrossed plants of the fourth generationwere likewise nearly uniform in colour. On the other hand, the flowersof the London-crossed plants, or those raised from a cross with thefresh stock which bore dark crimson flowers, varied extremely in colour,as might have been expected, and as is the general rule with seedlingcarnations. It deserves notice that only two or three of theLondon-crossed plants produced dark crimson flowers like those of theirfathers, and only a very few of a pale pink like those of their mothers.The great majority had their petals longitudinally and variously stripedwith the two colours,--the groundwork tint being, however, in some casesdarker than that of the mother-plants.12. MALVACEAE.--Hibiscus africanus.Many flowers on this Hibiscus were crossed with pollen from a distinctplant, and many others were self-fertilised. A rather largerproportional number of the crossed than of the self-fertilised flowersyielded capsules, and the crossed capsules contained rather more seeds.The self-fertilised seeds were a little heavier than an equal number ofthe crossed seeds, but they germinated badly, and I raised only fourplants of each lot. In three out of the four pots, the crossed plantsflowered first.TABLE 4/48.

Here we have the unusual caseof self-fertilised plants exceeding the crossed in height; but only fourpairs were measured, and these did not grow well or equally. I did notcompare the fertility of the two lots.CHAPTER V.GERANIACEAE, LEGUMINOSAE, ONAGRACEAE, ETC.Pelargonium zonale, a cross between plants propagated by cuttings doesno good.Tropaeolum minus.Limnanthes douglasii.Lupinus luteus and pilosus.Phaseolus multiflorus and vulgaris.Lathyrus odoratus, varieties of, never naturally intercross in England.Pisum sativum, varieties of, rarely intercross, but a cross between themhighly beneficial.Sarothamnus scoparius, wonderful effects of a cross.Ononis minutissima, cleistogene flowers of.Summary on the Leguminosae.Clarkia elegans.Bartonia aurea.Passiflora gracilis.Apium petroselinum.Scabiosa atropurpurea.Lactuca sativa.Specularia speculum.Lobelia ramosa, advantages of a cross during two generations.Lobelia fulgens.Nemophila insignis, great advantages of a cross.Borago officinalis.Nolana prostrata.13. GERANIACEAE.--Pelargonium zonale.This plant, as a general rule, is strongly proterandrous, and istherefore adapted for cross-fertilisation by the aid of insects. (5/1.Mr. J. Denny, a great raiser of new varieties of pelargoniums, afterstating that this species is proterandrous, adds 'The Florist andPomologist' January 1872 page 11, "there are some varieties, especiallythose with petals of a pink colour, or which possess a weaklyconstitution, where the pistil expands as soon as or even before thepollen-bag bursts, and in which also the pistil is frequently short, sowhen it expands it is smothered as it were by the bursting anthers;these varieties are great seeders, each pip being fertilised by its ownpollen. I would instance Christine as an example of this fact." We havehere an interesting case of variability in an important functionalpoint.) Some flowers on a common scarlet variety were self-fertilised,and other flowers were crossed with pollen from another plant; but nosooner had I done so, than I remembered that these plants had beenpropagated by cuttings from the same stock, and were therefore parts ina strict sense of the same individual. Nevertheless, having made thecross I resolved to save the seeds, which, after germinating on sand,were planted on the opposite sides of three pots. In one pot thequasi-crossed plant was very soon and ever afterwards taller and finerthan the self-fertilised. In the two other pots the seedlings on bothsides were for a time exactly equal; but when the self-fertilised plantswere about 10 inches in height, they surpassed their antagonists by alittle, and ever afterwards showed a more decided and increasingadvantage; so that the self-fertilised plants, taken altogether, weresomewhat superior to the quasi-crossed plants. In this case, as in thatof the Origanum, if individuals which have been asexually propagatedfrom the same stock, and which have been long subjected to the sameconditions, are crossed, no advantage whatever is gained.Several flowers on another plant of the same variety were fertilisedwith pollen from the younger flowers on the same plant, so as to avoidusing the old and long-shed pollen from the same flower, as I thoughtthat this latter might be less efficient than fresh pollen. Otherflowers on the same plant were crossed with fresh pollen from a plantwhich, although closely similar, was known to have arisen as a distinctseedling. The self-fertilised seeds germinated rather before the others;but as soon as I got equal pairs they were planted on the opposite sidesof four pots.TABLE 5/49. Pelargonium zonale.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  22 3/8 :  25 5/8.Pot 1  :  19 6/8 :  12 4/8.Pot 2  :  15     :  19 6/8.Pot 2  :  12 2/8 :  22 3/8.Pot 3  :  30 5/8 :  19 4/8.Pot 3  :  18 4/8 :   7 4/8.Pot 4  :  38     :   9 1/8.Total  : 156.50  : 116.38.When the two lots of seedlings were between 4 and 5 inches in heightthey were equal, excepting in Pot 4, in which the crossed plant was muchthe tallest. When between 11 and 14 inches in height, they were measuredto the tips of their uppermost leaves; the crossed averaged 13.46, andthe self-fertilised 11.07 inches in height, or as 100 to 82. Five monthslater they were again measured in the same manner, and the results aregiven in Table 5/49.The seven crossed plants now averaged 22.35, and the sevenself-fertilised 16.62 inches in height, or as 100 to 74. But from thegreat inequality of the several plants, the result is less trustworthythan in most other cases. In Pot 2 the two self-fertilised plants alwayshad an advantage, except whilst quite young over the two crossed plants.As I wished to ascertain how these plants would behave during a secondgrowth, they were cut down close to the ground whilst growing freely.The crossed plants now showed their superiority in another way, for onlyone out of the seven was killed by the operation, whilst three of theself-fertilised plants never recovered. There was, therefore, no use inkeeping any of the plants excepting those in Pots 1 and 3; and in thefollowing year the crossed plants in these two pots showed during theirsecond growth nearly the same relative superiority over theself-fertilised plants as before.Tropaeolum minus.The flowers are proterandrous, and are manifestly adapted forcross-fertilisation by insects, as shown by Sprengel and Delpino. Twelveflowers on some plants growing out of doors were crossed with pollenfrom a distinct plant and produced eleven capsules, containingaltogether twenty-four good seeds. Eighteen flowers were fertilised withtheir own pollen and produced only eleven capsules, containingtwenty-two good seeds; so that a much larger proportion of the crossedthan of the self-fertilised flowers produced capsules, and the crossedcapsules contained rather more seed than the self-fertilised in theratio of 100 to 92. The seeds from the self-fertilised capsules werehowever the heavier of the two, in the ratio of 100 to 87.Seeds in an equal state of germination were planted on the oppositesides of four pots, but only the two tallest plants on each side of eachpot were measured to the tops of their stems. The pots were placed inthe greenhouse, and the plants trained up sticks, so that they ascendedto an unusual height. In three of the pots the crossed plants floweredfirst, but in the fourth at the same time with the self-fertilised. Whenthe seedlings were between 6 and 7 inches in height, the crossed beganto show a slight advantage over their opponents. When grown to aconsiderable height the eight tallest crossed plants averaged 44.43, andthe eight tallest self-fertilised plants 37.34 inches, or as 100 to 84.When their growth was completed they were again measured, as shown inTable 5/50.TABLE 5/50. Tropaeolum minus.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  65     :  31.Pot 1  :  50     :  45.Pot 2  :  69     :  42.Pot 2  :  35     :  45.Pot 3  :  70     :  50 4/8.Pot 3  :  59 4/8 :  55 4/8.Pot 4  :  61 4/8 :  37 4/8.Pot 4  :  57 4/8 :  61 4/8.Total  : 467.5   : 368.0.The eight tallest crossed plants now averaged 58.43, and the eighttallest self-fertilised plants 46 inches in height, or as 100 to 79.There was also a great difference in the fertility of the two lots whichwere left uncovered in the greenhouse. On the 17th of September thecapsules from all the plants were gathered, and the seeds counted. Thecrossed plants yielded 243, whilst the same number of self-fertilisedplants yielded only 155 seeds, or as 100 to 64.Limnanthes douglasii.Several flowers were crossed and self-fertilised in the usual manner,but there was no marked difference in the number of seeds which theyyielded. A vast number of spontaneously self-fertilised capsules werealso produced under the net. Seedlings were raised in five pots from theabove seeds, and when the crossed were about 3 inches in height theyshowed a slight advantage over the self-fertilised. When double thisheight, the sixteen crossed and sixteen self-fertilised plants weremeasured to the tips of their leaves; the former averaged 7.3 inches,and the self-fertilised 6.07 inches in height, or as 100 to 83. In allthe pots, excepting 4, a crossed plant flowered before any one of theself-fertilised plants. The plants, when fully grown, were againmeasured to the summits of their ripe capsules, with the result in Table5/51.TABLE 5/51.

Mr. Galton considers that a higher ratio would be fairer, namely,100 to 76. He made a graphical representation of the above measurements,and adds the words "very good" to the curvature thus formed. Both lotsof plants produced an abundance of seed-capsules, and, as far as couldbe judged by the eye, there was no difference in their fertility.]14. LEGUMINOSAE.In this family I experimented on the following six genera, Lupinus,Phaseolus, Lathyrus, Pisum, Sarothamnus, and Ononis.[Lupinus luteus. (5/2. The structure of the flowers of this plant, andtheir manner of fertilisation, have been described by H. Muller'Befruchtung' etc. page 243. The flowers do not secrete free nectar, andbees generally visit them for their pollen. Mr. Farrer, however, remarks'Nature' 1872 page 499, that "there is a cavity at the back and base ofthe vexillum, in which I have not been able to find nectar. But thebees, which constantly visit these flowers, certainly go to this cavityfor what they want, and not to the staminal tube.")A few flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant, but owingto the unfavourable season only two crossed seeds were produced. Nineseeds were saved from flowers spontaneously self-fertilised under a net,on the same plant which yielded the two crossed seeds. One of thesecrossed seeds was sown in a pot with two self-fertilised seeds on theopposite side; the latter came up between two and three days before thecrossed seed. The second crossed seed was sown in like manner with twoself-fertilised seeds on the opposite side; these latter also came upabout a day before the crossed one. In both pots, therefore, the crossedseedlings from germinating later, were at first completely beaten by theself-fertilised; nevertheless, this state of things was afterwardscompletely reversed. The seeds were sown late in the autumn, and thepots, which were much too small, were kept in the greenhouse. The plantsin consequence grew badly, and the self-fertilised suffered most in bothpots. The two crossed plants when in flower during the following springwere 9 inches in height; one of the self-fertilised plants was 8, andthe three others only 3 inches in height, being thus mere dwarfs. Thetwo crossed plants produced thirteen pods, whilst the fourself-fertilised plants produced only a single one. Some otherself-fertilised plants which had been raised separately in larger potsproduced several spontaneously self-fertilised pods under a net, andseeds from these were used in the following experiment.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.The spontaneously self-fertilised seeds just mentioned, and crossedseeds obtained by intercrossing the two crossed plants of the lastgeneration, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs on theopposite sides of three large pots. When the seedlings were only 4inches in height, the crossed had a slight advantage over theiropponents. When grown to their full height, every one of the crossedplants exceeded its opponent in height. Nevertheless the self-fertilisedplants in all three pots flowered before the crossed! The measurementsare given in Table 5/52.TABLE 5/52. Lupinus luteus.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  33 2/8 :  24 4/8.Pot 1  :  30 4/8 :  18 4/8.Pot 1  :  30     :  28.Pot 2  :  29 4/8 :  26.Pot 2  :  30     :  25.Pot 3  :  30 4/8 :  28.Pot 3  :  31     :  27 2/8.Pot 3  :  31 4/8 :  24 4/8.Total  : 246.25  : 201.75.The eight crossed plants here average 30.78, and the eightself-fertilised 25.21 inches in height; or as 100 to 82. These plantswere left uncovered in the greenhouse to set their pods, but theyproduced very few good ones, perhaps in part owing to few bees visitingthem. The crossed plants produced nine pods, containing on an average3.4 seeds, and the self-fertilised plants seven pods, containing on anaverage 3 seeds, so that the seeds from an equal number of plants wereas 100 to 88.Two other crossed seedlings, each with two self-fertilised seedlings onthe opposite sides of the same large pot, were turned out of their potsearly in the season, without being disturbed, into open ground of goodquality. They were thus subjected to but little competition with oneanother, in comparison with the plants in the above three pots. In theautumn the two crossed plants were about 3 inches taller than the fourself-fertilised plants; they looked also more vigorous and produced manymore pods.Two other crossed and self-fertilised seeds of the same lot, aftergerminating on sand, were planted on the opposite sides of a large pot,in which a Calceolaria had long been growing, and were therefore exposedto unfavourable conditions: the two crossed plants ultimately attained aheight of 20 1/2 and 20 inches, whilst the two self-fertilised were only18 and 9 1/2 inches high.Lupinus pilosus.From a series of accidents I was again unfortunate in obtaining asufficient number of crossed seedlings; and the following results wouldnot be worth giving, did they not strictly accord with those just givenwith respect to Lupinus luteus. I raised at first only a single crossedseedling, which was placed in competition with two self-fertilised oneson the opposite side of the same pot. These plants, without beingdisturbed, were soon afterwards turned into the open ground. By theautumn the crossed plant had grown to so large a size that it almostsmothered the two self-fertilised plants, which were mere dwarfs; andthe latter died without maturing a single pod. Several self-fertilisedseeds had been planted at the same time separately in the open ground;and the two tallest of these were 33 and 32 inches, whereas the onecrossed plant was 38 inches in height. This latter plant also producedmany more pods than did any one of the self-fertilised plants, althoughgrowing separately. A few flowers on the one crossed plant were crossedwith pollen from one of the self-fertilised plants, for I had no othercrossed plant from which to obtain pollen. One of the self-fertilisedplants having been covered by a net produced plenty of spontaneouslyself-fertilised pods.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.From crossed and self-fertilised seeds obtained in the manner justdescribed, I succeeded in raising to maturity only a pair of plants,which were kept in a pot in the greenhouse. The crossed plant grew to aheight of 33 inches, and the self-fertilised to that of 26 1/2 inches.The former produced, whilst still kept in the greenhouse, eight pods,containing on an average 2.77 seeds; and the latter only two pods,containing on an average 2.5 seeds. The average height of the twocrossed plants of the two generations taken together was 35.5, and thatof the three self-fertilised plants of the same two generations 30.5; oras 100 to 86. (5/3. We here see that both Lupinus luteus and pilosusseed freely when insects are excluded; but Mr. Swale, of Christchurch,in New Zealand, informs me 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1858 page 828, thatthe garden varieties of the lupine are not there visited by any bees,and that they seed less freely than any other introduced leguminousplant, with the exception of red clover. He adds "I have, for amusement,during the summer, released the stamens with a pin, and a pod of seedhas always rewarded me for my trouble, the adjoining flowers not soserved having all proved blind." I do not know to what species thisstatement refers.)Phaseolus multiflorus.This plant, the scarlet-runner of English gardeners and the Phaseoluscoccineus of Lamarck, originally came from Mexico, as I am informed byMr. Bentham. The flowers are so constructed that hive and humble-bees,which visit them incessantly, almost always alight on the leftwing-petal, as they can best suck the nectar from this side. Theirweight and movements depress the petal, and this causes the stigma toprotrude from the spirally-wound keel, and a brush of hairs round thestigma pushes out the pollen before it. The pollen adheres to the heador proboscis of the bee which is at work, and is thus placed either onthe stigma of the same flower, or is carried to another flower. (5/4.The flowers have been described by Delpino, and in an admirable mannerby Mr. Farrer in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 24th series October 1868 page 256. My son Francis has explained 'Nature'January 8, 1874 page 189, the use of one peculiarity in their structure,namely, a little vertical projection on the single free stamen near itsbase, which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the twonectar-holes in the staminal sheath. He shows that this projectionprevents the bees reaching the nectar, unless they go to the left sideof the flower, and it is absolutely necessary for cross-fertilisationthat they should alight on the left wing-petal.) Several years ago Icovered some plants under a large net, and these produced on oneoccasion about one-third, and on another occasion about one-eighth, ofthe number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growingclose alongside produced. (5/5. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 andmore especially ibid 1858 page 828. Also 'Annals and Magazine of NaturalHistory' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.) This lessened fertility wasnot caused by any injury from the net, as I moved the wing-petals ofseveral protected flowers, in the same manner as bees do, and theseproduced remarkably fine pods. When the net was taken off, the flowerswere immediately visited by bees, and it was interesting to observe howquickly the plants became covered with young pods. As the flowers aremuch frequented by Thrips, the self-fertilisation of most of the flowersunder the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects.Dr. Ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant, and "out of avast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod,while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful." Mr.Belt gives a more curious case; this plant grows well and flowers inNicaragua; but as none of the native bees visit the flowers, not asingle pod is ever produced. (5/6. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review'1870 page 168. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 70. Thelatter author gives a case 'Nature' 1875 page 26, of a late crop ofPhaseolus multiflorus near London which "was rendered barren" by thehumble-bees cutting, as they frequently do, holes at the bases of theflowers instead of entering them in the proper manner.)From the facts now given we may feel nearly sure that individuals of thesame variety or of different varieties, if growing near each other andin flower at the same time, would intercross; but I cannot myselfadvance any direct evidence of such an occurrence, as only a singlevariety is commonly cultivated in England. I have, however, received anaccount from the Reverend W.A. Leighton, that plants raised by him fromordinary seed produced seeds differing in an extraordinary manner incolour and shape, leading to the belief that their parents must havebeen crossed. In France M. Fermond more than once planted close togethervarieties which ordinarily come true and which bear differently colouredflowers and seeds; and the offspring thus raised varied so greatly thatthere could hardly be a doubt that they had intercrossed. (5/7.'F�condation chez les V�g�taux' 1859 pages 34-40. He adds that M.Villiers has described a spontaneous hybrid, which he calls Phaseoluscoccineus hybridus, in the 'Annales de la Soc. R. de Horticulture' June1844.) On the other hand, Professor H. Hoffman does not believe in thenatural crossing of the varieties; for although seedlings raised fromtwo varieties growing close together produced plants which yielded seedsof a mixed character, he found that this likewise occurred with plantsseparated by a space of from 40 to 150 paces from any other variety; hetherefore attributes the mixed character of the seed to spontaneousvariability. (5/8. 'Bestimmung des Werthes von Species und Varietat'1869 pages 47-72.) But the above distance would be very far fromsufficient to prevent intercrossing: cabbages have been known to crossat several times this distance; and the careful Gartner gives manyinstances of plants growing at from 600 to 800 yards apart fertilisingone another. (5/9. 'Kenntnis der Befruchtung' 1844 pages 573, 577.)Professor Hoffman even maintains that the flowers of the kidney-bean arespecially adapted for self-fertilisation. He enclosed several flowers inbags; and as the buds often dropped off, he attributes the partialsterility of these flowers to the injurious effects of the bags, and notto the exclusion of insects. But the only safe method of experimentingis to cover up a whole plant, which then never suffers.Self-fertilised seeds were obtained by moving up and down in the samemanner as bees do the wing-petals of flowers protected by a net; andcrossed seeds were obtained by crossing two of the plants under the samenet. The seeds after germinating on sand were planted on the oppositesides of two large pots, and equal-sized sticks were given them to twineup. When 8 inches in height, the plants on the two sides were equal. Thecrossed plants flowered before the self-fertilised in both pots. As soonas one of each pair had grown to the summit of its stick both weremeasured.TABLE 5/53. Phaseolus multiflorus.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  87     :  84 6/8.Pot 1  :  88     :  87.Pot 1  :  82 4/8 :  76.Pot 2  :  90     :  76 4/8.Pot 2  :  82 4/8 :  87 4/8.Total  : 430.00  : 411.75.The average height of the five crossed plants is 86 inches, and that ofthe five self-fertilised plants 82.35; or as 100 to 96. The pots werekept in the greenhouse, and there was little or no difference in thefertility of the two lots. Therefore as far as these few observationsserve, the advantage gained by a cross is very small.Phaseolus vulgaris.With respect to this species, I merely ascertained that the flowers werehighly fertile when insects were excluded, as indeed must be the case,for the plants are often forced during the winter when no insects arepresent. Some plants of two varieties (namely Canterbury and Fulmer'sForcing Bean) were covered with a net, and they seemed to produce asmany pods, containing as many beans, as some uncovered plants growingalongside; but neither the pods nor the beans were actually counted.This difference in self-fertility between Phaseolus vulgaris andmultifloris is remarkable, as these two species are so closely relatedthat Linnaeus thought that they formed one. When the varieties ofPhaseolus vulgaris grow near one another in the open ground, theysometimes cross largely, notwithstanding their capacity forself-fertilisation. Mr. Coe has given me a remarkable instance of thisfact with respect to the negro and a white-seeded and a brown-seededvariety, which were all grown together. The diversity of character inthe seedlings of the second generation raised by me from his plants waswonderful. I could add other analogous cases, and the fact is well-knownto gardeners. (5/10. I have given Mr. Coe's case in the 'Gardeners'Chronicle' 1858 page 829. See also for another case ibid page 845.)Lathyrus odoratus.Almost everyone who has studied the structure of papilionaceous flowershas been convinced that they are specially adapted forcross-fertilisation, although many of the species are likewise capableof self-fertilisation. The case therefore of Lathyrus odoratus or thesweet-pea is curious, for in this country it seems invariably tofertilise itself. I conclude that this is so, as five varieties,differing greatly in the colour of their flowers but in no otherrespect, are commonly sold and come true; yet on inquiry from two greatraisers of seed for sale, I find that they take no precautions to insurepurity--the five varieties being habitually grown close together. (5/11.See Mr. W. Earley in 'Nature' 1872 page 242, to the same effect. Heonce, however, saw bees visiting the flowers, and supposed that on thisoccasion they would have been intercrossed.) I have myself purposelymade similar trials with the same result. Although the varieties alwayscome true, yet, as we shall presently see, one of the five well-knownvarieties occasionally gives birth to another, which exhibits all itsusual characters. Owing to this curious fact, and to the darker-colouredvarieties being the most productive, these increase, to the exclusion ofthe others, as I was informed by the late Mr. Masters, if there be noselection.In order to ascertain what would be the effect of crossing twovarieties, some flowers on the Purple sweet-pea, which has a darkreddish-purple standard-petal with violet-coloured wing-petals and keel,were castrated whilst very young, and were fertilised with pollen of thePainted Lady. This latter variety has a pale cherry-coloured standard,with almost white wings and keel. On two occasions I raised from aflower thus crossed plants perfectly resembling both parent-forms; butthe greater number resembled the paternal variety. So perfect was theresemblance, that I should have suspected some mistake in the label, hadnot the plants, which were at first identical in appearance with thefather or Painted Lady, later in the season produced flowers blotchedand streaked with dark purple. This is an interesting example of partialreversion in the same individual plant as it grows older. Thepurple-flowered plants were thrown away, as they might possibly havebeen the product of the accidental self-fertilisation of themother-plant, owing to the castration not having been effectual. But theplants which resembled in the colour of their flowers the paternalvariety or Painted Lady were preserved, and their seeds saved. Nextsummer many plants were raised from these seeds, and they generallyresembled their grandfather the Painted Lady, but most of them had theirwing-petals streaked and stained with dark pink; and a few had palepurple wings with the standard of a darker crimson than is natural tothe Painted Lady, so that they formed a new sub-variety. Amongst theseplants a single one appeared having purple flowers like those of thegrandmother, but with the petals slightly streaked with a paler tint:this was thrown away. Seeds were again saved from the foregoing plants,and the seedlings thus raised still resembled the Painted Lady, orgreat-grandfather; but they now varied much, the standard petal varyingfrom pale to dark red, in a few instances with blotches of white; andthe wing-petals varied from nearly white to purple, the keel being inall nearly white.As no variability of this kind can be detected in plants raised fromseeds, the parents of which have grown during many successivegenerations in close proximity, we may infer that they cannot haveintercrossed. What does occasionally occur is that in a row of plantsraised from seeds of one variety, another variety true of its kindappears; for instance, in a long row of Scarlets (the seeds of which hadbeen carefully gathered from Scarlets for the sake of this experiment)two Purples and one Painted Lady appeared. Seeds from these threeaberrant plants were saved and sown in separate beds. The seedlings fromboth the Purples were chiefly Purples, but with some Painted Ladies andsome Scarlets. The seedlings from the aberrant Painted Lady were chieflyPainted Ladies with some Scarlets. Each variety, whatever its parentagemay have been, retained all its characters perfect, and there was nostreaking or blotching of the colours, as in the foregoing plants ofcrossed origin. Another variety, however, is often sold, which isstriped and blotched with dark purple; and this is probably of crossedorigin, for I found, as well as Mr. Masters, that it did not transmitits characters at all truly.From the evidence now given, we may conclude that the varieties of thesweet-pea rarely or never intercross in this country; and this is ahighly remarkable fact, considering, firstly, the general structure ofthe flowers; secondly, the large quantity of pollen produced, far morethan is requisite for self-fertilisation; and thirdly, the occasionalvisit of insects. That insects should sometimes fail to cross-fertilisethe flowers is intelligible, for I have thrice seen humble-bees of twokinds, as well as hive-bees, sucking the nectar, and they did notdepress the keel-petals so as to expose the anthers and stigma; theywere therefore quite inefficient for fertilising the flowers. One ofthese bees, namely, Bombus lapidarius, stood on one side at the base ofthe standard and inserted its proboscis beneath the single separatestamen, as I afterwards ascertained by opening the flower and findingthis stamen prised up. Bees are forced to act in this manner from theslit in the staminal tube being closely covered by the broad membranousmargin of the single stamen, and from the tube not being perforated bynectar-passages. On the other hand, in the three British species ofLathyrus which I have examined, and in the allied genus Vicia, twonectar-passages are present. Therefore British bees might well bepuzzled how to act in the case of the sweet-pea. I may add that thestaminal tube of another exotic species, Lathyrus grandiflorus, is notperforated by nectar-passages, and this species has rarely set any podsin my garden, unless the wing-petals were moved up and down, in the samemanner as bees ought to do; and then pods were generally formed, butfrom some cause often dropped off afterwards. One of my sons caught anelephant sphinx-moth whilst visiting the flowers of the sweet-pea, butthis insect would not depress the wing-petals and keel. On the otherhand, I have seen on one occasion hive-bees, and two or three occasionsthe Megachile willughbiella in the act of depressing the keel; and thesebees had the under sides of their bodies thickly covered with pollen,and could not thus fail to carry pollen from one flower to the stigma ofanother. Why then do not the varieties occasionally intercross, thoughthis would not often happen, as insects so rarely act in an efficientmanner? The fact cannot, as it appears, be explained by the flowersbeing self-fertilised at a very early age; for although nectar issometimes secreted and pollen adheres to the viscid stigma before theflowers are fully expanded, yet in five young flowers which wereexamined by me the pollen-tubes were not exserted. Whatever the causemay be, we may conclude, that in England the varieties never or veryrarely intercross. But it does not follow from this, that they would notbe cross by the aid of other and larger insects in their native country,which in botanical works is said to be the south of Europe and the EastIndies. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Delpino, in Florence, and heinforms me "that it is the fixed opinion of gardeners there that thevarieties do intercross, and that they cannot be preserved pure unlessthey are sown separately."It follows also from the foregoing facts that the several varieties ofthe sweet-pea must have propagated themselves in England byself-fertilisation for very many generations, since the time when eachnew variety first appeared. From the analogy of the plants of Mimulusand Ipomoea, which had been self-fertilised for several generations, andfrom trials previously made with the common pea, which is in nearly thesame state as the sweet-pea, it appeared to me very improbable that across between the individuals of the same variety would benefit theoffspring. A cross of this kind was therefore not tried, which I nowregret. But some flowers of the Painted Lady, castrated at an early age,were fertilised with pollen from the Purple sweet-pea; and it should beremembered that these varieties differ in nothing except in the colourof their flowers. The cross was manifestly effectual (though only twoseeds were obtained), as was shown by the two seedlings, when theyflowered, closely resembling their father, the Purple pea, exceptingthat they were a little lighter coloured, with their keels slightlystreaked with pale purple. Seeds from flowers spontaneouslyself-fertilised under a net were at the same time saved from the samemother-plant, the Painted Lady. These seeds unfortunately did notgerminate on sand at the same time with the crossed seeds, so that theycould not be planted simultaneously. One of the two crossed seeds in astate of germination was planted in a pot (Number 1) in which aself-fertilised seed in the same state had been planted four daysbefore, so that this latter seedling had a great advantage over thecrossed one. In Pot 2 the other crossed seed was planted two days beforea self-fertilised one; so that here the crossed seedling had aconsiderable advantage over the self-fertilised one. But this crossedseedling had its summit gnawed off by a slug, and was in consequence fora time quite beaten by the self-fertilised plant. Nevertheless I allowedit to remain, and so great was its constitutional vigour that itultimately beat its uninjured self-fertilised rival. When all fourplants were almost fully grown they were measured, as here shown:--TABLE 5/54. Lathyrus odoratus.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  80     :  64 4/8.Pot 2  :  78 4/8 :  63.Total  : 158.5   : 127.5.The two crossed plants here average 79.25, and the two self-fertilised63.75 inches in height, or as 100 to 80. Six flowers on these twocrossed plants were reciprocally crossed with pollen from the otherplant, and the six pods thus produced contained on an average six peas,with a maximum in one of seven. Eighteen spontaneously self-fertilisedpods from the Painted Lady, which, as already stated, had no doubt beenself-fertilised for many previous generations, contained on an averageonly 3.93 peas, with a maximum in one of five peas; so that the numberof peas in the crossed and self-fertilised pods was as 100 to 65. Theself-fertilised peas were, however, quite as heavy as those from thecrossed pods. From these two lots of seeds, the plants of the nextgeneration were raised.PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.Many of the self-fertilised peas just referred to germinated on sandbefore any of the crossed ones, and were rejected. As soon as I gotequal pairs, they were planted on the opposite sides of two large pots,which were kept in the greenhouse. The seedlings thus raised were thegrandchildren of the Painted Lady, which was first crossed by the Purplevariety. When the two lots were from 4 to 6 inches in height there wasno difference between them. Nor was there any marked difference in theperiod of their flowering. When fully grown they were measured, asfollows:--TABLE 5/55. Lathyrus odoratus (Second Generation).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Seedlings from Plants Crossed during the two previousGenerations.Column 3: Seedlings from Plants Self-fertilised during many previousGenerations.Pot 1  :  72 4/8 :  57 4/8.Pot 1  :  71     :  67.Pot 1  :  52 2/8 :  56 2/8.Pot 2  :  81 4/8 :  66 2/8.Pot 2  :  45 2/8 :  38 7/8.Pot 2  :  55     :  46.Total  : 377.50  : 331.86.The average height of the six crossed plants is here 62.91, and that ofthe six self-fertilised 55.31 inches; or as 100 to 88. There was notmuch difference in the fertility of the two lots; the crossed plantshaving produced in the greenhouse thirty-five pods, and theself-fertilised thirty-two pods.Seeds were saved from the self-fertilised flowers on these two lots ofplants, for the sake of ascertaining whether the seedlings thus raisedwould inherit any difference in growth or vigour. It must therefore beunderstood that both lots in the following trial are plants ofself-fertilised parentage; but that in the one lot the plants were thechildren of plants which had been crossed during two previousgenerations, having been before that self-fertilised for manygenerations; and that in the other lot they were the children of plantswhich had not been crossed for very many previous generations. The seedsgerminated on sand and were planted in pairs on the opposite sides offour pots. They were measured, when fully grown, with the followingresult:--TABLE 5/56. Lathyrus odoratus.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants from Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants from Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  72     :  65.Pot 1  :  72     :  61 4/8.Pot 2  :  58     :  64.Pot 2  :  68     :  68 2/8.Pot 2  :  72 4/8 :  56 4/8.Pot 3  :  81     :  60 2/8.Pot 4  :  77 4/8 :  76 4/8.Total  : 501     : 452.The average height of the seven self-fertilised plants, the offspring ofcrossed plants, is 71.57, and that of the seven self-fertilised plants,the offspring of self-fertilised plants, is 64.57; or as 100 to 90. Theself-fertilised plants from the self-fertilised produced rather morepods--namely, thirty-six--than the self-fertilised plants from thecrossed, for these produced only thirty-one pods.A few seeds of the same two lots were sown in the opposite corners of alarge box in which a Brugmansia had long been growing, and in which thesoil was so exhausted that seeds of Ipomoea purpurea would hardlyvegetate; yet the two plants of the sweet-pea which were raisedflourished well. For a long time the self-fertilised plant from theself-fertilised beat the self-fertilised plant from the crossed plant;the former flowered first, and was at one time 77 1/2 inches, whilst thelatter was only 68 1/2 in height; but ultimately the plant from theprevious cross showed its superiority and attained a height of 108 1/2inches, whilst the other was only 95 inches. I also sowed some of thesame two lots of seeds in poor soil in a shady place in a shrubbery.Here again the self-fertilised plants from the self-fertilised for along time exceeded considerably in height those from the previouslycrossed plants; and this may probably be attributed, in the present asin the last case, to these seeds having germinated rather sooner thanthose from the crossed plants; but at the close of the season thetallest of the self-fertilised plants from the crossed plants was 30inches, whilst the tallest of the self-fertilised from theself-fertilised was 29 3/8 inches in height.From the various facts now given we see that plants derived from a crossbetween two varieties of the sweet-pea, which differ in no respectexcept in the colour of their flowers, exceed considerably in height theoffspring from self-fertilised plants, both in the first and secondgenerations. The crossed plants also transmit their superiority inheight and vigour to their self-fertilised offspring.Pisum sativum.The common pea is perfectly fertile when its flowers are protected fromthe visits of insects; I ascertained this with two or three differentvarieties, as did Dr. Ogle with another. But the flowers are likewiseadapted for cross-fertilisation; Mr. Farrer specifies the followingpoints, namely: "The open blossom displaying itself in the mostattractive and convenient position for insects; the conspicuousvexillum; the wings forming an alighting place; the attachment of thewings to the keel, by which any body pressing on the former must pressdown the latter; the staminal tube enclosing nectar, and affording bymeans of its partially free stamen with apertures on each side of itsbase an open passage to an insect seeking the nectar; the moist andsticky pollen placed just where it will be swept out of the apex of thekeel against the entering insect; the stiff elastic style so placed thaton a pressure being applied to the keel it will be pushed upwards out ofthe keel; the hairs on the style placed on that side of the style onlyon which there is space for the pollen, and in such a direction as tosweep it out; and the stigma so placed as to meet an enteringinsect,--all these become correlated parts of one elaborate mechanism,if we suppose that the fertilisation of these flowers is effected by thecarriage of pollen from one to the other." (5/12. 'Nature' October 10,1872 page 479. Hermann Muller gives an elaborate description of theflowers 'Befruchtung' etc. page 247.) Notwithstanding these manifestprovisions for cross-fertilisation, varieties which have been cultivatedfor very many successive generations in close proximity, althoughflowering at the same time, remain pure. I have elsewhere given evidenceon this head, and if required could give more. (5/13. 'Variation ofAnimals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 9 2nd edition volume 1page 348.) There can hardly be a doubt that some of Knight's varieties,which were originally produced by an artificial cross and were veryvigorous, lasted for at least sixty years, and during all these yearswere self-fertilised; for had it been otherwise, they would not havekept true, as the several varieties are generally grown near together.Most of the varieties, however, endure for a shorter period; and thismay be in part due to their weakness of constitution from long-continuedself-fertilisation.It is remarkable, considering that the flowers secrete much nectar andafford much pollen, how seldom they are visited by insects either inEngland, or, as H. Muller remarks, in North Germany. I have observed theflowers for the last thirty years, and in all this time have only thriceseen bees of the proper kind at work (one of them being Bombusmuscorum), such as were sufficiently powerful to depress the keel, so asto get the undersides of their bodies dusted with pollen. These beesvisited several flowers, and could hardly have failed to cross-fertilisethem. Hive-bees and other small kinds sometimes collect pollen from oldand already fertilised flowers, but this is of no account. The rarity ofthe visits of efficient bees to this exotic plant is, I believe, thechief cause of the varieties so seldom intercrossing. That a cross doesoccasionally take place, as might be expected from what has just beenstated, is certain, from the recorded cases of the direct action of thepollen of one variety on the seed-coats of another. (5/14. 'Variation ofAnimals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 11 2nd edition volume 1page 428.) The late Mr. Masters, who particularly attended to theraising of new varieties of peas, was convinced that some of them hadoriginated from accidental crosses. But as such crosses are rare, theold varieties would not often be thus deteriorated, more especially asplants departing from the proper type are generally rejected by thosewho collect seed for sale. There is another cause which probably tendsto render cross-fertilisation rare, namely, the early age at which thepollen-tubes are exserted; eight flowers not fully expanded wereexamined, and in seven of these the pollen-tubes were in this state; butthey had not as yet penetrated the stigma. Although so few insects visitthe flowers of the pea in this country or in North Germany, and althoughthe anthers seem here to open abnormally soon, it does not follow thatthe species in its native country would be thus circumstanced.Owing to the varieties having been self-fertilised for many generations,and to their having been subjected in each generation to nearly the sameconditions (as will be explained in a future chapter) I did not expectthat a cross between two such plants would benefit the offspring; and soit proved on trial. In 1867 I covered up several plants of the EarlyEmperor pea, which was not then a very new variety, so that it mustalready have been propagated by self-fertilisation for at least a dozengenerations. Some flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plantgrowing in the same row, and others were allowed to fertilise themselvesunder a net. The two lots of seeds thus obtained were sown on oppositesides of two large pots, but only four pairs came up at the same time.The pots were kept in the greenhouse. The seedlings of both lots whenbetween 6 and 7 inches in height were equal. When nearly full-grown theywere measured, as in Table 5/57.TABLE 5/57. Pisum sativum.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  35     :  29 6/8.Pot 2  :  31 4/8 :  51.Pot 2  :  35     :  45.Pot 2  :  37     :  33.Total  : 138.50  : 158.75.The average height of the four crossed plants is here 34.62, and that ofthe four self-fertilised plants 39.68, or as 100 to 115. So that thecrossed plants, far from beating the self-fertilised, were completelybeaten by them.There can be no doubt that the result would have been widely different,if any two varieties out of the numberless ones which exist had beencrossed. Notwithstanding that both had been self-fertilised for manyprevious generations, each would almost certainly have possessed its ownpeculiar constitution; and this degree of differentiation would havebeen sufficient to make a cross highly beneficial. I have spoken thusconfidently of the benefit which would have been derived from crossingany two varieties of the pea from the following facts: Andrew Knight inspeaking of the results of crossing reciprocally very tall and shortvarieties, says, "I had in this experiment a striking instance of thestimulative effects of crossing the breeds; for the smallest variety,whose height rarely exceeded 2 feet, was increased to 6 feet; whilst theheight of the large and luxuriant kind was very little diminished."(5/15. 'Philosophical Transactions' 1799 page 200.) Recently Mr. Laxtonhas made numerous crosses, and everyone had been astonished at thevigour and luxuriance of the new varieties which he has thus raised andafterwards fixed by selection. He gave me seed-peas produced fromcrosses between four distinct kinds; and the plants thus raised wereextraordinarily vigorous, being in each case from 1 to 2 or even 3 feettaller than the parent-forms, which were raised at the same time closealongside. But as I did not measure their actual height I cannot givethe exact ratio, but it must have been at least as 100 to 75. A similartrial was subsequently made with two other peas from a different cross,and the result was nearly the same. For instance, a crossed seedlingbetween the Maple and Purple-podded pea was planted in poor soil andgrew to the extraordinary height of 116 inches; whereas the tallestplant of either parent variety, namely, a Purple-podded pea, was only 70inches in height; or as 100 to 60.Sarothamnus scoparius.Bees incessantly visit the flowers of the common Broom, and these areadapted by a curious mechanism for cross-fertilisation. When a beealights on the wing-petals of a young flower, the keel is slightlyopened and the short stamens spring out, which rub their pollen againstthe abdomen of the bee. If a rather older flower is visited for thefirst time (or if the bee exerts great force on a younger flower), thekeel opens along its whole length, and the longer as well as the shorterstamens, together with the much elongated curved pistil, spring forthwith violence. The flattened, spoon-like extremity of the pistil restsfor a time on the back of the bee, and leaves on it the load of pollenwith which it is charged. As soon as the bee flies away, the pistilinstantly curls round, so that the stigmatic surface is now upturned andoccupies a position, in which it would be rubbed against the abdomen ofanother bee visiting the same flower. Thus, when the pistil firstescapes from the keel, the stigma is rubbed against the back of the bee,dusted with pollen from the longer stamens, either of the same oranother flower; and afterwards against the lower surface of the beedusted with pollen from the shorter stamens, which is often shed a dayor two before that from the longer stamens. (5/16. These observationshave been quoted in an abbreviated form by the Reverend G. Henslow, inthe 'Journal of Linnean Society Botany' volume 9 1866 page 358. HermannMuller has since published a full and excellent account of the flower inhis 'Befruchtung' etc. page 240.) By this mechanism cross-fertilisationis rendered almost inevitable, and we shall immediately see that pollenfrom a distinct plant is more effective than that from the same flower.I need only add that, according to H. Muller, the flowers do not secretenectar, and he thinks that bees insert their proboscides only in thehope of finding nectar; but they act in this manner so frequently andfor so long a time that I cannot avoid the belief that they obtainsomething palatable within the flowers.If the visits of bees are prevented, and if the flowers are not dashedby the wind against any object, the keel never opens, so that thestamens and pistil remain enclosed. Plants thus protected yield very fewpods in comparison with those produced by neighbouring uncovered bushes,and sometimes none at all. I fertilised a few flowers on a plant growingalmost in a state of nature with pollen from another plant closealongside, and the four crossed capsules contained on an average 9.2seeds. This large number no doubt was due to the bush being covered up,and thus not exhausted by producing many pods; for fifty pods gatheredfrom an adjoining plant, the flowers of which had been fertilised by thebees, contained an average of only 7.14 seeds. Ninety-three podsspontaneously self-fertilised on a large bush which had been covered up,but had been much agitated by the wind, contained an average of 2.93seeds. Ten of the finest of these ninety-three capsules yielded anaverage of 4.30 seeds, that is less than half the average number in thefour artificially crossed capsules. The ratio of 7.14 to 2.93, or as 100to 41, is probably the fairest for the number of seeds per pod, yieldedby naturally-crossed and spontaneously self-fertilised flowers. Thecrossed seeds compared with an equal number of the spontaneouslyself-fertilised seeds were heavier, in the ratio of 100 to 88. We thussee that besides the mechanical adaptations for cross-fertilisation, theflowers are much more productive with pollen from a distinct plant thanwith their own pollen.Eight pairs of the above crossed and self-fertilised seeds, after theyhad germinated on sand, were planted (1867) on the opposite sides of twolarge pots. When several of the seedlings were an inch and a half inheight, there was no marked difference between the two lots. But even atthis early age the leaves of the self-fertilised seedlings were smallerand of not so bright a green as those of the crossed seedlings. The potswere kept in the greenhouse, and as the plants on the following spring(1868) looked unhealthy and had grown but little, they were plunged,still in their pots, into the open ground. The plants all suffered muchfrom the sudden change, especially the self-fertilised, and two of thelatter died. The remainder were measured, and I give the measurements inTable 5/58, because I have not seen in any other species so great adifference between the crossed and self-fertilised seedlings at so earlyan age.TABLE 5/58.

Itshould be remembered that these plants had been bedded out in theirpots, so that they were subjected to very severe competition. This potwas now thrown away.The six plants in Pot 2 were all alive. One of the self-fertilised wasan inch and a quarter taller than any one of the crossed plants; but theother two self-fertilised plants were in a very poor condition. Itherefore resolved to leave these plants to struggle together for someyears. By the autumn of the same year (1869) the self-fertilised plantwhich had been victorious was now beaten. The measurements are shown inTable 5/59.TABLE 5/59.

The threecrossed plants in Pot 1, as already shown, had beaten the threeself-fertilised plants so completely, that any comparison between themwas superfluous.The winter of 1870-1871 was severe. In the spring the three crossedplants in Pot 2 had not even the tips of their shoots in the leastinjured, whereas all three self-fertilised plants were killed half-waydown to the ground; and this shows how much more tender they were. Inconsequence not one of these latter plants bore a single flower duringthe ensuing summer of 1871, whilst all three crossed plants flowered.Ononis minutissima.This plant, of which seeds were sent me from North Italy, produces,besides the ordinary papilionaceous flowers, minute, imperfect, closedor cleistogene flowers, which can never be cross-fertilised, but arehighly self-fertile. Some of the perfect flowers were crossed withpollen from a distinct plant, and six capsules thus produced yielded onan average 3.66 seeds, with a maximum of five in one. Twelve perfectflowers were marked and allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneouslyunder a net, and they yielded eight capsules, containing on an average2.38 seeds, with a maximum of three seeds in one. So that the crossedand self-fertilised capsules from the perfect flowers yielded seeds inthe proportion of 100 to 65. Fifty-three capsules produced by thecleistogene flowers contained on an average 4.1 seeds, so that thesewere the most productive of all; and the seeds themselves looked finereven than those from the crossed perfect flowers.The seeds from the crossed perfect flowers and from the self-fertilisedcleistogene flowers were allowed to germinate on sand; but unfortunatelyonly two pairs germinated at the same time. These were planted on theopposite sides of the same pot, which was kept in the greenhouse. In thesummer of the same year, when the seedlings were about 4 1/2 inches inheight, the two lots were equal. In the autumn of the following year(1868) the two crossed plants were of exactly the same height, namely,11 4/8 inches, and the two self-fertilised plants 12 6/8 and 7 2/8inches; so that one of the self-fertilised exceeded considerably inheight all the others. By the autumn of 1869 the two crossed plants hadacquired the supremacy; their height being 16 4/8 and 15 1/8, whilstthat of the two self-fertilised plants was 14 5/8 and 11 4/8 inches.By the autumn of 1870, the heights were as follows:--TABLE 5/61. Ononis minutissima.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Crossed Plants.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants.       :  20 3/8 :  17 4/8.       :  19 2/8 :  17 2/8.Total  :  39.63  :  34.75.So that the mean height of the two crossed plants was 19.81, and that ofthe two self-fertilised 17.37 inches; or as 100 to 88. It should beremembered that the two lots were at first equal in height; that one ofthe self-fertilised plants then had the advantage, the two crossedplants being at last victorious.]SUMMARY ON THE LEGUMINOSAE.Six genera in this family were experimented on, and the results are insome respects remarkable. The crossed plants of the two species ofLupinus were conspicuously superior to the self-fertilised plants inheight and fertility; and when grown under very unfavourable conditions,in vigour. The scarlet-runner (Phaseolus multiflorus) is partiallysterile if the visits of bees are prevented, and there is reason tobelieve that varieties growing near one another intercross. The fivecrossed plants, however, exceeded in height the five self-fertilisedonly by a little. Phaseolus vulgaris is perfectly self-sterile;nevertheless, varieties growing in the same garden sometimes intercrosslargely. The varieties of Lathyrus odoratus, on the other hand, appearnever to intercross in this country; and though the flowers are notoften visited by efficient insects, I cannot account for this fact, moreespecially as the varieties are believed to intercross in North Italy.Plants raised from a cross between two varieties, differing only in thecolour of their flowers, grew much taller and were under unfavourableconditions more vigorous than the self-fertilised plants; they alsotransmitted, when self-fertilised, their superiority to their offspring.The many varieties of the common Pea (Pisum sativum), though growing inclose proximity, very seldom intercross; and this seems due to therarity in this country of the visits of bees sufficiently powerful toeffect cross-fertilisation. A cross between the self-fertilisedindividuals of the same variety does no good whatever to the offspring;whilst a cross between distinct varieties, though closely allied, doesgreat good, of which we have excellent evidence. The flowers of theBroom (Sarothamnus) are almost sterile if they are not disturbed and ifinsects are excluded. The pollen from a distinct plant is more effectivethan that from the same flower in producing seeds. The crossed seedlingshave an enormous advantage over the self-fertilised when grown togetherin close competition. Lastly, only four plants of the Ononis minutissimawere raised; but as these were observed during their whole growth, theadvantage of the crossed over the self-fertilised plants may, I think,be fully trusted.[15. ONAGRACEAE.--Clarkia elegans.Owing to the season being very unfavourable (1867), few of the flowerswhich I fertilised formed capsules; twelve crossed flowers produced onlyfour, and eighteen self-fertilised flowers yielded only one capsule. Theseeds after germinating on sand were planted in three pots, but all theself-fertilised plants died in one of them. When the two lots werebetween 4 and 5 inches in height, the crossed began to show a slightsuperiority over the self-fertilised. When in full flower they weremeasured, with the following result:--TABLE 5/62. Clarkia elegans.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  40 4/8 :  33.Pot 1  :  35     :  24.Pot 1  :  25     :  23.Pot 2  :  33 4/8 :  30 4/8.Total  : 134.0   : 110.5.The average height of the four crossed plants is 33.5, and that of thefour self-fertilised plants 27.62 inches, or as 100 to 82. The crossedplants altogether produced 105 and the self-fertilised plants 63capsules; or as 100 to 60. In both pots a self-fertilised plant floweredbefore any one of the crossed plants.16. LOASACEAE.--Bartonia aurea.Some flowers were crossed and self-fertilised in the usual manner duringtwo seasons; but as I reared on the first occasion only two pairs, theresults are given together. On both occasions the crossed capsulescontained slightly more seeds than the self-fertilised. During the firstyear, when the plants were about 7 inches in height, the self-fertilisedwere the tallest, and in the second year the crossed were the tallest.When the two lots were in full flower they were measured, as in Table5/63.TABLE 5/63. Bartonia aurea.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  31     :  37.Pot 2  :  18 4/8 :  20 4/8.Pot 3  :  19 4/8 :  40 4/8.Pot 4  :  25     :  35.Pot 4  :  36     :  15 4/8.Pot 5  :  31     :  18.Pot 5  :  16     :  11 4/8.Pot 6  :  20     :  32 4/8.Total  : 197.0   : 210.5.The average height of the eight crossed plants is 24.62, and that of theeight self-fertilised 26.31 inches; or as 100 to 107. So that theself-fertilised had a decided advantage over the crossed. But the plantsfrom some cause never grew well, and finally became so unhealthy thatonly three crossed and three self-fertilised plants survived to set anycapsules, and these were few in number. The two lots seemed to be aboutequally unproductive.17. PASSIFLORACEAE.--Passiflora gracilis.This annual species produces spontaneously numerous fruits when insectsare excluded, and behaves in this respect very differently from most ofthe other species in the genus, which are extremely sterile unlessfertilised with pollen from a distinct plant. (5/17. 'Variation ofAnimals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2page 118.) Fourteen fruits from crossed flowers contained on an average24.14 seeds. Fourteen fruits (two poor ones being rejected),spontaneously self-fertilised under a net, contained on an average 20.58seeds per fruit; or as 100 to 85. These seeds were sown on the oppositesides of three pots, but only two pairs came up at the same time; andtherefore a fair judgment cannot be formed.TABLE 5/64. Passiflora gracilis.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  56     :  38.Pot 2  :  42     :  64.Total  :  98     : 102.The mean of the two crossed is 49 inches, and that of the twoself-fertilised 51 inches; or as 100 to 104.18. UMBELLIFERAE.--Apium petroselinum.The Umbelliferae are proterandrous, and can hardly fail to becross-fertilised by the many flies and small Hymenoptera which visit theflowers. (5/18. Hermann Muller 'Befruchtung' etc. page 96. According toM. Mustel as stated by Godron 'De l'esp�ce' tome 2 page 58 1859,varieties of the carrot growing near each other readily intercross.) Aplant of the common parsley was covered by a net, and it apparentlyproduced as many and as fine spontaneously self-fertilised fruits orseeds as the adjoining uncovered plants. The flowers on the latter werevisited by so many insects that they must have received pollen from oneanother. Some of these two lots of seeds were left on sand, but nearlyall the self-fertilised seeds germinated before the others, so that Iwas forced to throw all away. The remaining seeds were then sown on theopposite sides of four pots. At first the self-fertilised seedlings werea little taller in most of the pots than the naturally crossedseedlings, and this no doubt was due to the self-fertilised seeds havinggerminated first. But in the autumn all the plants were so equal that itdid not seem worth while to measure them. In two of the pots they wereabsolutely equal; in a third, if there was any difference, it was infavour of the crossed plants, and in a somewhat plainer manner in thefourth pot. But neither side had any substantial advantage over theother; so that in height they may be said to be as 100 to 100.19. DIPSACEAE.--Scabiosa atro-purpurea.The flowers, which are proterandrous, were fertilised during theunfavourable season of 1867, so that I got few seeds, especially fromthe self-fertilised heads, which were extremely sterile. The crossed andself-fertilised plants raised from these seeds were measured before theywere in full flower, as in Table 5/65.TABLE 5/65. Scabiosa atro-purpurea.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  14     :  20.Pot 2  :  15     :  14 4/8.Pot 3  :  21     :  14.Pot 3  :  18 4/8 :  13.Total  :  68.5   :  61.5.The four crossed plants averaged 17.12, and the four self-fertilised15.37 inches in height; or as 100 to 90. One of the self-fertilisedplants in Pot 3 was killed by an accident, and its fellow pulled up; sothat when they were again measured to the summits of their flowers,there were only three on each side; the crossed now averaged in height32.83, and the self-fertilised 30.16 inches; or as 100 to 92.20. COMPOSITAE.--Lactuca sativa. (5/19. The Compositae are well-adaptedfor cross-fertilisation, but a nurseryman on whom I can rely, told methat he had been in the habit of sowing several kinds of lettuce neartogether for the sake of seed, and had never observed that they becamecrossed. It is very improbable that all the varieties which were thuscultivated near together flowered at different times; but two which Iselected by hazard and sowed near each other did not flower at the sametime; and my trial failed.)Three plants of Lettuce (Great London Cos var.) grew close together inmy garden; one was covered by a net, and produced self-fertilised seeds,the other two were allowed to be naturally crossed by insects; but theseason (1867) was unfavourable, and I did not obtain many seeds. Onlyone crossed and one self-fertilised plant were raised in Pot 1, andtheir measurements are given in Table 5/66. The flowers on this oneself-fertilised plant were again self-fertilised under a net, not withpollen from the same floret, but from other florets on the same head.The flowers on the two crossed plants were left to be crossed byinsects, but the process was aided by some pollen being occasionallytransported by me from plant to plant. These two lots of seeds, aftergerminating on sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of Pots2 and 3, which were at first kept in the greenhouse and then turned outof doors. The plants were measured when in full flower. Table 5/66,therefore, includes plants belonging to two generations. When theseedlings of the two lots were only 5 or 6 inches in height they wereequal. In Pot 3 one of the self-fertilised plants died before flowering,as has occurred in so many other cases.TABLE 5/66.

CAMPANULACEAE.--Specularia speculum.In the closely allied genus, Campanula, in which Specularia was formerlyincluded, the anthers shed at an early period their pollen, and thisadheres to the collecting hairs which surround the pistil beneath thestigma; so that without some mechanical aid the flowers cannot befertilised. For instance, I covered up a plant of Campanula carpathica,and it did not produce a single capsule, whilst the surroundinguncovered plants seeded profusely. On the other hand, the presentspecies of Specularia appears to set almost as many capsules whencovered up, as when left to the visits of the Diptera, which, as far asI have seen, are the only insects that frequent the flowers. (5/20. Ithas long been known that another species of the genus, Speculariaperfoliata, produces cleistogene as well as perfect flowers, and theformer are of course self-fertile.) I did not ascertain whether thenaturally crossed and spontaneously self-fertilised capsules containedan equal number of seeds, but a comparison of artificially crossed andself-fertilised flowers, showed that the former were probably the mostproductive. It appears that this plant is capable of producing a largenumber of self-fertilised capsules owing to the petals closing at night,as well as during cold weather. In the act of closing, the margins ofthe petals become reflexed, and their inwardly projecting midribs thenpass between the clefts of the stigma, and in doing so push the pollenfrom the outside of the pistil on to the stigmatic surfaces. (5/21. Mr.Meehan has lately shown 'Proceedings of the Academy of Natural SciencePhiladelphia' May 16, 1876 page 84, that the closing of the flowers ofClaytonia virginica and Ranunculus bulbosus during the night causestheir self-fertilisation.)Twenty flowers were fertilised by me with their own pollen, but owing tothe bad season, only six capsules were produced; they contained on anaverage 21.7 seeds, with a maximum of forty-eight in one. Fourteenflowers were crossed with pollen from another plant, and these producedtwelve capsules, containing on an average 30 seeds, with a maximum inone of fifty-seven seeds; so that the crossed seeds were to theself-fertilised from an equal number of capsules as 100 to 72. Theformer were also heavier than an equal number of self-fertilised seeds,in the ratio of 100 to 86. Thus, whether we judge by the number ofcapsules produced from an equal number of flowers, or by the averagenumber of the contained seeds, or the maximum number in any one capsule,or by their weight, crossing does great good in comparison withself-fertilisation. The two lots of seeds were sown on the oppositesides of four pots; but the seedlings were not sufficiently thinned.Only the tallest plant on each side was measured, when fully grown. Themeasurements are given in Table 5/67. In all four pots the crossedplants flowered first. When the seedlings were only about an inch and ahalf in height both lots were equal.TABLE 5/67. Specularia speculum.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Tallest Crossed Plant in each Pot.Column 3: Tallest Self-fertilised Plant in each Pot.Pot 1  :  18     :  15 6/8.Pot 2  :  17     :  19.Pot 3  :  22 1/8 :  18.Pot 4  :  20     :  23.Total  :  77.13  :  75.75.The four tallest crossed plants averaged 19.28, and the four tallestself-fertilised 18.93 inches in height; or as 100 to 98. So that therewas no difference worth speaking of between the two lots in height;though other great advantages are derived, as we have seen, fromcross-fertilisation. From being grown in pots and kept in thegreenhouse, none of the plants produced any capsules.Lobelia ramosa. (5/22. I have adopted the name given to this plant inthe 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1866. Professor T. Dyer, however, informs methat it probably is a white variety of L. tenuior of R. Brown, from W.Australia.)VAR. SNOW-FLAKE.The well-adapted means by which cross-fertilisation is ensured in thisgenus have been described by several authors. (5/23. See the works ofHildebrand and Delpino. Mr. Farrer also has given a remarkably cleardescription of the mechanism by which cross-fertilisation is effected inthis genus, in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 2 4thseries 1868 page 260. In the allied genus Isotoma, the curious spikewhich projects rectangularly from the anthers, and which when shakencauses the pollen to fall on the back of an entering insect, seems tohave been developed from a bristle, like one of those which spring fromthe anthers in some of or all the species of Lobelia, as described byMr. Farrer.) The pistil as it slowly increases in length pushes thepollen out of the conjoined anthers, by the aid of a ring of bristles;the two lobes of the stigma being at this time closed and incapable offertilisation. The extrusion of the pollen is also aided by insects,which rub against the little bristles that project from the anthers. Thepollen thus pushed out is carried by insects to the older flowers, inwhich the stigma of the now freely projecting pistil is open and readyto be fertilised. I proved the importance of the gaily-coloured corolla,by cutting off the large flowers of Lobelia erinus; and these flowerswere neglected by the hive-bees which were incessantly visiting theother flowers.A capsule was obtained by crossing a flower of L. ramosa with pollenfrom another plant, and two other capsules from artificiallyself-fertilised flowers. The contained seeds were sown on the oppositesides of four pots. Some of the crossed seedlings which came up beforethe others had to be pulled up and thrown away. Whilst the plants werevery small there was not much difference in height between the two lots;but in Pot 3 the self-fertilised were for a time the tallest. When infull flower the tallest plant on each side of each pot was measured, andthe result is shown in Table 5/68. In all four pots a crossed plantflowered before any one of its opponents.TABLE 5/68. Lobelia ramosa (First Generation).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Tallest Crossed Plant in each Pot.Column 3: Tallest Self-fertilised Plant in each Pot.Pot 1  :  22 4/8 :  17 4/8.Pot 2  :  27 4/8 :  24.Pot 3  :  16 4/8 :  15.Pot 4  :  22 4/8 :  17.Total  :  89.0   :  73.5.The four tallest crossed plants averaged 22.25, and the four tallestself-fertilised 18.37 inches in height; or as 100 to 82. I was surprisedto find that the anthers of a good many of these self-fertilised plantsdid not cohere and did not contain any pollen; and the anthers even of avery few of the crossed plants were in the same condition. Some flowerson the crossed plants were again crossed, four capsules being thusobtained; and some flowers on the self-fertilised plants were againself-fertilised, seven capsules being thus obtained. The seeds from bothlots were weighed, and it was calculated that an equal number ofcapsules would have yielded seed in the proportion by weight of 100 forthe crossed to 60 for the self-fertilised capsules. So that the flowerson the crossed plants again crossed were much more fertile than those onthe self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised.PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.The above two lots of seeds were placed on damp sand, and many of thecrossed seeds germinated, as on the last occasion, before theself-fertilised, and were rejected. Three or four pairs in the samestate of germination were planted on the opposite sides of two pots; asingle pair in a third pot; and all the remaining seeds were sowncrowded in a fourth pot. When the seedlings were about one and a halfinches in height, they were equal on both sides of the three first pots;but in Pot 4, in which they grew crowded and were thus exposed to severecompetition, the crossed were about a third taller than theself-fertilised. In this latter pot, when the crossed averaged 5 inchesin height, the self-fertilised were about 4 inches; nor did they looknearly such fine plants. In all four pots the crossed plants floweredsome days before the self-fertilised. When in full flower the tallestplant on each side was measured; but before this time the single crossedplant in Pot 3, which was taller than its antagonist, had died and wasnot measured. So that only the tallest plant on each side of three potswas measured, as in Table 5/69.TABLE 5/69. Lobelia ramosa (Second Generation).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Tallest Crossed Plant in each Pot.Column 3: Tallest Self-fertilised Plant in each Pot.Pot 1  :  27 4/8 :  18 4/8.Pot 2  :  21     :  19 4/8.Pot 3  :  21 4/8 :  19.Crowded.Total  :  70     :  57.The average height of the three tallest crossed plants is here 23.33,and that of the tallest self-fertilised 19 inches; or as 100 to 81.Besides this difference in height, the crossed plants were much morevigorous and more branched than the self-fertilised plants, and it isunfortunate that they were not weighed.Lobelia fulgens.This species offers a somewhat perplexing case. In the first generationthe self-fertilised plants, though few in number, greatly exceeded thecrossed in height; whilst in the second generation, when the trial wasmade on a much larger scale, the crossed beat the self-fertilisedplants. As this species is generally propagated by off-sets, someseedlings were first raised, in order to have distinct plants. On one ofthese plants several flowers were fertilised with their own pollen; andas the pollen is mature and shed long before the stigma of the sameflower is ready for fertilisation, it was necessary to number eachflower and keep its pollen in paper with a corresponding number. By thismeans well-matured pollen was used for self-fertilisation. Severalflowers on the same plant were crossed with pollen from a distinctindividual, and to obtain this the conjoined anthers of young flowerswere roughly squeezed, and as it is naturally protruded very slowly bythe growth of the pistil, it is probable that the pollen used by me washardly mature, certainly less mature than that employed forself-fertilisation. I did not at the time think of this source of error,but I now suspect that the growth of the crossed plants was thusinjured. Anyhow the trial was not perfectly fair. Opposed to the beliefthat the pollen used in crossing was not in so good a state as that usedfor self-fertilisation, is the fact that a greater proportional numberof the crossed than of the self-fertilised flowers produced capsules;but there was no marked difference in the amount of seed contained inthe capsules of the two lots. (5/24. Gartner has shown that certainplants of Lobelia fulgens are quite sterile with pollen from the sameplant, though this pollen is efficient on any other individual; but noneof the plants on which I experimented, which were kept in thegreenhouse, were in this peculiar condition.)As the seeds obtained by the above two methods would not germinate whenleft on bare sand, they were sown on the opposite sides of four pots;but I succeeded in raising only a single pair of seedlings of the sameage in each pot. The self-fertilised seedlings, when only a few inchesin height, were in most of the pots taller than their opponents; andthey flowered so much earlier in all the pots, that the height of theflower-stems could be fairly compared only in Pots 1 and 2.TABLE 5/70. Lobelia fulgens (First Generation).Heights of flower-stems measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Height of Flower-stems on the Crossed Plants.Column 3: Height of Flower-stems on the Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :  33     :  50.Pot 2  :  36 4/8 :  38 4/8.Pot 3  :  21*    :  43.Pot 4  :  12*    :  35 6/8.*Not in full flower.The mean height of the flower-stems of the two crossed plants in Pots 1and 2 is here 34.75 inches, and that of the two self-fertilised plantsin the same pots 44.25 inches; or as 100 to 127. The self-fertilisedplants in Pots 3 and 4 were in every respect very much finer than thecrossed plants.I was so much surprised at this great superiority of the self-fertilisedover the crossed plants, that I determined to try how they would behavein one of the pots during a second growth. The two plants, therefore, inPot 1 were cut down, and repotted without being disturbed in a muchlarger pot. In the following year the self-fertilised plant showed evena greater superiority than before; for the two tallest flower-stemsproduced by the one crossed plant were only 29 4/8 and 30 1/8 inches inheight, whereas the two tallest stems on the one self-fertilised plantwere 49 4/8 and 49 6/8 inches; and this gives a ratio of 100 to 167.Considering all the evidence, there can be no doubt that theseself-fertilised plants had a great superiority over the crossed plants.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.TABLE 5/71.

Several flowers on the crossed plant in Pot 1 in Table 5/70were again crossed with pollen from a distinct plant. Several otherflowers on the self-fertilised plant in the same pot were againself-fertilised with pollen from the anthers of other flowers on theSAME PLANT. Therefore the degree of self-fertilisation was not quite soclose as in the last generation, in which pollen from the SAME FLOWER,kept in paper, was used. These two lots of seeds were thinly sown onopposite sides of nine pots; and the young seedlings were thinned, anequal number of nearly as possible the same age being left on the twosides. In the spring of the following year (1870), when the seedlingshad grown to a considerable size, they were measured to the tips oftheir leaves; and the twenty-three crossed plants averaged 14.04 inchesin height, whilst the twenty-three self-fertilised seedlings were 13.54inches; or as 100 to 96.In the summer of the same year several of these plants flowered, thecrossed and self-fertilised plants flowering almost simultaneously, andall the flower-stems were measured. Those produced by eleven of thecrossed plants averaged 30.71 inches, and those by nine of theself-fertilised plants 29.43 inches in height; or as 100 to 96.The plants in these nine pots, after they had flowered, were repottedwithout being disturbed in much larger pots; and in the following year,1871, all flowered freely; but they had grown into such an entangledmass, that the separate plants on each side could no longer bedistinguished. Accordingly three or four of the tallest flower-stems oneach side of each pot were measured; and the measurements in Table 5/71are, I think, more trustworthy than the previous ones, from being morenumerous, and from the plants being well established and growingvigorously.The average height of the thirty-four tallest flower-stems on thetwenty-three crossed plants is 29.82 inches, and that of the same numberof flower-stems on the same number of self-fertilised plants is 27.10inches, or as 100 to 91. So that the crossed plants now showed a decidedadvantage over their self-fertilised opponents.22. POLEMONIACEAE.--Nemophila insignis.Twelve flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant, butproduced only six capsules, containing on an average 18.3 seeds.Eighteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced tencapsules, containing on an average 12.7 seeds, so that the seeds percapsule were as 100 to 69. (5/25. Several species of Polemoniaceae areknown to be proterandrous, but I did not attend to this point inNemophila. Verlot says 'Des Vari�t�s' 1865 page 66, that varietiesgrowing near one another spontaneously intercross.) The crossed seedsweighed a little less than an equal number of self-fertilised seeds, inthe proportion of 100 to 105; but this was clearly due to some of theself-fertilised capsules containing very few seeds, and these were muchbulkier than the others, from having been better nourished. A subsequentcomparison of the number of seeds in a few capsules did not show sogreat a superiority on the side of the crossed capsules as in thepresent case.The seeds were placed on sand, and after germinating were planted inpairs on the opposite sides of five pots, which were kept in thegreenhouse. When the seedlings were from 2 to 3 inches in height, mostof the crossed had a slight advantage over the self-fertilised. Theplants were trained up sticks, and thus grew to a considerable height.In four out of the five pots a crossed plant flowered before any one ofthe self-fertilised. The plants were first measured to the tips of theirleaves, before they had flowered and when the crossed were under a footin height. The twelve crossed plants averaged 11.1 inches in height,whilst the twelve self-fertilised were less than half of this height,namely, 5.45; or as 100 to 49. Before the plants had grown to their fullheight, two of the self-fertilised died, and as I feared that this mighthappen with others, they were again measured to the tops of their stems,as shown in Table 5/72.TABLE 5/72.

The pots were rather small, and the plants did notproduce many capsules. The small size of the self-fertilised plants willlargely account for the fewness of the capsules which they produced. Thesix crossed plants bore 105, and the six self-fertilised only 30capsules; or as 100 to 29.The self-fertilised seeds thus obtained from the crossed andself-fertilised plants, after germinating on sand, were planted on theopposite sides of four small pots, and treated as before. But many ofthe plants were unhealthy, and their heights were so unequal--some onboth sides being five times as tall as the others--that the averagesdeduced from the measurements in Table 5/73 are not in the leasttrustworthy. Nevertheless I have felt bound to give them, as they areopposed to my general conclusions.The seven self-fertilised plants from the crossed plants here average15.73, and the seven self-fertilised from the self-fertilised 21 inchesin height; or as 100 to 133. Strictly analogous experiments with Violatricolor and Lathyrus odoratus gave a very different result.TABLE 5/73.

BORAGINACEAE.--Borago officinalis.This plant is frequented by a greater number of bees than any other onewhich I have observed. It is strongly proterandrous (H. Muller'Befruchtung' etc. page 267), and the flowers can hardly fail to becross-fertilised; but should this not occur, they are capable ofself-fertilisation to a limited extent, as some pollen long remainswithin the anthers, and is apt to fall on the mature stigma. In the year1863 I covered up a plant, and examined thirty-five flowers, of whichonly twelve yielded any seeds; whereas of thirty-five flowers on anexposed plant growing close by, all with the exception of two yieldedseeds. The covered-up plant, however, produced altogether twenty-fivespontaneously self-fertilised seeds; the exposed plant producingfifty-five seeds, the product, no doubt, of cross-fertilisation.In the year 1868 eighteen flowers on a protected plant were crossed withpollen from a distinct plant, but only seven of these produced fruit;and I suspect that I applied pollen to many of the stigmas before theywere mature. These fruits contained on an average 2 seeds, with amaximum in one of three seeds. Twenty-four spontaneously self-fertilisedfruits were produced by the same plant, and these contained on anaverage 1.2 seeds, with a maximum of two in one fruit. So that thefruits from the artificially crossed flowers yielded seeds compared withthose from the spontaneously self-fertilised flowers, in the ratio of100 to 60. But the self-fertilised seeds, as often occurs when few areproduced, were heavier than the crossed seeds in the ratio of 100 to 90.These two lots of seeds were sown on opposite sides of two large pots;but I succeeded in raising only four pairs of equal age. When theseedlings on both sides were about 8 inches in height they were equal.When in full flower they were measured, as follows:--TABLE 5/74. Borago officinalis.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   19     :  13 4/8.Pot 1  :   21     :  18 6/8.Pot 1  :   16 4/8 :  20 2/8.Pot 2  :   26 2/8 :  32 2/8.Total  :   82.75  :  84.75.The average height of the four crossed plants is here 20.68, and that ofthe four self-fertilised 21.18 inches; or as 100 to 102. Theself-fertilised plants thus exceeded the crossed in height by a little;but this was entirely due to the tallness of one of the self-fertilised.The crossed plants in both pots flowered before the self-fertilised.Therefore I believe if more plants had been raised, the result wouldhave been different. I regret that I did not attend to the fertility ofthe two lots.24. NOLANACEAE.--Nolana prostrata.In some of the flowers the stamens are considerably shorter than thepistil, in others equal to it in length. I suspected, therefore, buterroneously as it proved, that this plant was dimorphic, like Primula,Linum, etc., and in the year 1862 twelve plants, covered by a net in thegreenhouse, were subjected to trial. The spontaneously self-fertilisedflowers yielded 64 grains weight of seeds, but the product of fourteenartificially crossed flowers is here included, which falsely increasesthe weight of the self-fertilised seeds. Nine uncovered plants, theflowers of which were eagerly visited by bees for their pollen and wereno doubt intercrossed by them, produced 79 grains weight of seeds:therefore twelve plants thus treated would have yielded 105 grains. Thusthe seeds produced by the flowers on an equal number of plants, whencrossed by bees, and spontaneously self-fertilised (the product offourteen artificially crossed flowers being, however, included in thelatter) were in weight as 100 to 61.In the summer of 1867 the trial was repeated; thirty flowers werecrossed with pollen from a distinct plant and produced twenty-sevencapsules, each containing five seeds. Thirty-two flowers were fertilisedwith their own pollen, and produced only six capsules, each with fiveseeds. So that the crossed and self-fertilised capsules contained thesame number of seeds, though many more capsules were produced by thecross-fertilised than by the self-fertilised flowers, in the ratio of100 to 21.An equal number of seeds of both lots were weighed, and the crossedseeds were to the self-fertilised in weight as 100 to 82. Therefore across increases the number of capsules produced and the weight of theseeds, but not the number of seeds in each capsule.These two lots of seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted on theopposite sides of three pots. The seedlings when from 6 to 7 inches inheight were equal. The plants were measured when fully grown, but theirheights were so unequal in the several pots, that the result cannot befully trusted.TABLE 5/75.

SOLANACEAE. Petunia violacea.DINGY PURPLE VARIETY.The flowers of this plant are so seldom visited during the day byinsects in this country, that I have never seen an instance; but mygardener, on whom I can rely, once saw some humble-bees at work. Mr.Meehan says, that in the United States bees bore through the corolla forthe nectar, and adds that their "fertilisation is carried on bynight-moths." (6/1. 'Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science ofPhiladelphia' August 2, 1870 page 90.)In France M. Naudin, after castrating a large number of flowers whilstin bud, left them exposed to the visits of insects, and about a quarterproduced capsules (6/2. 'Annales des Sc. Nat.' 4th series Bot. Tome 9cah. 5); but I am convinced that a much larger proportion of flowers inmy garden are cross-fertilised by insects, for protected flowers withtheir own pollen placed on the stigma never yielded nearly a fullcomplement of seed; whilst those left uncovered produced fine capsules,showing that pollen from other plants must have been brought to them,probably by moths. Plants growing vigorously and flowering in pots inthe greenhouse, never yielded a single capsule; and this may beattributed, at least in chief part, to the exclusion of moths.Six flowers on a plant covered by a net were crossed with pollen from adistinct plant and produced six capsules, containing by weight 4.44grains of seed. Six other flowers were fertilised with their own pollenand produced only three capsules, containing only 1.49 grains weight ofseed. From this it follows that an equal number of crossed andself-fertilised capsules would have contained seeds by weight as 100 to67. I should not have thought the proportional contents of so fewcapsules worth giving, had not nearly the same result been confirmed byseveral subsequent trials.Seeds of the two lots were placed on sand, and many of theself-fertilised seeds germinated before the crossed, and were rejected.Several pairs in an equal state of germination were planted on theopposite sides of Pots 1 and 2; but only the tallest plant on each sidewas measured. Seeds were also sown thickly on the two sides of a largepot (3), the seedlings being afterwards thinned, so that an equal numberwas left on each side; the three tallest on each side being measured.The pots were kept in the greenhouse, and the plants were trained upsticks. For some time the young crossed plants had no advantage inheight over the self-fertilised; but their leaves were larger. Whenfully grown and in flower the plants were measured, as follows:--TABLE 6/76. Petunia violacea (first generation).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   30     :  20 4/8.Pot 2  :   34 4/8 :  27 4/8.Pot 3  :   34     :  28 4/8.Pot 3  :   30 4/8 :  27 4/8.Pot 3  :   25     :  26.Total  :  154     : 130.The five tallest crossed plants here average 30.8, and the five tallestself-fertilised 26 inches in height, or as 100 to 84.Three capsules were obtained by crossing flowers on the above crossedplants, and three other capsules by again self-fertilising flowers onthe self-fertilised plants. One of the latter capsules appeared as fineas any one of the crossed capsules; but the other two contained manyimperfect seeds. From these two lots of seeds the plants of thefollowing generation were raised.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.As in the last generation, many of the self-fertilised seeds germinatedbefore the crossed.Seeds in an equal state of germination were planted on the oppositesides of three pots. The crossed seedlings soon greatly exceeded inheight the self-fertilised. In Pot 1, when the tallest crossed plant was10 1/2 inches high, the tallest self-fertilised was only 3 1/2 inches;in Pot 2 the excess in height of the crossed was not quite so great. Theplants were treated as in the last generation, and when fully grownmeasured as before. In Pot 3 both the crossed plants were killed at anearly age by some animal, so that the self-fertilised had nocompetitors. Nevertheless these two self-fertilised plants weremeasured, and are included in Table 6/77. The crossed plants floweredlong before their self-fertilised opponents in Pots 1 and 2, and beforethose growing separately in Pot 3.TABLE 6/77. Petunia violacea (Second generation).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   57 2/8 :  13 4/8.Pot 1  :   36 2/8 :   8.Pot 2  :   44 4/8 :  33 2/8.Pot 2  :   24     :  28.Pot 3  :    0     :  46 2/8.Pot 3  :    0     :  28 4/8.Total  :  162.0   : 157.5.The four crossed plants average 40.5, and the six self-fertilised 26.25inches in height; or as 100 to 65. But this great inequality is in partaccidental, owing to some of the self-fertilised plants being veryshort, and to one of the crossed being very tall.Twelve flowers on these crossed plants were again crossed, and elevencapsules were produced; of these, five were poor and six good; thelatter contained by weight 3.75 grains of seeds. Twelve flowers on theself-fertilised plants were again fertilised with their own pollen andproduced no less than twelve capsules, and the six finest of thesecontained by weight 2.57 grains of seeds. It should however be observedthat these latter capsules were produced by the plants in Pot 3, whichwere not exposed to any competition. The seeds in the six fine crossedcapsules to those in the six finest self-fertilised capsules were inweight as 100 to 68. From these seeds the plants of the next generationwere raised.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE THIRD GENERATION.TABLE 6/78. Petunia violacea (third generation; plants very young).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :    1 4/8 :   5 6/8.Pot 1  :    1     :   4 4/8.Pot 2  :    5 7/8 :   8 3/8.Pot 2  :    5 6/8 :   6 7/8.Pot 3  :    4     :   5 5/8.Pot 4  :    1 4/8 :   5 3/8.Total  :   19.63  :  36.50.The above seeds were placed on sand, and after germinating were plantedin pairs on the opposite sides of four pots; and all the remaining seedswere thickly sown on the two sides of a fifth large pot. The result wassurprising, for the self-fertilised seedlings very early in life beatthe crossed, and at one time were nearly double their height. At firstthe case appeared like that of Mimulus, in which after the thirdgeneration a tall and highly self-fertile variety appeared. But as inthe two succeeding generations the crossed plants resumed their formersuperiority over the self-fertilised, the case must be looked at as ananomaly. The sole conjecture which I can form is that the crossed seedshad not been sufficiently ripened, and thus produced weakly plants, asoccurred with Iberis. When the crossed plants were between 3 and 4inches in height, the six finest in four of the pots were measured tothe summits of their stems, and at the same time the six finest of theself-fertilised plants. The measurements are given in Table 6/78, and itmay be here seen that all the self-fertilised plants exceed theiropponents in height, whereas when subsequently measured the excess ofthe self-fertilised depended chiefly on the unusual tallness of two ofthe plants in Pot 2. The crossed plants here average 3.27, and theself-fertilised 6.08 inches in height; or as 100 to 186.When fully grown they were again measured, as follows:--TABLE 6/79. Petunia violacea (third generation; plants fully grown).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   41 4/8 :  40 6/8.Pot 1  :   48     :  39.Pot 1  :   36     :  48.Pot 2  :   36     :  47.Pot 2  :   21     :  80 2/8.Pot 2  :   36 2/8 :  86 2/8.Pot 3  :   52     :  46.Pot 4  :   57     :  43 6/8.Total  :  327.75  : 431.00.The eight crossed plants now averaged 40.96, and the eightself-fertilised plants 53.87 inches in height, or as 100 to 131; andthis excess chiefly depended, as already stated, on the unusual tallnessof two of the self-fertilised plants in Pot 2. The self-fertilised hadtherefore lost some of their former great superiority over the crossedplants. In three of the pots the self-fertilised plants flowered first;but in Pot 3 at the same time with the crossed.The case is rendered the more strange, because the crossed plants in thefifth pot (not included in the two last tables), in which all theremaining seeds had been thickly sown, were from the first finer plantsthan the self-fertilised, and had larger leaves. At the period when thetwo tallest crossed plants in this pot were 6 4/8 and 4 5/8 inches high,the two tallest self-fertilised were only 4 inches. When the two crossedplants were 12 and 10 inches high, the two self-fertilised were only 8inches. These latter plants, as well as many others on the same side ofthis pot never grew any higher, whereas several of the crossed plantsgrew to the height of two feet! On account of this great superiority ofthe crossed plants, the plants on neither side of this pot have beenincluded in the two last tables.Thirty flowers on the crossed plants in Pots 1 and 4 (Table 6/79) wereagain crossed, and produced seventeen capsules. Thirty flowers on theself-fertilised plants in the same two pots were again self-fertilised,but produced only seven capsules. The contents of each capsule of bothlots were placed in separate watch-glasses, and the seeds from thecrossed appeared to the eye to be at least double the number of thosefrom the self-fertilised capsules.In order to ascertain whether the fertility of the self-fertilisedplants had been lessened by the plants having been self-fertilised forthe three previous generations, thirty flowers on the crossed plantswere fertilised with their own pollen. These yielded only five capsules,and their seeds being placed in separate watch-glasses did not seem morenumerous than those from the capsules on the self-fertilised plantsself-fertilised for the fourth time. So that as far as can be judgedfrom so few capsules, the self-fertility of the self-fertilised plantshad not decreased in comparison with that of the plants which had beenintercrossed during the three previous generations. It should, however,be remembered that both lots of plants had been subjected in eachgeneration to almost exactly similar conditions.Seeds from the crossed plants again crossed, and from theself-fertilised again self-fertilised, produced by the plants in Pot 1(Table 6/79), in which the three self-fertilised plants were on anaverage only a little taller than the crossed, were used in thefollowing experiment. They were kept separate from two similar lots ofseeds produced by the two plants in Pot 4 in the same table, in whichthe crossed plant was much taller than its self-fertilised opponent.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FOURTH GENERATION (RAISED FROMTHE PLANTS IN POT 1, TABLE 6/79).Crossed and self-fertilised seeds from plants of the last generation inPot 1 in Table 6/79, were placed on sand, and after germinating, wereplanted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots. The seedlings whenin full flower were measured to the base of the calyx. The remainingseeds were sown crowded on the two sides of Pot 5; and the four tallestplants on each side of this pot were measured in the same manner.TABLE 6/80. Petunia violacea (fourth generation; raised from plants ofthe third generation in Pot 1, table 6/79).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   29 2/8 :  30 2/8.Pot 1  :   36 2/8 :  34 6/8.Pot 1  :   49     :  31 3/8.Pot 2  :   33 3/8 :  31 5/8.Pot 2  :   37 3/8 :  38 2/8.Pot 2  :   56 4/8 :  38 4/8.Pot 3  :   46     :  45 1/8.Pot 3  :   67 2/8 :  45.Pot 3  :   54 3/8 :  23 2/8.Pot 4  :   51 6/8 :  34.Pot 4  :   51 7/8 :   0.Pot 5  :   49 4/8 :  22 3/8.Pot 5  :   46 3/8 :  24 2/8.Pot 5  :   40     :  24 6/8.Pot 5  :   53     :  30.Crowded plants.Total  :  701.88  : 453.50.The fifteen crossed plants average 46.79, and the fourteen (one havingdied) self-fertilised plants 32.39 inches in height; or as 100 to 69. Sothat the crossed plants in this generation had recovered their wontedsuperiority over the self-fertilised plants; though the parents of thelatter in Pot 1, Table 6/79, were a little taller than their crossedopponents.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE FOURTH GENERATION (RAISED FROMTHE PLANTS IN POT 4, TABLE 6/79).Two similar lots of seeds, obtained from the plants in Pot 4 in Table6/79, in which the single crossed plant was at first shorter, butultimately much taller than its self-fertilised opponent, were treatedin every way like their brethren of the same generation in the lastexperiment. We have in Table 6/81 the measurements of the presentplants. Although the crossed plants greatly exceeded in height theself-fertilised; yet in three out of the five pots a self-fertilisedplant flowered before any one of the crossed; in a fourth potsimultaneously; and in a fifth (namely Pot 2) a crossed plant floweredfirst.TABLE 6/81.

Thecrossed parents of these were much taller, relatively to theself-fertilised parents, than in the last case; and apparently theytransmitted some of this superiority to their crossed offspring. It isunfortunate that I did not turn these plants out of doors, so as toobserve their relative fertility, for I compared the pollen from some ofthe crossed and self-fertilised plants in Pot 1, Table 6/81, and therewas a marked difference in its state; that of the crossed plantscontained hardly any bad and empty grains, whilst such abounded in thepollen of the self-fertilised plants.THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK.I procured from a garden in Westerham, whence my plants originally came,a fresh plant differing in no respect from mine except in the colour ofthe flowers, which was a fine purple. But this plant must have beenexposed during at least four generations to very different conditionsfrom those to which my plants had been subjected, as these had beengrown in pots in the greenhouse. Eight flowers on the self-fertilisedplants in Table 6/81, of the last or fourth self-fertilised generation,were fertilised with pollen from this fresh stock; all eight producedcapsules containing together by weight 5.01 grains of seeds. The plantsraised from these seeds may be called the Westerham-crossed.Eight flowers on the crossed plants of the last or fourth generation inTable 6/81 were again crossed with pollen from one of the other crossedplants, and produced five capsules, containing by weight 2.07 grains ofseeds. The plants raised from these seeds may be called theINTERCROSSED; and these form the fifth intercrossed generation.Eight flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the same generation inTable 6/81 were again self-fertilised, and produced seven capsules,containing by weight 2.1 grains of seeds. The SELF-FERTILISED plantsraised from these seeds form the fifth self-fertilised generation. Theselatter plants and the intercrossed are comparable in all respects withthe crossed and self-fertilised plants of the four previous generations.From the foregoing data it is easy to calculate that:Ten Westerham-crossed capsules would have contained 6.26 grains weightof seed.Ten intercrossed capsules would have contained 4.14 grains weight ofseed.Ten self-fertilised capsules would have contained 3.00 grains weight ofseed.We thus get the following ratios:--Seeds from the Westerham-crossed capsules to those from the capsules ofthe fifth self-fertilised generation, in weight as 100 to 48.Seeds from the Westerham-crossed capsules to those from the capsules ofthe fifth intercrossed generation, in weight as 100 to 66.Seeds from the intercrossed capsules to those from the self-fertilisedcapsules, in weight as 100 to 72.So that a cross with pollen from a fresh stock greatly increased theproductiveness of the flowers on plants which had been self-fertilisedfor the four previous generations, in comparison not only with theflowers on the same plants self-fertilised for the fifth time, but withthe flowers on the crossed plants crossed with pollen from another plantof the same old stock for the fifth time.These three lots of seeds were placed on sand, and were planted in anequal state of germination in seven pots, each made tripartite by threesuperficial partitions. Some of the remaining seeds, whether or not in astate of germination, were thickly sown in an eighth pot. The pots werekept in the greenhouse, and the plants trained up sticks. They werefirst measured to the tops of their stems when coming into flower; andthe twenty-two Westerham-crossed plants then averaged 25.51 inches; thetwenty-three intercrossed plants 30.38; and the twenty-threeself-fertilised plants 23.40 inches in height. We thus get the followingratios:--The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to91.The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to119.The intercrossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to 77.These plants were again measured when their growth appeared on a casualinspection to be complete. But in this I was mistaken, for after cuttingthem down, I found that the summits of the stems of theWesterham-crossed plants were still growing vigorously; whilst theintercrossed had almost, and the self-fertilised had quite completedtheir growth. Therefore I do not doubt, if the three lots had been leftto grow for another month, that the ratios would have been somewhatdifferent from those deduced from the measurements in Table 6/82.TABLE 6/82.

We thus get thefollowing ratios:--The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to66.The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to108.The intercrossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to 61.We here see that the Westerham-crossed (the offspring of plantsself-fertilised for four generations and then crossed with a freshstock) have gained greatly in height, since they were first measured,relatively to the plants self-fertilised for five generations. They werethen as 100 to 91, and now as 100 to 66 in height. The intercrossedplants (i.e., those which had been intercrossed for the last fivegenerations) likewise exceed in height the self-fertilised plants, asoccurred in all the previous generations with the exception of theabnormal plants of the third generation. On the other hand, theWesterham-crossed plants are exceeded in height by the intercrossed; andthis is a surprising fact, judging from most of the other strictlyanalogous cases. But as the Westerham-crossed plants were still growingvigorously, while the intercrossed had almost ceased to grow, there canhardly be a doubt that if left to grow for another month they would havebeaten the intercrossed in height. That they were gaining on them isclear, as when measured before they were as 100 to 119, and now as only100 to 108 in height. The Westerham-crossed plants had also leaves of adarker green, and looked altogether more vigorous than the intercrossed;and what is much more important, they produced, as we shall presentlysee, much heavier seed-capsules. So that in fact the offspring from theself-fertilised plants of the fourth generation crossed by a fresh stockwere superior to the intercrossed, as well as to the self-fertilisedplants of the fifth generation--of which latter fact there could not bethe least doubt.These three lots of plants were cut down close to the ground andweighed. The twenty-one Westerham-crossed plants weighed 32 ounces; thetwenty-two intercrossed plants, 34 ounces, and the twenty-oneself-fertilised plants 7 1/4 ounces. The following ratios are calculatedfor an equal number of plants of each kind. But as the self-fertilisedplants were just beginning to wither, their relative weight is hereslightly too small; and as the Westerham-crossed were still growingvigorously, their relative weight with time allowed would no doubt havegreatly increased.The Westerham-crossed plants in weight to the self-fertilised as 100 to22.The Westerham-crossed plants in weight to the intercrossed as 100 to101.The intercrossed plants in weight to the self-fertilised as 100 to 22.3.We here see, judging by weight instead of as before by height, that theWesterham-crossed and the intercrossed have an immense advantage overthe self-fertilised. The Westerham-crossed are inferior to theintercrossed by a mere trifle; but it is almost certain that if they hadbeen allowed to go on growing for another month, the former would havecompletely beaten the latter.As I had an abundance of seeds of the same three lots, from which theforegoing plants had been raised, these were sown in three long paralleland adjoining rows in the open ground, so as to ascertain whether underthese circumstances the results would be nearly the same as before. Latein the autumn (November 13) the ten tallest plants were carefullyselected out of each row, and their heights measured, with the followingresult:--TABLE 6/83. Petunia violacea (plants growing in the open ground).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Westerham-Crossed Plants (from self-fertilised Plants of thefourth generation crossed by a fresh stock).Column 2: intercrossed Plants (Plants of one and the same stockintercrossed for five generations).Column 3: self-fertilised Plants (self-fertilised for five generations).   34 2/8 :   38     :   27 3/8.   36 2/8 :   36 2/8 :   23.   35 2/8 :   39 5/8 :   25.   32 4/8 :   37     :   24 1/8.   37     :   36     :   22 4/8.   36 4/8 :   41 3/8 :   23 3/8.   40 7/8 :   37 2/8 :   21 5/8.   37 2/8 :   40     :   23 4/8.   38 2/8 :   41 2/8 :   21 3/8.   38 5/8 :   36     :   21 2/8. 366.76   :  382.76  :  233.13.The ten Westerham-crossed plants here average 36.67 inches in height;the ten intercrossed plants, 38.27 inches; and the ten self-fertilised,23.31 inches. These three lots of plants were also weighed; theWesterham-crossed plants weighed 28 ounces; the intercrossed plants, 41ounces; and the self-fertilised, 14.75 ounces. We thus get the followingratios:--The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to63.The Westerham-crossed plants in weight to the self-fertilised as 100 to53.The Westerham-crossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to104.The Westerham-crossed plants in weight to the intercrossed as 100 to146.The intercrossed plants in height to the self-fertilised as 100 to 61.The intercrossed plants in weight to the self-fertilised as 100 to 36.Here the relative heights of the three lots are nearly the same (withinthree or four per cent) as with the plants in the pots. In weight thereis a much greater difference: the Westerham-crossed exceed theself-fertilised by much less than they did before; but theself-fertilised plants in the pots had become slightly withered, asbefore stated, and were in consequence unfairly light. TheWesterham-crossed plants are here inferior in weight to the intercrossedplants in a much higher degree than in the pots; and this appeared dueto their being much less branched, owing to their having germinated ingreater numbers and consequently being much crowded. Their leaves wereof a brighter green than those of the intercrossed and self-fertilisedplants.RELATIVE FERTILITY OF THE THREE LOTS OF PLANTS.None of the plants in pots in the greenhouse ever produced a capsule;and this may be attributed in chief part to the exclusion of moths.Therefore the fertility of the three lots could be judged of only bythat of the plants growing out of doors, which from being left uncoveredwere probably cross-fertilised. The plants in the three rows wereexactly of the same age and had been subjected to closely similarconditions, so that any difference in their fertility must be attributedto their different origin; namely, to the one lot being derived fromplants self-fertilised for four generations and then crossed with afresh stock; to the second lot being derived from plants of the same oldstock intercrossed for five generations; and to the third lot beingderived from plants self-fertilised for five generations. All thecapsules, some nearly mature and some only half-grown, were gathered,counted, and weighed from the ten finest plants in each of the threerows, of which the measurements and weights have already been given. Theintercrossed plants, as we have seen, were taller and considerablyheavier than the plants of the other two lots, and they produced agreater number of capsules than did even the Westerham-crossed plants;and this may be attributed to the latter having grown more crowded andbeing in consequence less branched. Therefore the average weight of anequal number of capsules from each lot of plants seems to be the faireststandard of comparison, as their weights will have been determinedchiefly by the number of the included seeds. As the intercrossed plantswere taller and heavier than the plants of the other two lots, it mighthave been expected that they would have produced the finest or heaviestcapsules; but this was very far from being the case.The ten tallest Westerham-crossed plants produced 111 ripe and unripecapsules, weighing 121.2 grains. Therefore 100 of such capsules wouldhave weighed 109.18 grains.The ten tallest intercrossed plants produced 129 capsules, weighing76.45 grains. Therefore 100 of these capsules would have weighed 59.26grains.The ten tallest self-fertilised plants produced only 44 capsules,weighing 22.35 grains. Therefore 100 of these capsules would haveweighed 50.79 grains.From these data we get the following ratios for the fertility of thethree lots, as deduced from the relative weights of an equal number ofcapsules from the finest plants in each lot:--Westerham-crossed plants to self-fertilised plants as 100 to 46.Westerham-crossed plants to intercrossed plants as 100 to 54.Intercrossed plants to self-fertilised plants as 100 to 86.We here see how potent the influence of a cross with pollen from a freshstock has been on the fertility of plants self-fertilised for fourgenerations, in comparison with plants of the old stock when eitherintercrossed or self-fertilised for five generations; the flowers on allthese plants having been left to be freely crossed by insects or tofertilise themselves. The Westerham-crossed plants were also much tallerand heavier plants than the self-fertilised, both in the pots and openground; but they were less tall and heavy than the intercrossed plants.This latter result, however, would almost certainly have been reversed,if the plants had been allowed to grow for another month, as theWesterham-crossed were still growing vigorously, whilst the intercrossedhad almost ceased to grow. This case reminds us of the somewhatanalogous one of Eschscholtzia, in which plants raised from a cross witha fresh stock did not grow higher than the self-fertilised orintercrossed plants, but produced a greater number of seed-capsules,which contained a far larger average number of seeds.COLOUR OF THE FLOWERS ON THE ABOVE THREE LOTS OF PLANTS.The original mother-plant, from which the five successiveself-fertilised generations were raised, bore dingy purple flowers. Atno time was any selection practised, and the plants were subjected ineach generation to extremely uniform conditions. The result was, as insome previous cases, that the flowers on all the self-fertilised plants,both in the pots and open ground, were absolutely uniform in tint; thisbeing a dull, rather peculiar flesh colour. This uniformity was verystriking in the long row of plants growing in the open ground, and thesefirst attracted my attention. I did not notice in which generation theoriginal colour began to change and to become uniform, but I have everyreason to believe that the change was gradual. The flowers on theintercrossed plants were mostly of the same tint, but not nearly souniform as those on the self-fertilised plants, and many of them werepale, approaching almost to white. The flowers on the plants from thecross with the purple-flowered Westerham stock were, as might have beenexpected, much more purple and not nearly so uniform in tint. Theself-fertilised plants were also remarkably uniform in height, as judgedby the eye; the intercrossed less so, whilst the Westerham-crossedplants varied much in height.Nicotiana tabacum.This plant offers a curious case. Out of six trials with crossed andself-fertilised plants, belonging to three successive generations, inone alone did the crossed show any marked superiority in height over theself-fertilised; in four of the trials they were approximately equal;and in one (i.e., in the first generation) the self-fertilised plantswere greatly superior to the crossed. In no case did the capsules fromflowers fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant yield many more,and sometimes they yielded much fewer seeds than the capsules fromself-fertilised flowers. But when the flowers of one variety werecrossed with pollen from a slightly different variety, which had grownunder somewhat different conditions,--that is, by a fresh stock,--theseedlings derived from this cross exceeded in height and weight thosefrom the self-fertilised flowers in an extraordinary degree.Twelve flowers on some plants of the common tobacco, raised frompurchased seeds, were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant of thesame lot, and these produced ten capsules. Twelve flowers on the sameplants were fertilised with their own pollen, and produced elevencapsules. The seeds in the ten crossed capsules weighed 31.7 grains,whilst those in ten of the self-fertilised capsules weighed 47.67grains; or as 100 to 150. The much greater productiveness of theself-fertilised than of the crossed capsules can hardly be attributed tochance, as all the capsules of both lots were very fine and healthyones.The seeds were placed on sand, and several pairs in an equal state ofgermination were planted on the opposite sides of three pots. Theremaining seeds were thickly sown on the two sides of Pot 4, so that theplants in this pot were much crowded. The tallest plant on each side ofeach pot was measured. Whilst the plants were quite young the fourtallest crossed plants averaged 7.87 inches, and the four tallestself-fertilised 14.87 inches in height; or as 100 to 189. The heights atthis age are given in the two left columns of Table 6/84.When in full flower the tallest plants on each side were again measured,see the two right hand columns in Table 6/84. But I should state thatthe pots were not large enough, and the plants never grew to theirproper height. The four tallest crossed plants now averaged 18.5, andthe four tallest self-fertilised plants 32.75 inches in height; or as100 to 178. In all four pots a self-fertilised plant flowered before anyone of the crossed.In Pot 4, in which the plants were extremely crowded, the two lots wereat first equal; and ultimately the tallest crossed plant exceeded by atrifle the tallest self-fertilised plant. This recalled to my mind ananalogous case in the one generation of Petunia, in which theself-fertilised plants were throughout their growth taller than thecrossed in all the pots except in the crowded one. Accordingly anothertrial was made, and some of the same crossed and self-fertilised seedsof tobacco were sown thickly on opposite sides of two additional pots;the plants being left to grow up much crowded. When they were between 13and 14 inches in height there was no difference between the two sides,nor was there any marked difference when the plants had grown as tall asthey could; for in one pot the tallest crossed plant was 26 1/2 inchesin height, and exceeded by 2 inches the tallest self-fertilised plant,whilst in the other pot, the tallest crossed plant was shorter by 3 1/2inches than the tallest self-fertilised plant, which was 22 inches inheight.TABLE 6/84.

When these plants werein flower I neglected to measure them, but record in my notes that allfour self-fertilised plants exceeded in height the four crossed plantsby 2 or 3 inches. We have seen that the flowers on the original orparent-plants which were crossed with pollen from a distinct plantyielded much fewer seeds than those fertilised with their own pollen;and the trial just given, as well as that in Table 6/84, show us clearlythat the plants raised from the crossed seeds were inferior in height tothose from the self-fertilised seeds; but only when not greatly crowded.When crowded and thus subjected to very severe competition, the crossedand self-fertilised plants were nearly equal in height.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION.Twelve flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation growing inthe four large pots just mentioned, were crossed with pollen from acrossed plant growing in one of the other pots; and twelve flowers onthe self-fertilised plants were fertilised with their own pollen. Allthese flowers of both lots produced fine capsules. Ten of the crossedcapsules contained by weight 38.92 grains of seeds, and ten of theself-fertilised capsules 37.74 grains; or as 100 to 97. Some of theseseeds in an equal state of germination were planted in pairs on theopposite sides of five large pots. A good many of the crossed seedsgerminated before the self-fertilised, and were of course rejected. Theplants thus raised were measured when several of them were in fullflower.TABLE 6/85.

But itwould be a very much fairer plan to exclude all the starved plants ofonly 10 inches and under in height; and in this case the nine remainingcrossed plants average 53.84, and the seven remaining self-fertilisedplants 51.78 inches in height, or as 100 to 96; and this difference isso small that the crossed and self-fertilised plants may be consideredas of equal heights.In addition to these plants, three crossed plants were plantedseparately in three large pots, and three self-fertilised plants inthree other large pots, so that they were not exposed to anycompetition; and now the self-fertilised plants exceeded the crossed inheight by a little, for the three crossed averaged 55.91, and the threeself-fertilised 59.16 inches; or as 100 to 106.CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS OF THE THIRD GENERATION.TABLE 6/86.

Four flowers on each plantwere fertilised with their own pollen, and four others on the sameplants were crossed with pollen from one of the crossed plants growingin another pot. This plan differs from that before followed, in whichseedlings from crossed plants again crossed, have been compared withseedlings from self-fertilised plants again self-fertilised. The seedsfrom the crossed and self-fertilised capsules of the above two plantswere placed in separate watch-glasses and compared, but were notweighed; and in both cases those from the crossed capsules seemed to berather less numerous than those from the self-fertilised capsules. Theseseeds were planted in the usual manner, and the heights of the crossedand self-fertilised seedlings, when fully grown, are given in Tables6/86 and 6/87.The seven crossed plants in the first of these two tables average 95.25,and the seven self-fertilised 79.6 inches in height; or as 100 to 83. Inhalf the pots a crossed plant, and in the other half a self-fertilisedplant flowered first.We now come to the seedlings raised from the other parent-plant B.TABLE 6/87. Nicotiana tabacum (third generation). Seedlings from theself-fertilised plant B in pot 3, Table 6/85, of the last or secondgeneration.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: From Self-fertilised Plant, crossed by a Crossed Plant.Column 3: From Self-fertilised Plant again self-fertilised, forming thethird Self-fertilised generation.Pot 1  :   87 2/8 :  72 4/8.Pot 1  :   49     :  14 2/8.Pot 2  :   98 4/8 :  73.Pot 2  :    0     : 110 4/8.Pot 3  :   99     : 106 4/8.Pot 3  :   15 2/8 :  73 6/8.Pot 4  :   97 6/8 :  48 6/8.Pot 5  :   48 6/8 :  81 2/8.Pot 5  :    0     :  61 2/8.Total  :  495.50  : 641.75.The seven crossed plants (for two of them died) here average 70.78inches, and the nine self-fertilised plants 71.3 inches in height; or as100 to barely 101. In four out of these five pots, a self-fertilisedplant flowered before any one of the crossed plants. So that,differently from the last case, the self-fertilised plants are in somerespects slightly superior to the crossed.If we now consider the crossed and self-fertilised plants of the threegenerations, we find an extraordinary diversity in their relativeheights. In the first generation, the crossed plants were inferior tothe self-fertilised as 100 to 178; and the flowers on the originalparent-plants which were crossed with pollen from a distinct plantyielded much fewer seeds than the self-fertilised flowers, in theproportion of 100 to 150. But it is a strange fact that theself-fertilised plants, which were subjected to very severe competitionwith the crossed, had on two occasions no advantage over them. Theinferiority of the crossed plants of this first generation cannot beattributed to the immaturity of the seeds, for I carefully examinedthem; nor to the seeds being diseased or in any way injured in some onecapsule, for the contents of the ten crossed capsules were mingledtogether and a few taken by chance for sowing. In the second generationthe crossed and self-fertilised plants were nearly equal in height. Inthe third generation, crossed and self-fertilised seeds were obtainedfrom two plants of the previous generation, and the seedlings raisedfrom them differed remarkably in constitution; the crossed in the onecase exceeded the self-fertilised in height in the ratio of 100 to 83,and in the other case were almost equal. This difference between the twolots, raised at the same time from two plants growing in the same pot,and treated in every respect alike, as well as the extraordinarysuperiority of the self-fertilised over the crossed plants in the firstgeneration, considered together, make me believe that some individualsof the present species differ to a certain extent from others in theirsexual affinities (to use the term employed by Gartner), like closelyallied species of the same genus. Consequently if two plants which thusdiffer are crossed, the seedlings suffer and are beaten by those fromthe self-fertilised flowers, in which the sexual elements are of thesame nature. It is known that with our domestic animals certainindividuals are sexually incompatible, and will not produce offspring,although fertile with other individuals. (6/3. I have given evidence onthis head in my 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 page 146.) But Kolreuter has recorded acase which bears more closely on our present one, as it shows that inthe genus Nicotiana the varieties differ in their sexual affinities.(6/4. 'Das Geschlecht der Pflanzen, Zweite Fortsetzung' 1764 pages55-60.) He experimented on five varieties of the common tobacco, andproved that they were varieties by showing that they were perfectlyfertile when reciprocally crossed; but one of these varieties, if usedeither as the father or the mother, was more fertile than any of theothers when crossed with a widely distinct species, N. glutinosa. As thedifferent varieties thus differ in their sexual affinities, there isnothing surprising in the individuals of the same variety differing in alike manner to a slight degree.Taking the plants of the three generations altogether, the crossed showno superiority over the self-fertilised, and I can account for this factonly by supposing that with this species, which is perfectlyself-fertile without insect aid, most of the individuals are in the samecondition, as those of the same variety of the common pea and of a fewother exotic plants, which have been self-fertilised for manygenerations. In such cases a cross between two individuals does no good;nor does it in any case, unless the individuals differ in generalconstitution, either from so-called spontaneous variation, or from theirprogenitors having been subjected to different conditions. I believethat this is the true explanation in the present instance, because, aswe shall immediately see, the offspring of plants, which did not profitat all by being crossed with a plant of the same stock, profited to anextraordinary degree by a cross with a slightly different sub-variety.THE EFFECTS OF A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK.I procured some seed of N. tabacum from Kew and raised some plants,which formed a slightly different sub-variety from my former plants; asthe flowers were a shade pinker, the leaves a little more pointed, andthe plants not quite so tall. Therefore the advantage in height whichthe seedlings gained by this cross cannot be attributed to directinheritance. Two of the plants of the third self-fertilised generation,growing in Pots 2 and 5 in Table 6/87, which exceeded in height theircrossed opponents (as did their parents in a still higher degree) werefertilised with pollen from the Kew plants, that is, by a fresh stock.The seedlings thus raised may be called the Kew-crossed. Some otherflowers on the same two plants were fertilised with their own pollen,and the seedlings thus raised from the fourth self-fertilisedgeneration. The crossed capsules produced by the plant in Pot 2, Table6/87, were plainly less fine than the self-fertilised capsules on thesame plant. In Pot 5 the one finest capsule was also a self-fertilisedone; but the seeds produced by the two crossed capsules togetherexceeded in number those produced by the two self-fertilised capsules onthe same plant. Therefore as far as the flowers on the parent-plants areconcerned, a cross with pollen from a fresh stock did little or no good;and I did not expect that the offspring would have received any benefit,but in this I was completely mistaken.The crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the two plants were placed onbare sand, and very many of the crossed seeds of both sets germinatedbefore the self-fertilised seeds, and protruded their radicles at aquicker rate. Hence many of the crossed seeds had to be rejected, beforepairs in an equal state of germination were obtained for planting on theopposite sides of sixteen large pots. The two series of seedlings raisedfrom the parent-plants in the two Pots 2 and 5 were kept separate, andwhen fully grown were measured to the tips of their highest leaves, asshown in Table 6/88. But as there was no uniform difference in heightbetween the crossed and self-fertilised seedlings raised from the twoplants, their heights have been added together in calculating theaverages. I should state that by the accidental fall of a large bush inthe greenhouse, several plants in both the series were much injured.These were at once measured together with their opponents and afterwardsthrown away. The others were left to grow to their full height, and weremeasured when in flower. This accident accounts for the small height ofsome of the pairs; but as all the pairs, whether only partly or fullygrown, were measured at the same time, the measurements are fair.The average height of the twenty-six crossed plants in the sixteen potsof the two series is 63.29, and that of the twenty-six self-fertilisedplants is 41.67 inches; or as 100 to 66. The superiority of the crossedplants was shown in another way, for in every one of the sixteen pots acrossed plant flowered before a self-fertilised one, with the exceptionof Pot 6 of the second series, in which the plants on the two sidesflowered simultaneously.TABLE 6/88.

But their heights weremuch less than in the former trials, owing to their extremely crowdedcondition. Even whilst quite young, the crossed seedlings manifestly hadmuch broader and finer leaves than the self-fertilised seedlings.TABLE 6/89. Nicotiana tabacum.

The plants on both sides, whenfully grown, some time after they had been measured, were cut down closeto the ground and weighed. The twelve crossed plants weighed 21.25ounces; and the twelve self-fertilised plants only 7.83 ounces; or inweight as 100 to 37.The rest of the crossed and self-fertilised seeds from the twoparent-plants (the same as in the last experiment) was sown on the 1stof July in four long parallel and separate rows in good soil in the openground; so that the seedlings were not subjected to any mutualcompetition. The summer was wet and unfavourable for their growth.Whilst the seedlings were very small the two crossed rows had a clearadvantage over the two self-fertilised rows. When fully grown the twentytallest crossed plants and the twenty tallest self-fertilised plantswere selected and measured on the 11th of November to the extremities oftheir leaves, as shown in Table 6/90. Of the twenty crossed plants,twelve had flowered; whilst of the twenty self-fertilised plants onealone had flowered.TABLE 6/90. Nicotiana tabacum.

Theseplants after being measured were cut down close to the ground, and thetwenty crossed plants weighed 195.75 ounces, and the twentyself-fertilised plants 123.25 ounces; or as 100 to 63.In Tables 6/88, 6/89 and 6/90, we have the measurements of fifty-sixplants derived from two plants of the third self-fertilised generationcrossed with pollen from a fresh stock, and of fifty-six plants of thefourth self-fertilised generation derived from the same two plants.These crossed and self-fertilised plants were treated in three differentways, having been put, firstly, into moderately close competition withone another in pots; secondly, having been subjected to unfavourableconditions and to very severe competition from being greatly crowded intwo large pots; and thirdly, having been sown separately in open andgood ground, so as not to suffer from any mutual competition. In allthese cases the crossed plants in each lot were greatly superior to theself-fertilised. This was shown in several ways,--by the earliergermination of the crossed seeds, by the more rapid growth of theseedlings whilst quite young, by the earlier flowering of the matureplants, as well as by the greater height which they ultimately attained.The superiority of the crossed plants was shown still more plainly whenthe two lots were weighed; the weight of the crossed plants to that ofthe self-fertilised in the two crowded pots being as 100 to 37. Betterevidence could hardly be desired of the immense advantage derived from across with a fresh stock.26. PRIMULACEAE.--Cyclamen persicum. (6/5. Cyclamen repandum accordingto Lecoq 'Geographie Botanique de l'Europe' tome 8 1858 page 150, isproterandrous, and this I believe to be the case with Cyclamenpersicum.)Ten flowers crossed with pollen from plants known to be distinctseedlings, yielded nine capsules, containing on an average 34.2 seeds,with a maximum of seventy-seven in one. Ten flowers self-fertilisedyielded eight capsules, containing on an average only 13.1 seeds, with amaximum of twenty-five in one. This gives a ratio of 100 to 38 for theaverage number of seeds per capsule for the crossed and self-fertilisedflowers. The flowers hang downwards, and as the stigmas stand closebeneath the anthers, it might have been expected that pollen would havefallen on them, and that they would have been spontaneouslyself-fertilised; but these covered-up plants did not produce a singlecapsule. On some other occasions uncovered plants in the same greenhouseproduced plenty of capsules, and I suppose that the flowers had beenvisited by bees, which could hardly fail to carry pollen from plant toplant.The seeds obtained in the manner just described were placed on sand, andafter germinating were planted in pairs,--three crossed and threeself-fertilised plants on the opposite sides of four pots. When theleaves were 2 or 3 inches in length, including the foot-stalks, theseedlings on both sides were equal. In the course of a month or two thecrossed plants began to show a slight superiority over theself-fertilised, which steadily increased; and the crossed flowered inall four pots some weeks before, and much more profusely than theself-fertilised. The two tallest flower-stems on the crossed plants ineach pot were now measured, and the average height of the eight stemswas 9.49 inches. After a considerable interval of time theself-fertilised plants flowered, and several of their flower-stems (butI forgot to record how many) were roughly measured, and their averageheight was a little under 7.5 inches; so that the flower-stems on thecrossed plants to those on the self-fertilised were at least as 100 to79. The reason why I did not make more careful measurements of theself-fertilised plants was, that they looked such poor specimens that Idetermined to there them re-potted in larger pots and in the followingyear to measure them carefully; but we shall see that this was partlyfrustrated by so few flower-stems being then produced.These plants were left uncovered in the greenhouse; and the twelvecrossed plants produced forty capsules, whilst the twelveself-fertilised plants produced only five; or as 100 to 12. But thisdifference does not give a just idea of the relative fertility of thetwo lots. I counted the seeds in one of the finest capsules on thecrossed plants, and it contained seventy-three; whilst the finest of thefive capsules produced by the self-fertilised plants contained onlythirty-five good seeds. In the other four capsules most of the seedswere barely half as large as those in the crossed capsules.TABLE 6/91.

The three tallest flower-stems onthe crossed plants in each of the pots were measured, as shown in Table6/91. In Pots 1 and 2 the self-fertilised plants did not produce asingle flower-stem; in Pot 4 only one; and in Pot 3 six, of which thethree tallest were measured.The average height of the twelve flower-stems on the crossed plants is9.99, and that of the four flower-stems on the self-fertilised plants7.37 inches; or as 100 to 74. The self-fertilised plants were miserablespecimens, whilst the crossed ones looked very vigorous.ANAGALLIS.Anagallis collina, var. grandiflora (pale red and blue-floweredsub-varieties).Firstly, twenty-five flowers on some plants of the red variety werecrossed with pollen from a distinct plant of the same variety, andproduced ten capsules; thirty-one flowers were fertilised with their ownpollen, and produced eighteen capsules. These plants, which were grownin pots in the greenhouse, were evidently in a very sterile condition,and the seeds in both sets of capsules, especially in theself-fertilised, although numerous, were of so poor a quality that itwas very difficult to determine which were good and which bad. But asfar as I could judge, the crossed capsules contained on an average 6.3good seeds, with a maximum in one of thirteen; whilst theself-fertilised contained 6.05 such seeds, with a maximum in one offourteen.Secondly, eleven flowers on the red variety were castrated whilst youngand fertilised with pollen from the blue variety, and this crossevidently much increased their fertility; for the eleven flowers yieldedseven capsules, which contained on an average twice as many good seedsas before, namely, 12.7; with a maximum in two of the capsules ofseventeen seeds. Therefore these crossed capsules yielded seeds comparedwith those in the foregoing self-fertilised capsules, as 100 to 48.These seeds were also conspicuously larger than those from the crossbetween two individuals of the same red variety, and germinated muchmore freely. The flowers on most of the plants produced by the crossbetween the two-coloured varieties (of which several were raised), tookafter their mother, and were red-coloured. But on two of the plants theflowers were plainly stained with blue, and to such a degree in one caseas to be almost intermediate in tint.The crossed seeds of the two foregoing kinds and the self-fertilisedwere sown on the opposite sides of two large pots, and the seedlingswere measured when fully grown, as shown in Tables 6/92a and 6/92b.TABLE 6/92a.

So that the cross between the two varieties is here seen to be themost advantageous. The average height of all six crossed plants in thetwo lots taken together is 48.20, and that of the six self-fertilisedplants 33.25; or as 100 to 69.These six crossed plants produced spontaneously twenty-six capsules,whilst the six self-fertilised plants produced only two, or as 100 to 8.There is therefore the same extraordinary difference in fertilitybetween the crossed and self-fertilised plants as in the last genus,Cyclamen, which belongs to the same family of the Primulaceae.Primula veris. British flora. (var. officinalis, Linn.).THE COWSLIP.Most of the species in this genus are heterostyled or dimorphic; thatis, they present two forms,--one long-styled with short stamens, and theother short-styled with long stamens. (6/6. See my paper 'On the TwoForms or Dimorphic Condition in the Species of Primula' in 'Journal ofthe Proceedings of the Linnean Society' volume 6 1862 page 77. A secondpaper, to which I presently refer 'On the Hybrid-like Nature of theOffspring from the Illegitimate Unions of Dimorphic and TrimorphicPlants' was published in volume 10 1867 page 393 of the same journal.)For complete fertilisation it is necessary that pollen from the one formshould be applied to the stigma of the other form; and this is effectedunder nature by insects. Such unions, and the seedlings raised fromthem, I have called legitimate. If one form is fertilised with pollenfrom the same form, the full complement of seed is not produced; and inthe case of some heterostyled genera no seed at all is produced. Suchunions, and the seedlings raised from them, I have called illegitimate.These seedlings are often dwarfed and more or less sterile, likehybrids. I possessed some long-styled plants of Primula veris, whichduring four successive generations had been produced from illegitimateunions between long-styled plants; they were, moreover, in some degreeinter-related, and had been subjected all the time to similar conditionsin pots in the greenhouse. As long as they were cultivated in thismanner, they grew well and were healthy and fertile. Their fertilityeven increased in the later generations, as if they were becominghabituated to illegitimate fertilisation. Plants of the firstillegitimate generation when taken from the greenhouse and planted inmoderately good soil out of doors grew well and were healthy; but whenthose of the two last illegitimate generations were thus treated theybecame excessively sterile and dwarfed, and remained so during thefollowing year, by which time they ought to have become accustomed togrowing out of doors, so that they must have possessed a weakconstitution.Under these circumstances, it seemed advisable to ascertain what wouldbe the effect of legitimately crossing long-styled plants of the fourthillegitimate generation with pollen taken from non-related short-styledplants, growing under different conditions. Accordingly several flowerson plants of the fourth illegitimate generation (i.e.,great-great-grandchildren of plants which had been legitimatelyfertilised), growing vigorously in pots in the greenhouse, werelegitimately fertilised with pollen from an almost wild short-styledcowslip, and these flowers yielded some fine capsules. Thirty otherflowers on the same illegitimate plants were fertilised with their ownpollen, and these yielded seventeen capsules, containing on an averagethirty-two seeds. This is a high degree of fertility; higher, I believe,than that which generally obtains with illegitimately fertilisedlong-styled plants growing out of doors, and higher than that of theprevious illegitimate generations, although their flowers werefertilised with pollen taken from a distinct plant of the same form.These two lots of seeds were sown (for they will not germinate well whenplaced on bare sand) on the opposite sides of four pots, and theseedlings were thinned, so that an equal number were left on the twosides. For some time there was no marked difference in height betweenthe two lots; and in Pot 3, Table 6/93, the self-fertilised plants wererather the tallest. But by the time that they had thrown up youngflower-stems, the legitimately crossed plants revealed much the finest,and had greener and larger leaves. The breadth of the largest leaf oneach plant was measured, and those on the crossed plants were on anaverage a quarter of an inch (exactly .28 of an inch) broader than thoseon the self-fertilised plants. The plants, from being too much crowded,produced poor and short flower-stems. The two finest on each side weremeasured; the eight on the legitimately crossed plants averaged 4.08,and the eight on the illegitimately self-fertilised plants averaged 2.93inches in height; or as 100 to 72.These plants after they had flowered were turned out of their pots, andplanted in fairly good soil in the open ground. In the following year(1870), when in full flower, the two tallest flower-stems on each sidewere again measured, as shown in Table 6/93, which likewise gives thenumber of flower-stems produced on both sides of all the pots.TABLE 6/93.

We see,also, that the crossed plants bore sixty-two flower-stems; that is,above four times as many as those (namely fifteen) borne by theself-fertilised plants. The flowers were left exposed to the visits ofinsects, and as many plants of both forms grew close by, they must havebeen legitimately and naturally fertilised. Under these circumstancesthe crossed plants produced 324 capsules, whilst the self-fertilisedproduced only 16; and these were all produced by a single plant in Pot2, which was much finer than any other self-fertilised plant. Judging bythe number of capsules produced, the fertility of an equal number ofcrossed and self-fertilised plants was as 100 to 5.In the succeeding year (1871) I did not count all the flower-stems onthese plants, but only those which produced capsules containing goodseeds. The season was unfavourable, and the crossed plants produced onlyforty such flower-stems, bearing 168 good capsules, whilst theself-fertilised plants produced only two such flower-stems, bearing only6 capsules, half of which were very poor ones. So that the fertility ofthe two lots, judging by the number of capsules, was as 100 to 3.5.In considering the great difference in height and the wonderfuldifference in fertility between the two sets of plants, we should bearin mind that this is the result of two distinct agencies. Theself-fertilised plants were the product of illegitimate fertilisationduring five successive generations, in all of which, excepting the last,the plants had been fertilised with pollen taken from a distinctindividual belonging to the same form, but which was more or lessclosely related. The plants had also been subjected in each generationto closely similar conditions. This treatment alone, as I know fromother observations, would have greatly reduced the size and fertility ofthe offspring. On the other hand, the crossed plants were the offspringof long-styled plants of the fourth illegitimate generation legitimatelycrossed with pollen from a short-styled plant, which, as well as itsprogenitors, had been exposed to very different conditions; and thislatter circumstance alone would have given great vigour to theoffspring, as we may infer from the several analogous cases alreadygiven. How much proportional weight ought to be attributed to these twoagencies,--the one tending to injure the self-fertilised offspring, andthe other to benefit the crossed offspring,--cannot be determined. Butwe shall immediately see that the greater part of the benefit, as far asincreased fertility is concerned, must be attributed to the cross havingbeen made with a fresh stock.Primula veris.EQUAL-STYLED AND RED-FLOWERED VAR.I have described in my paper 'On the Illegitimate Unions of Dimorphicand Trimorphic Plants' this remarkable variety, which was sent to mefrom Edinburgh by Mr. J. Scott. It possessed a pistil proper to thelong-styled form, and stamens proper to the short-styled form; so thatit had lost the heterostyled or dimorphic character common to most ofthe species of the genus, and may be compared with an hermaphrodite formof a bisexual animal. Consequently the pollen and stigma of the sameflower are adapted for complete mutual fertilisation, instead of itsbeing necessary that pollen should be brought from one form to another,as in the common cowslip. From the stigma and anthers standing nearly onthe same level, the flowers are perfectly self-fertile when insects areexcluded. Owing to the fortunate existence of this variety, it ispossible to fertilise its flowers in a legitimate manner with their ownpollen, and to cross other flowers in a legitimate manner with pollenfrom another variety or fresh stock. Thus the offspring from both unionscan be compared quite fairly, free from any doubt from the injuriouseffects of an illegitimate union.The plants on which I experimented had been raised during two successivegenerations from spontaneously self-fertilised seeds produced by plantsunder a net; and as the variety is highly self-fertile, its progenitorsin Edinburgh may have been self-fertilised during some previousgenerations. Several flowers on two of my plants were legitimatelycrossed with pollen from a short-styled common cowslip growing almostwild in my orchard; so that the cross was between plants which had beensubjected to considerably different conditions. Several other flowers onthe same two plants were allowed to fertilise themselves under a net;and this union, as already explained, is a legitimate one.The crossed and self-fertilised seeds thus obtained were sown thickly onthe opposite sides of three pots, and the seedlings thinned, so that anequal number were left on the two sides. The seedlings during the firstyear were nearly equal in height, excepting in Pot 3, Table 6/94, inwhich the self-fertilised plants had a decided advantage. In the autumnthe plants were bedded out, in their pots; owing to this circumstance,and to many plants growing in each pot, they did not flourish, and nonewere very productive in seeds. But the conditions were perfectly equaland fair for both sides. In the following spring I record in my notesthat in two of the pots the crossed plants are "incomparably the finestin general appearance," and in all three pots they flowered before theself-fertilised. When in full flower the tallest flower-stem on eachside of each pot was measured, and the number of the flower-stems onboth sides counted, as shown in Table 6/94. The plants were leftuncovered, and as other plants were growing close by, the flowers nodoubt were crossed by insects. When the capsules were ripe they weregathered and counted, and the result is likewise shown in Table 6/94.TABLE 6/94. Primula veris (equal-styled, red-flowered variety).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Height of tallest flower-stem: crossed Plants.Column 3: Number of Flower-stems: crossed Plants.Column 4: Number of good capsules: crossed Plants.Column 5: Height of tallest flower-stem: self-fertilised Plants.Column 6: Number of Flower-stems: self-fertilised Plants.Column 7: Number of good capsules: self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  : 10     : 14     : 163     :  6 4/8 :  6     :  6.Pot 2  :  8 4/8 : 12     :   *     :  5     :  2     :  0.                          *Several, not counted.Pot 3  :  7 4/8 :  7     :  43     : 10 4/8 :  5     : 26.Totals : 26.0   : 33     : 206     : 22.0   : 13     : 32.The average height of the three tallest flower-stems on the crossedplants is 8.66 inches, and that of the three on the self-fertilisedplants 7.33 inches; or as 100 to 85.All the crossed plants together produced thirty-three flower-stems,whilst the self-fertilised bore only thirteen. The number of thecapsules were counted only on the plants in Pots 1 and 3, for theself-fertilised plants in Pot 2 produced none; therefore those on thecrossed plants on the opposite side were not counted. Capsules notcontaining any good seeds were rejected. The crossed plants in the abovetwo pots produced 206, and the self-fertilised in the same pots only 32capsules; or as 100 to 15. Judging from the previous generations, theextreme unproductiveness of the self-fertilised plants in thisexperiment was wholly due to their having been subjected to unfavourableconditions, and to severe competition with the crossed plants; for hadthey grown separately in good soil, it is almost certain that they wouldhave produced a large number of capsules. The seeds were counted intwenty capsules from the crossed plants, and they averaged 24.75; whilstin twenty capsules from the self-fertilised plants the average was17.65; or as 100 to 71. Moreover, the seeds from the self-fertilisedplants were not nearly so fine as those from the crossed plants. If weconsider together the number of capsules produced and the average numberof contained seeds, the fertility of the crossed plants to theself-fertilised plants was as 100 to 11. We thus see what a greateffect, as far as fertility is concerned, was produced by a crossbetween the two varieties, which had been long exposed to differentconditions, in comparison with self-fertilisation; the fertilisationhaving been in both cases of the legitimate order.Primula sinensis.As the Chinese primrose is a heterostyled or dimorphic plant, like thecommon cowslip, it might have been expected that the flowers of bothforms when illegitimately fertilised with their own pollen or with thatfrom flowers on another plant of the same form, would have yielded lessseed than the legitimately crossed flowers; and that the seedlingsraised from illegitimately self-fertilised seeds would have beensomewhat dwarfed and less fertile, in comparison with the seedlings fromlegitimately crossed seeds. This holds good in relation to the fertilityof the flowers; but to my surprise there was no difference in growthbetween the offspring from a legitimate union between two distinctplants, and from an illegitimate union whether between the flowers onthe same plant, or between distinct plants of the same form. But I haveshown, in the paper before referred to, that in England this plant is inan abnormal condition, such as, judging from analogous cases, would tendto render a cross between two individuals of no benefit to theoffspring. Our plants have been commonly raised from self-fertilisedseeds; and the seedlings have generally been subjected to nearly uniformconditions in pots in greenhouses. Moreover, many of the plants are nowvarying and changing their character, so as to become in a greater orless degree equal-styled, and in consequence highly self-fertile. Fromthe analogy of Primula veris there can hardly be a doubt that if a plantof Primula sinensis could have been procured direct from China, and ifit had been crossed with one of our English varieties, the offspringwould have shown wonderful superiority in height and fertility (thoughprobably not in the beauty of their flowers) over our ordinary plants.My first experiment consisted in fertilising many flowers on long-styledand short-styled plants with their own pollen, and other flowers on thesame plants with pollen taken from distinct plants belonging to the sameform; so that all the unions were illegitimate. There was no uniform andmarked difference in the number of seeds obtained from these two modesof self-fertilisation, both of which were illegitimate. The two lots ofseeds from both forms were sown thickly on opposite sides of four pots,and numerous plants thus raised. But there was no difference in theirgrowth, excepting in one pot, in which the offspring from theillegitimate union of two long-styled plants exceeded in a decidedmanner in height the offspring of flowers on the same plants fertilisedwith their own pollen. But in all four pots the plants raised from theunion of distinct plants belonging to the same form, flowered before theoffspring from the self-fertilised flowers.Some long-styled and short-styled plants were now raised from purchasedseeds, and flowers on both forms were legitimately crossed with pollenfrom a distinct plant; and other flowers on both forms wereillegitimately fertilised with pollen from the flowers on the sameplant. The seeds were sown on opposite sides of Pots 1 to 4 in Table6/95; a single plant being left on each side. Several flowers on theillegitimate long-styled and short-styled plants described in the lastparagraph, were also legitimately and illegitimately fertilised in themanner just described, and their seeds were sown in Pots 5 to 8 in thesame table. As the two sets of seedlings did not differ in any essentialmanner, their measurements are given in a single table. I should addthat the legitimate unions in both cases yielded, as might have beenexpected, many more seeds than the illegitimate unions. The seedlingswhilst half-grown presented no difference in height on the two sides ofthe several pots. When fully grown they were measured to the tips oftheir longest leaves, and the result is given in Table 6/95.TABLE 6/95. Primula sinensis.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Plants from legitimately Crossed seeds.Column 3: Plants from illegitimately Self-fertilised seeds.Pot 1  :    8 2/8 :   8.From short-styled mother.Pot 2  :    7 4/8 :   8 5/8.From short-styled mother.Pot 3  :    9 5/8 :   9 3/8.From long-styled mother.Pot 4  :    8 4/8 :   8 2/8.From long-styled mother.Pot 5  :    9 3/8 :   9.From illegitimate short-styled mother.Pot 6  :    9 7/8 :   9 4/8.From illegitimate short-styled mother.Pot 7  :    8 4/8 :   9 4/8.From illegitimate long-styled mother.Pot 8  :   10 4/8 :  10.From illegitimate long-styled mother.Total  :   72.13  :  72.25.In six out of the eight pots the legitimately crossed plants exceeded inheight by a trifle the illegitimately self-fertilised plants; but thelatter exceeded the former in two of the pots in a more strongly markedmanner. The average height of the eight legitimately crossed plants is9.01, and that of the eight illegitimately self-fertilised 9.03 inches,or as 100 to 100.2. The plants on the opposite sides produced, as far ascould be judged by the eye, an equal number of flowers. I did not countthe capsules or the seeds produced by them; but undoubtedly, judgingfrom many previous observations, the plants derived from thelegitimately crossed seeds would have been considerably more fertilethan those from the illegitimately self-fertilised seeds. The crossedplants, as in the previous case, flowered before the self-fertilisedplants in all the pots except in Pot 2, in which the two sides floweredsimultaneously; and this early flowering may, perhaps, be considered asan advantage.27. POLYGONEAE.--Fagopyrum esculentum.This plant was discovered by Hildebrand to be heterostyled, that is, topresent, like the species of Primula, a long-styled and a short-styledform, which are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation. Therefore thefollowing comparison of the growth of the crossed and self-fertilisedseedlings is not fair, for we do not know whether the difference intheir heights may not be wholly due to the illegitimate fertilisation ofthe self-fertilised flowers.I obtained seeds by legitimately crossing flowers on long-styled andshort-styled plants, and by fertilising other flowers on both forms withpollen from the same plant. Rather more seeds were obtained by theformer than by the latter process; and the legitimately crossed seedswere heavier than an equal number of the illegitimately self-fertilisedseeds, in the ratio of 100 to 82. Crossed and self-fertilised seeds fromthe short-styled parents, after germinating on sand, were planted inpairs on the opposite sides of a large pot; and two similar lots ofseeds from long-styled parents were planted in a like manner on theopposite sides of two other pots. In all three pots the legitimatelycrossed seedlings, when a few inches in height, were taller than theself-fertilised; and in all three pots they flowered before them by oneor two days. When fully grown they were all cut down close to theground, and as I was pressed for time, they were placed in a long row,the cut end of one plant touching the tip of another, and the totallength of the legitimately crossed plants was 47 feet 7 inches, and ofthe illegitimately self-fertilised plants 32 feet 8 inches. Thereforethe average height of the fifteen crossed plants in all three pots was38.06 inches, and that of the fifteen self-fertilised plants 26.13inches; or as 100 to 69.28. CHENOPODIACEAE.--Beta vulgaris.A single plant, no others growing in the same garden, was left tofertilise itself, and the self-fertilised seeds were collected. Seedswere also collected from a plant growing in the midst of a large bed inanother garden; and as the incoherent pollen is abundant, the seeds ofthis plant will almost certainly have been the product of a crossedbetween distinct plants by means of the wind. Some of the two lots ofseeds were sown on the opposite sides of two very large pots; and theyoung seedlings were thinned, so that an equal but considerable numberwas left on the two sides. These plants were thus subjected to verysevere competition, as well as to poor conditions. The remaining seedswere sown out of doors in good soil in two long and not closelyadjoining rows, so that these seedlings were placed under favourableconditions, and were not subjected to any mutual competition. Theself-fertilised seeds in the open ground came up very badly; and onremoving the soil in two or three places, it was found that many hadsprouted under ground and had then died. No such case had been observedbefore. Owing to the large number of seedlings which thus perished, thesurviving self-fertilised plants grew thinly in the row, and thus had anadvantage over the crossed plants, which grew very thickly in the otherrow. The young plants in the two rows were protected by a little strawduring the winter, and those in the two large pots were placed in thegreenhouse.There was no difference between the two lots in the pots until theensuing spring, when they had grown a little, and then some of thecrossed plants were finer and taller than any of the self-fertilised.When in full flower their stems were measured, and the measurements aregiven in Table 6/96.TABLE 6/96. Beta vulgaris.Heights of flower stems measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   34 6/8 :  36.Pot 1  :   30     :  20 1/8.Pot 1  :   33 6/8 :  32 2/8.Pot 1  :   34 4/8 :  32.Pot 2  :   42 3/8 :  42 1/8.Pot 2  :   33 1/8 :  26 4/8.Pot 2  :   31 2/8 :  29 2/8.Pot 2  :   33     :  20 2/8.Total  :  272.75  : 238.50.The average height of the eight crossed plants is here 34.09, and thatof the eight self-fertilised plants 29.81; or as 100 to 87.With respect to the plants in the open ground, each long row was dividedinto half, so as to diminish the chance of any accidental advantage inone part of either row; and the four tallest plants in the two halves ofthe two rows were carefully selected and measured. The eight tallestcrossed plants averaged 30.92, and the eight tallest self-fertilised30.7 inches in height, or as 100 to 99; so that they were practicallyequal. But we should bear in mind that the trial was not quite fair, asthe self-fertilised plants had a great advantage over the crossed inbeing much less crowded in their own row, owing to the large number ofseeds which had perished under ground after sprouting. Nor were the lotsin the two rows subjected to any mutual competition.29. CANNACEAE.--Canna warscewiczi.In most or all the species belonging to this genus, the pollen is shedbefore the flower expands, and adheres in a mass to the foliaceouspistil close beneath the stigmatic surface. As the edge of this massgenerally touches the edge of the stigma, and as it was ascertained bytrials purposely made that a very few pollen-grains suffice forfertilisation, the present species and probably all the others of thegenus are highly self-fertile. Exceptions occasionally occur in which,from the stamen being slightly shorter than usual, the pollen isdeposited a little beneath the stigmatic surface, and such flowers dropoff unimpregnated unless they are artificially fertilised. Sometimes,though rarely, the stamen is a little longer than usual, and then thewhole stigmatic surface gets thickly covered with pollen. As some pollenis generally deposited in contact with the edge of the stigma, certainauthors have concluded that the flowers are invariably self-fertilised.This is an extraordinary conclusion, for it implies that a great amountof pollen is produced for no purpose. On this view, also, the large sizeof the stigmatic surface is an unintelligible feature in the structureof the flower, as well as the relative position of all the parts, whichis such that when insects visit the flowers to suck the copious nectar,they cannot fail to carry pollen from one flower to another. (6/7.Delpino has described 'Bot. Zeitung' 1867 page 277 and 'ScientificOpinion' 1870 page 135, the structure of the flowers in this genus, buthe was mistaken in thinking that self-fertilisation is impossible, atleast in the case of the present species. Dr. Dickie and ProfessorFaivre state that the flowers are fertilised in the bud, and thatself-fertilisation is inevitable. I presume that they were misled by thepollen being deposited at a very early period on the pistil: see'Journal of Linnean Society Botany' volume 10 page 55 and 'Variabilit�des Esp�ces' 1868 page 158.)According to Delpino, bees eagerly visit the flowers in North Italy, butI have never seen any insect visiting the flowers of the present speciesin my hothouse, although many plants grew there during several years.Nevertheless these plants produced plenty of seed, as they likewise didwhen covered by a net; they are therefore fully capable ofself-fertilisation, and have probably been self-fertilised in thiscountry for many generations. As they are cultivated in pots, and arenot exposed to competition with surrounding plants, they have also beensubjected for a considerable time to somewhat uniform conditions. This,therefore, is a case exactly parallel with that of the common pea, inwhich we have no right to expect much or any good from intercrossingplants thus descended and thus treated; and no good did follow,excepting that the cross-fertilised flowers yielded rather more seedsthan the self-fertilised. This species was one of the earlier ones onwhich I experimented, and as I had not then raised any self-fertilisedplants for several successive generations under uniform conditions, Idid not know or even suspect that such treatment would interfere withthe advantages to be gained from a cross. I was therefore much surprisedat the crossed plants not growing more vigorously than theself-fertilised, and a large number of plants were raised,notwithstanding that the present species is an extremely troublesome oneto experiment on. The seeds, even those which have been long soaked inwater, will not germinate well on bare sand; and those that were sown inpots (which plan I was forced to follow) germinated at very unequalintervals of time; so that it was difficult to get pairs of the sameexact age, and many seedlings had to be pulled up and thrown away. Myexperiments were continued during three successive generations; and ineach generation the self-fertilised plants were again self-fertilised,their early progenitors in this country having probably beenself-fertilised for many previous generations. In each generation, also,the crossed plants were fertilised with pollen from another crossedplant.Of the flowers which were crossed in the three generations, takentogether, a rather larger proportion yielded capsules than did thosewhich were self-fertilised. The seeds were counted in forty-sevencapsules from the crossed flowers, and they contained on an average 9.95seeds; whereas forty-eight capsules from the self-fertilised flowerscontained on an average 8.45 seeds; or as 100 to 85. The seeds from thecrossed flowers were not heavier, on the contrary a little lighter, thanthose from the self-fertilised flowers, as was thrice ascertained. Onone occasion I weighed 200 of the crossed and 106 of the self-fertilisedseeds, and the relative weight of an equal number was as 100 for thecrossed to 101.5 for the self-fertilised. With other plants, when theseeds from the self-fertilised flowers were heavier than those from thecrossed flowers, this appeared to be due generally to fewer having beenproduced by the self-fertilised flowers, and to their having been inconsequence better nourished. But in the present instance the seeds fromthe crossed capsules were separated into two lots,--namely, those fromthe capsules containing over fourteen seeds, and those from the capsulescontaining under fourteen seeds, and the seeds from the more productivecapsules were the heavier of the two; so that the above explanation herefails.As pollen is deposited at a very early age on the pistil, generally incontact with the stigma, some flowers whilst still in bud were castratedfor my first experiment, and were afterwards fertilised with pollen froma distinct plant. Other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen.From the seeds thus obtained, I succeeded in rearing only three pairs ofplants of equal age. The three crossed plants averaged 32.79 inches, andthe three self-fertilised 32.08 inches in height; so that they werenearly equal, the crossed having a slight advantage. As the same resultfollowed in all three generations, it would be superfluous to give theheights of all the plants, and I will give only the averages.In order to raise crossed and self-fertilised plants of the secondgeneration, some flowers on the above crossed plants were crossed withintwenty-four hours after they had expanded with pollen from a distinctplant; and this interval would probably not be too great to allow ofcross-fertilisation being effectual. Some flowers on the self-fertilisedplants of the last generation were also self-fertilised. From these twolots of seeds, ten crossed and twelve self-fertilised plants of equalages were raised; and these were measured when fully grown. The crossedaveraged 36.98, and the self-fertilised averaged 37.42 inches in height;so that here again the two lots were nearly equal; but theself-fertilised had a slight advantage.In order to raise plants of the third generation, a better plan wasfollowed, and flowers on the crossed plants of the second generationwere selected in which the stamens were too short to reach the stigmas,so that they could not possibly have been self-fertilised. These flowerswere crossed with pollen from a distinct plant. Flowers on theself-fertilised plants of the second generation were againself-fertilised. From the two lots of seeds thus obtained, twenty-onecrossed and nineteen self-fertilised plants of equal age, and formingthe third generation, were raised in fourteen large pots. They weremeasured when fully grown, and by an odd chance the average height ofthe two lots was exactly the same, namely, 35.96 inches; so that neitherside had the least advantage over the other. To test this result, allthe plants on both sides in ten out of the above fourteen pots were cutdown after they had flowered, and in the ensuing year the stems wereagain measured; and now the crossed plants exceeded by a little (namely,1.7 inches) the self-fertilised. They were again cut down, and on theirflowering for the third time, the self-fertilised plants had a slightadvantage (namely, 1.54 inches) over the crossed. Hence the resultarrived at with these plants during the previous trials was confirmed,namely, that neither lot had any decided advantage over the other. Itmay, however, be worth mentioning that the self-fertilised plants showedsome tendency to flower before the crossed plants: this occurred withall three pairs of the first generation; and with the cut down plants ofthe third generation, a self-fertilised plant flowered first in nine outof the twelve pots, whilst in the remaining three pots a crossed plantflowered first.If we consider all the plants of the three generations taken together,the thirty-four crossed plants average 35.98, and the thirty-fourself-fertilised plants 36.39 inches in height; or as 100 to 101. We maytherefore conclude that the two lots possessed equal powers of growth;and this I believe to be the result of long-continuedself-fertilisation, together with exposure to similar conditions in eachgeneration, so that all the individuals had acquired a closely similarconstitution.30. GRAMINACEAE.--Zea mays.This plant is monoecious, and was selected for trial on this account, noother such plant having been experimented on. (6/8. Hildebrand remarksthat this species seems at first sight adapted to be fertilised bypollen from the same plant, owing to the male flowers standing above thefemale flowers; but practically it must generally be fertilised bypollen from another plant, as the male flowers usually shed their pollenbefore the female flowers are mature: 'Monatsbericht der K. Akad.'Berlin October 1872 page 743.) It is also anemophilous, or is fertilisedby the wind; and of such plants only the common beet had been tried.Some plants were raised in the greenhouse, and were crossed with pollentaken from a distinct plant; and a single plant, growing quiteseparately in a different part of the house, was allowed to fertiliseitself spontaneously. The seeds thus obtained were placed on damp sand,and as they germinated in pairs of equal age were planted on theopposite sides of four very large pots; nevertheless they wereconsiderably crowded. The pots were kept in the hothouse. The plantswere first measured to the tips of their leaves when only between 1 and2 feet in height, as shown in Table 6/97.TABLE 6/97.

Mr.Galton made a graphical representation, in accordance with the methoddescribed in the introductory chapter, of the above measurements, andadds the words "very good" to the curves thus formed.Shortly afterwards one of the crossed plants in Pot 1 died; anotherbecame much diseased and stunted; and the third never grew to its fullheight. They seemed to have been all injured, probably by some larvagnawing their roots. Therefore all the plants on both sides of this potwere rejected in the subsequent measurements. When the plants were fullygrown they were again measured to the tips of the highest leaves, andthe eleven crossed plants now averaged 68.1, and the elevenself-fertilised plants 62.34 inches in height; or as 100 to 91. In allfour pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of theself-fertilised; but three of the plants did not flower at all. Thosethat flowered were also measured to the summits of the male flowers: theten crossed plants averaged 66.51, and the nine self-fertilised plants61.59 inches in height; or as 100 to 93.A large number of the same crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sownin the middle of the summer in the open ground in two long rows. Verymuch fewer of the self-fertilised than of the crossed plants producedflowers; but those that did flower, flowered almost simultaneously. Whenfully grown the ten tallest plants in each row were selected andmeasured to the tips of their highest leaves, as well as to the summitsof their male flowers. The crossed averaged to the tips of their leaves54 inches in height, and the self-fertilised 44.65, or as 100 to 83; andto the summits of their male flowers, 53.96 and 43.45 inches; or as 100to 80.Phalaris canariensis.Hildebrand has shown in the paper referred to under the last species,that this hermaphrodite grass is better adapted for cross-fertilisationthan for self-fertilisation. Several plants were raised in thegreenhouse close together, and their flowers were mutually intercrossed.Pollen from a single plant growing quite separately was collected andplaced on the stigmas of the same plant. The seeds thus produced wereself-fertilised, for they were fertilised with pollen from the sameplant, but it will have been a mere chance whether with pollen from thesame flowers. Both lots of seeds, after germinating on sand, wereplanted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots, which were kept inthe greenhouse. When the plants were a little over a foot in height theywere measured, and the crossed plants averaged 13.38, and theself-fertilised 12.29 inches in height; or as 100 to 92.When in full flower they were again measured to the extremities of theirculms, as shown in Table 6/98.TABLE 6/98. Phalaris canariensis.Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Number (Name) of Pot.Column 2: Crossed Plants.Column 3: Self-fertilised Plants.Pot 1  :   42 2/8 :  41 2/8.Pot 1  :   39 6/8 :  45 4/8.Pot 2  :   37     :  31 6/8.Pot 2  :   49 4/8 :  37 2/8.Pot 4  :   29     :  42 3/8.Pot 2  :   37     :  34 7/8.Pot 3  :   37 6/8 :  28.Pot 3  :   35 4/8 :  28.Pot 3  :   43     :  34.Pot 4  :   40 2/8 :  35 1/8.Pot 4  :   37     :  34 4/8.Total  :  428.00  : 392.63.The eleven crossed plants now averaged 38.9, and the elevenself-fertilised plants 35.69 inches in height; or as 100 to 92, which isthe same ratio as before. Differently to what occurred with the maize,the crossed plants did not flower before the self-fertilised; and thoughboth lots flowered very poorly from having been kept in pots in thegreenhouse, yet the self-fertilised plants produced twenty-eightflower-heads, whilst the crossed produced only twenty!Two long rows of the same seeds were sown out of doors, and care wastaken that they were sown in nearly equal number; but a far greaternumber of the crossed than of the self-fertilised seeds yielded plants.The self-fertilised plants were in consequence not so much crowded asthe crossed, and thus had an advantage over them. When in full flower,the twelve tallest plants were carefully selected from both rows andmeasured, as shown in Table 6/99.TABLE 6/99. Phalaris canariensis (growing in the open ground).Heights of plants measured in inches.Column 1: Crossed Plants, twelve tallest.Column 2: Self-fertilised Plants, twelve tallest.          34 1/8 :  35 2/8.          35 7/8 :  31 1/8.          36     :  33.          35 5/8 :  32.          35 5/8 :  31 5/8.          36 1/8 :  36.          36 6/8 :  33.          38 6/8 :  32.          36 2/8 :  35 1/8.          35 5/8 :  33 5/8.          34 1/8 :  34 2/8.          34 5/8 :  35.Total :  429.5   : 402.0.The twelve crossed plants here average 35.78, and the twelveself-fertilised 33.5 inches in height; or as 100 to 93. In this case thecrossed plants flowered rather before the self-fertilised, and thusdiffered from those growing in the pots.]CHAPTER VII.SUMMARY OF THE HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS OF THE CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISEDPLANTS.Number of species and plants measured.Tables given.Preliminary remarks on the offspring of plants crossed by a fresh stock.Thirteen cases specially considered.The effects of crossing a self-fertilised plant either by anotherself-fertilised plant or by an intercrossed plant of the old stock.Summary of the results.Preliminary remarks on the crossed and self-fertilised plants of thesame stock.The twenty-six exceptional cases considered, in which the crossed plantsdid not exceed greatly in height the self-fertilised.Most of these cases shown not to be real exceptions to the rule thatcross-fertilisation is beneficial.Summary of results.Relative weights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants.The details which have been given under the head of each species are sonumerous and so intricate, that it is necessary to tabulate the results.In Table 7/A, the number of plants of each kind which were raised from across between two individuals of the same stock and from self-fertilisedseeds, together with their mean or average heights, are given. In theright hand column, the mean height of the crossed to that of theself-fertilised plants, the former being taken as 100, is shown. To makethis clear, it may be advisable to give an example. In the firstgeneration of Ipomoea, six plants derived from a cross between twoplants were measured, and their mean height is 86.00 inches; six plantsderived from flowers on the same parent-plant fertilised with their ownpollen were measured, and their mean height is 65.66 inches. From thisit follows, as shown in the right hand column, that if the mean heightof the crossed plants be taken as 100, that of the self-fertilisedplants is 76. The same plan is followed with all the other species.The crossed and self-fertilised plants were generally grown in pots incompetition with one another, and always under as closely similarconditions as could be attained. They were, however, sometimes grown inseparate rows in the open ground. With several of the species, thecrossed plants were again crossed, and the self-fertilised plants againself-fertilised, and thus successive generations were raised andmeasured, as may be seen in Table 7/A. Owing to this manner ofproceeding, the crossed plants became in the later generations more orless closely inter-related.In Table 7/B the relative weights of the crossed and self-fertilisedplants, after they had flowered and had been cut down, are given in thefew cases in which they were ascertained. The results are, I think, morestriking and of greater value as evidence of constitutional vigour thanthose deduced from the relative heights of the plants.The most important table is Table 7/C, as it includes the relativeheights, weights, and fertility of plants raised from parents crossed bya fresh stock (that is, by non-related plants grown under differentconditions), or by a distinct sub-variety, in comparison withself-fertilised plants, or in a few cases with plants of the same oldstock intercrossed during several generations. The relative fertility ofthe plants in this and the other tables will be more fully considered ina future chapter.TABLE 7/A.

measurements of fifty-seven species, belongingto fifty-two genera and to thirty great natural families, are given. Thespecies are natives of various parts of the world. The number of crossedplants, including those derived from a cross between plants of the samestock and of two different stocks, amounts to 1,101; and the number ofself-fertilised plants (including a few in Table 7/C derived from across between plants of the same old stock) is 1,076. Their growth wasobserved from the germination of the seeds to maturity; and most of themwere measured twice and some thrice. The various precautions taken toprevent either lot being unduly favoured, have been described in theintroductory chapter. Bearing all these circumstances in mind, it may beadmitted that we have a fair basis for judging of the comparativeeffects of cross-fertilisation and of self-fertilisation on the growthof the offspring.It will be the most convenient plan first to consider the results givenin Table 7/C, as an opportunity will thus be afforded of incidentallydiscussing some important points. If the reader will look down the righthand column of this table, he will see at a glance what an extraordinaryadvantage in height, weight, and fertility the plants derived from across with a fresh stock or with another sub-variety have over theself-fertilised plants, as well as over the intercrossed plants of thesame old stock. There are only two exceptions to this rule, and theseare hardly real ones. In the case of Eschscholtzia, the advantage isconfined to fertility. In that of Petunia, though the plants derivedfrom a cross with a fresh stock had an immense superiority in height,weight, and fertility over the self-fertilised plants, they wereconquered by the intercrossed plants of the same old stock in height andweight, but not in fertility. It has, however, been shown that thesuperiority of these intercrossed plants in height and weight was in allprobability not real; for if the two sets had been allowed to grow foranother month, it is almost certain that those from a cross with thefresh stock would have been victorious in every way over theintercrossed plants.Before we consider in detail the several cases given in Table 7/C, somepreliminary remarks must be made. There is the clearest evidence, as weshall presently see, that the advantage of a cross depends wholly on theplants differing somewhat in constitution; and that the disadvantages ofself-fertilisation depend on the two parents, which are combined in thesame hermaphrodite flower, having a closely similar constitution. Acertain amount of differentiation in the sexual elements seemsindispensable for the full fertility of the parents, and for the fullvigour of the offspring. All the individuals of the same species, eventhose produced in a state of nature, differ somewhat, though often veryslightly, from one another in external characters and probably inconstitution. This obviously holds good between the varieties of thesame species, as far as external characters are concerned; and muchevidence could be advanced with respect to their generally differingsomewhat in constitution. There can hardly be a doubt that thedifferences of all kinds between the individuals and varieties of thesame species depend largely, and as I believe exclusively, on theirprogenitors having been subjected to different conditions; though theconditions to which the individuals of the same species are exposed in astate of nature often falsely appear to us the same. For instance, theindividuals growing together are necessarily exposed to the sameclimate, and they seem to us at first sight to be subjected toidentically the same conditions; but this can hardly be the case, exceptunder the unusual contingency of each individual being surrounded byother kinds of plants in exactly the same proportional numbers. For thesurrounding plants absorb different amounts of various substances fromthe soil, and thus greatly affect the nourishment and even the life ofthe individuals of any particular species. These will also be shaded andotherwise affected by the nature of the surrounding plants. Moreover,seeds often lie dormant in the ground, and those which germinate duringany one year will often have been matured during very different seasons.Seeds are widely dispersed by various means, and some will occasionallybe brought from distant stations, where their parents have grown undersomewhat different conditions, and the plants produced from such seedswill intercross with the old residents, thus mingling theirconstitutional peculiarities in all sorts of proportions.Plants when first subjected to culture, even in their native country,cannot fail to be exposed to greatly changed conditions of life, moreespecially from growing in cleared ground, and from not having tocompete with many or any surrounding plants. They are thus enabled toabsorb whatever they require which the soil may contain. Fresh seeds areoften brought from distant gardens, where the parent-plants have beensubjected to different conditions. Cultivated plants like those in astate of nature frequently intercross, and will thus mingle theirconstitutional peculiarities. On the other hand, as long as theindividuals of any species are cultivated in the same garden, they willapparently be subjected to more uniform conditions than plants in astate of nature, as the individuals have not to compete with varioussurrounding species. The seeds sown at the same time in a garden havegenerally been matured during the same season and in the same place; andin this respect they differ much from the seeds sown by the hand ofnature. Some exotic plants are not frequented by the native insects intheir new home, and therefore are not intercrossed; and this appears tobe a highly important factor in the individuals acquiring uniformity ofconstitution.In my experiments the greatest care was taken that in each generationall the crossed and self-fertilised plants should be subjected to thesame conditions. Not that the conditions were absolutely the same, forthe more vigorous individuals will have robbed the weaker ones ofnutriment, and likewise of water when the soil in the pots was becomingdry; and both lots at one end of the pot will have received a littlemore light than those at the other end. In the successive generations,the plants were subjected to somewhat different conditions, for theseasons necessarily varied, and they were sometimes raised at differentperiods of the year. But as they were all kept under glass, they wereexposed to far less abrupt and great changes of temperature and moisturethan are plants growing out of doors. With respect to the intercrossedplants, their first parents, which were not related, would almostcertainly have differed somewhat in constitution; and suchconstitutional peculiarities would be variously mingled in eachsucceeding intercrossed generation, being sometimes augmented, but morecommonly neutralised in a greater or less degree, and sometimes revivedthrough reversion; just as we know to be the case with the externalcharacters of crossed species and varieties. With the plants which wereself-fertilised during the successive generations, this latter importantsource of some diversity of constitution will have been whollyeliminated; and the sexual elements produced by the same flower musthave been developed under as nearly the same conditions as it ispossible to conceive.In Table 7/C the crossed plants are the offspring of a cross with afresh stock, or with a distinct variety; and they were put intocompetition either with self-fertilised plants, or with intercrossedplants of the same old stock. By the term fresh stock I mean anon-related plant, the progenitors of which have been raised during somegenerations in another garden, and have consequently been exposed tosomewhat different conditions. In the case of Nicotiana, Iberis, the redvariety of Primula, the common Pea, and perhaps Anagallis, the plantswhich were crossed may be ranked as distinct varieties or sub-varietiesof the same species; but with Ipomoea, Mimulus, Dianthus, and Petunia,the plants which were crossed differed exclusively in the tint of theirflowers; and as a large proportion of the plants raised from the samelot of purchased seeds thus varied, the differences may be estimated asmerely individual. Having made these preliminary remarks, we will nowconsider in detail the several cases given in Table 7/C, and they arewell worthy of full consideration.1. Ipomoea purpurea.Plants growing in the same pots, and subjected in each generation to thesame conditions, were intercrossed for nine consecutive generations.These intercrossed plants thus became in the later generations more orless closely inter-related. Flowers on the plants of the ninthintercrossed generation were fertilised with pollen taken from a freshstock, and seedlings thus raised. Other flowers on the same intercrossedplants were fertilised with pollen from another intercrossed plant,producing seedlings of the tenth intercrossed generation. These two setsof seedlings were grown in competition with one another, and differedgreatly in height and fertility. For the offspring from the cross with afresh stock exceeded in height the intercrossed plants in the ratio of100 to 78; and this is nearly the same excess which the intercrossed hadover the self-fertilised plants in all ten generations taken together,namely, as 100 to 77. The plants raised from the cross with a freshstock were also greatly superior in fertility to the intercrossed,namely, in the ratio of 100 to 51, as judged by the relative weight ofthe seed-capsules produced by an equal number of plants of the two sets,both having been left to be naturally fertilised. It should beespecially observed that none of the plants of either lot were theproduct of self-fertilisation. On the contrary, the intercrossed plantshad certainly been crossed for the last ten generations, and probably,during all previous generations, as we may infer from the structure ofthe flowers and from the frequency of the visits of humble-bees. And soit will have been with the parent-plants of the fresh stock. The wholegreat difference in height and fertility between the two lots must beattributed to the one being the product of a cross with pollen from afresh stock, and the other of a cross between plants of the same oldstock.This species offers another interesting case. In the five firstgenerations in which intercrossed and self-fertilised plants were putinto competition with one another, every single intercrossed plant beatits self-fertilised antagonist, except in one instance, in which theywere equal in height. But in the sixth generation a plant appeared,named by me the Hero, remarkable for its tallness and increasedself-fertility, and which transmitted its characters to the next threegenerations. The children of Hero were again self-fertilised, formingthe eighth self-fertilised generation, and were likewise intercrossedone with another; but this cross between plants which had been subjectedto the same conditions and had been self-fertilised during the sevenprevious generations, did not effect the least good; for theintercrossed grandchildren were actually shorter than theself-fertilised grandchildren, in the ratio of 100 to 107. We here seethat the mere act of crossing two distinct plants does not by itselfbenefit the offspring. This case is almost the converse of that in thelast paragraph, on which the offspring profited so greatly by a crosswith a fresh stock. A similar trial was made with the descendants ofHero in the following generation, and with the same result. But thetrial cannot be fully trusted, owing to the extremely unhealthycondition of the plants. Subject to this same serious cause of doubt,even a cross with a fresh stock did not benefit the great-grandchildrenof Hero; and if this were really the case, it is the greatest anomalyobserved by me in all my experiments.2. Mimulus luteus.During the three first generations the intercrossed plants takentogether exceeded in height the self-fertilised taken together, in theratio of 100 to 65, and in fertility in a still higher degree. In thefourth generation a new variety, which grew taller and had whiter andlarger flowers than the old varieties, began to prevail, especiallyamongst the self-fertilised plants. This variety transmitted itscharacters with remarkable fidelity, so that all the plants in the laterself-fertilised generations belonged to it. These consequently exceededthe intercrossed plants considerably in height. Thus in the seventhgeneration the intercrossed plants were to the self-fertilised in heightas 100 to 137. It is a more remarkable fact that the self-fertilisedplants of the sixth generation had become much more fertile than theintercrossed plants, judging by the number of capsules spontaneouslyproduced, in the ratio of 147 to 100. This variety, which as we haveseen appeared amongst the plants of the fourth self-fertilisedgeneration, resembles in almost all its constitutional peculiarities thevariety called Hero which appeared in the sixth self-fertilisedgeneration of Ipomoea. No other such case, with the partial exception ofthat of Nicotiana, occurred in my experiments, carried on during elevenyears.Two plants of this variety of Mimulus, belonging to the sixthself-fertilised generation, and growing in separate pots, wereintercrossed; and some flowers on the same plants were againself-fertilised. From the seeds thus obtained, plants derived from across between the self-fertilised plants, and others of the seventhself-fertilised generation, were raised. But this cross did not do theleast good, the intercrossed plants being inferior in height to theself-fertilised, in the ratio of 100 to 110. This case is exactlyparallel with that given under Ipomoea, of the grandchildren of Hero,and apparently of its great-grandchildren; for the seedlings raised byintercrossing these plants were not in any way superior to those of thecorresponding generation raised from the self-fertilised flowers.Therefore in these several cases the crossing of plants, which had beenself-fertilised for several generations and which had been cultivatedall the time under as nearly as possible the same conditions, was not inthe least beneficial.Another experiment was now tried. Firstly, plants of the eighthself-fertilised generation were again self-fertilised, producing plantsof the ninth self-fertilised generation. Secondly, two of the plants ofthe eighth self-fertilised generation were intercrossed one withanother, as in the experiment above referred to; but this was noweffected on plants which had been subjected to two additionalgenerations of self-fertilisation. Thirdly, the same plants of theeighth self-fertilised generation were crossed with pollen from plantsof a fresh stock brought from a distant garden. Numerous plants wereraised from these three sets of seeds, and grown in competition with oneanother. The plants derived from a cross between the self-fertilisedplants exceeded in height by a little the self-fertilised, namely, as100 to 92; and in fertility in a greater degree, namely, as 100 to 73. Ido not know whether this difference in the result, compared with that inthe previous case, can be accounted for by the increased deteriorationof the self-fertilised plants from two additional generations ofself-fertilisation, and the consequent advantage of any cross whatever,along merely between the self-fertilised plants. But however this maybe, the effects of crossing the self-fertilised plants of the eighthgeneration with a fresh stock were extremely striking; for the seedlingsthus raised were to the self-fertilised of the ninth generation as 100to 52 in height, and as 100 to 3 in fertility! They were also to theintercrossed plants (derived from crossing two of the self-fertilisedplants of the eighth generation) in height as 100 to 56, and infertility as 100 to 4. Better evidence could hardly be desired of thepotent influence of a cross with a fresh stock on plants which had beenself-fertilised for eight generations, and had been cultivated all thetime under nearly uniform conditions, in comparison with plantsself-fertilised for nine generations continuously, or then onceintercrossed, namely in the last generation.3. Brassica oleracea.Some flowers on cabbage plants of the second self-fertilised generationwere crossed with pollen from a plant of the same variety brought from adistant garden, and other flowers were again self-fertilised. Plantsderived from a cross with a fresh stock and plants of the thirdself-fertilised generation were thus raised. The former were to theself-fertilised in weight as 100 to 22; and this enormous differencemust be attributed in part to the beneficial effects of a cross with afresh stock, and in part to the deteriorating effects ofself-fertilisation continued during three generations.4. Iberis umbellata.Seedlings from a crimson English variety crossed by a pale-colouredvariety which had been grown for some generations in Algiers, were tothe self-fertilised seedlings from the crimson variety in height as 100to 89, and as 100 to 75 in fertility. I am surprised that this crosswith another variety did not produce a still more strongly markedbeneficial effect; for some intercrossed plants of the crimson Englishvariety, put into competition with plants of the same varietyself-fertilised during three generations, were in height as 100 to 86,and in fertility as 100 to 75. The slightly greater difference in heightin this latter case, may possibly be attributed to the deterioratingeffects of self-fertilisation carried on for two additional generations.5. Eschscholtzia californica.This plant offers an almost unique case, inasmuch as the good effects ofa cross are confined to the reproductive system. Intercrossed andself-fertilised plants of the English stock did not differ in height(nor in weight, as far as was ascertained) in any constant manner; theself-fertilised plants usually having the advantage. So it was with theoffspring of plants of the Brazilian stock, tried in the same manner.The parent-plants, however, of the English stock produced many moreseeds when fertilised with pollen from another plant than whenself-fertilised; and in Brazil the parent-plants were absolutely sterileunless they were fertilised with pollen from another plant. Intercrossedseedlings, raised in England from the Brazilian stock, compared withself-fertilised seedlings of the corresponding second generation,yielded seeds in number as 100 to 89; both lots of plants being leftfreely exposed to the visits of insects. If we now turn to the effectsof crossing plants of the Brazilian stock with pollen from the Englishstock,--so that plants which had been long exposed to very differentconditions were intercrossed,--we find that the offspring were, asbefore, inferior in height and weight to the plants of the Brazilianstock after two generations of self-fertilisation, but were superior tothem in the most marked manner in the number of seeds produced, namely,as 100 to 40; both lots of plants being left freely exposed to thevisits of insects.In the case of Ipomoea, we have seen that the plants derived from across with a fresh stock were superior in height as 100 to 78, and infertility as 100 to 51, to the plants of the old stock, although thesehad been intercrossed during the last ten generations. WithEschscholtzia we have a nearly parallel case, but only as far asfertility is concerned, for the plants derived from a cross with a freshstock were superior in fertility in the ratio of 100 to 45 to theBrazilian plants, which had been artificially intercrossed in Englandfor the two last generations, and which must have been naturallyintercrossed by insects during all previous generations in Brazil, whereotherwise they are quite sterile.6. Dianthus caryophyllus.Plants self-fertilised for three generations were crossed with pollenfrom a fresh stock, and their offspring were grown in competition withplants of the fourth self-fertilised generation. The crossed plants thusobtained were to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 81, and infertility (both lots being left to be naturally fertilised by insects)as 100 to 33.These same crossed plants were also to the offspring from the plants ofthe third generation crossed by the intercrossed plants of thecorresponding generation, in height as 100 to 85, and in fertility as100 to 45.We thus see what a great advantage the offspring from a cross with afresh stock had, not only over the self-fertilised plants of the fourthgeneration, but over the offspring from the self-fertilised plants ofthe third generation, when crossed by the intercrossed plants of the oldstock.7. Pisum sativum.It has been shown under the head of this species, that the severalvarieties in this country almost invariably fertilise themselves, owingto insects rarely visiting the flowers; and as the plants have been longcultivated under nearly similar conditions, we can understand why across between two individuals of the same variety does not do the leastgood to the offspring either in height or fertility. This case is almostexactly parallel with that of Mimulus, or that of the Ipomoea namedHero; for in these two instances, crossing plants which had beenself-fertilised for seven generations did not at all benefit theoffspring. On the other hand, a cross between two varieties of the peacauses a marked superiority in the growth and vigour of the offspring,over the self-fertilised plants of the same varieties, as shown by twoexcellent observers. From my own observations (not made with great care)the offspring from crossed varieties were to self-fertilised plants inheight, in one case as 100 to about 75, and in a second case as 100 to60.8. Lathyrus odoratus.The sweet-pea is in the same state in regard to self-fertilisation asthe common pea; and we have seen that seedlings from a cross between twovarieties, which differed in no respect except in the colour of theirflowers, were to the self-fertilised seedlings from the samemother-plant in height as 100 to 80; and in the second generation as 100to 88. Unfortunately I did not ascertain whether crossing two plants ofthe same variety failed to produce any beneficial effect, but I ventureto predict such would be the result.9. Petunia violacea.The intercrossed plants of the same stock in four out of the fivesuccessive generations plainly exceeded in height the self-fertilisedplants. The latter in the fourth generation were crossed by a freshstock, and the seedlings thus obtained were put into competition withthe self-fertilised plants of the fifth generation. The crossed plantsexceeded the self-fertilised in height in the ratio of 100 to 66, and inweight as 100 to 23; but this difference, though so great, is not muchgreater than that between the intercrossed plants of the same stock incomparison with the self-fertilised plants of the correspondinggeneration. This case, therefore, seems at first sight opposed to therule that a cross with a fresh stock is much more beneficial than across between individuals of the same stock. But as with Eschscholtzia,the reproductive system was here chiefly benefited; for the plantsraised from the cross with the fresh stock were to the self-fertilisedplants in fertility, both lots being naturally fertilised, as 100 to 46,whereas the intercrossed plants of the same stock were to theself-fertilised plants of the corresponding fifth generation infertility only as 100 to 86.Although at the time of measurement the plants raised from the crosswith the fresh stock did not exceed in height or weight the intercrossedplants of the old stock (owing to the growth of the former not havingbeen completed, as explained under the head of this species), yet theyexceeded the intercrossed plants in fertility in the ratio of 100 to 54.This fact is interesting, as it shows that plants self-fertilised forfour generations and then crossed by a fresh stock, yielded seedlingswhich were nearly twice as fertile as those from plants of the samestock which had been intercrossed for the five previous generations. Wehere see, as with Eschscholtzia and Dianthus, that the mere act ofcrossing, independently of the state of the crossed plants, has littleefficacy in giving increased fertility to the offspring. The sameconclusion holds good, as we have already seen, in the analogous casesof Ipomoea, Mimulus, and Dianthus, with respect to height.10. Nicotiana tabacum.My plants were remarkably self-fertile, and the capsules from theself-fertilised flowers apparently yielded more seeds than those whichwere cross-fertilised. No insects were seen to visit the flowers in thehothouse, and I suspect that the stock on which I experimented had beenraised under glass, and had been self-fertilised during several previousgenerations; if so, we can understand why, in the course of threegenerations, the crossed seedlings of the same stock did not uniformlyexceed in height the self-fertilised seedlings. But the case iscomplicated by individual plants having different constitutions, so thatsome of the crossed and self-fertilised seedlings raised at the sametime from the same parents behaved differently. However this may be,plants raised from self-fertilised plants of the third generationcrossed by a slightly different sub-variety, exceeded greatly in heightand weight the self-fertilised plants of the fourth generation; and thetrial was made on a large scale. They exceeded them in height when grownin pots, and not much crowded, in the ratio of 100 to 66; and when muchcrowded, as 100 to 54. These crossed plants, when thus subjected tosevere competition, also exceeded the self-fertilised in weight in theratio of 100 to 37. So it was, but in a less degree (as may be seen inTable 7/C), when the two lots were grown out of doors and not subjectedto any mutual competition. Nevertheless, strange as is the fact, theflowers on the mother-plants of the third self-fertilised generation didnot yield more seed when they were crossed with pollen from plants ofthe fresh stock than when they were self-fertilised.11. Anagallis collina.Plants raised from a red variety crossed by another plant of the samevariety were in height to the self-fertilised plants from the redvariety as 100 to 73. When the flowers on the red variety werefertilised with pollen from a closely similar blue-flowered variety,they yielded double the number of seeds to what they did when crossed bypollen from another individual of the same red variety, and the seedswere much finer. The plants raised from this cross between the twovarieties were to the self-fertilised seedlings from the red variety, inheight as 100 to 66, and in fertility as 100 to 6.12. Primula veris.Some flowers on long-styled plants of the third illegitimate generationwere legitimately crossed with pollen from a fresh stock, and otherswere fertilised with their own pollen. From the seeds thus producedcrossed plants, and self-fertilised plants of the fourth illegitimategeneration, were raised. The former were to the latter in height as 100to 46, and in fertility during one year as 100 to 5, and as 100 to 3.5during the next year. In this case, however, we have no means ofdistinguishing between the evil effects of illegitimate fertilisationcontinued during four generations (that is, by pollen of the same form,but taken from a distinct plant) and strict self-fertilisation. But itis probable that these two processes do not differ so essentially as atfirst appears to be the case. In the following experiment any doubtarising from illegitimate fertilisation was completely eliminated.13. Primula veris. (Equal-styled, red-flowered variety.)Flowers on plants of the second self-fertilised generation were crossedwith pollen from a distinct variety or fresh stock, and others wereagain self-fertilised. Crossed plants and plants of the thirdself-fertilised generation, all of legitimate origin, were thus raised;and the former was to the latter in height as 100 to 85, and infertility (as judged by the number of capsules produced, together withthe average number of seeds) as 100 to 11.SUMMARY OF THE MEASUREMENTS IN TABLE 7/C.This table includes the heights and often the weights of 292 plantsderived from a cross with a fresh stock, and of 305 plants, either ofself-fertilised origin, or derived from an intercross between plants ofthe same stock. These 597 plants belong to thirteen species and twelvegenera. The various precautions which were taken to ensure a faircomparison have already been stated. If we now look down the right handcolumn, in which the mean height, weight, and fertility of the plantsderived from a cross with a fresh stock are represented by 100, we shallsee by the other figures how wonderfully superior they are both to theself-fertilised and to the intercrossed plants of the same stock. Withrespect to height and weight, there are only two exceptions to the rule,namely, with Eschscholtzia and Petunia, and the latter is probably noreal exception. Nor do these two species offer an exception in regard tofertility, for the plants derived from the cross with a fresh stock weremuch more fertile than the self-fertilised plants. The differencebetween the two sets of plants in the table is generally much greater infertility than in height or weight. On the other hand, with some of thespecies, as with Nicotiana, there was no difference in fertility betweenthe two sets, although a great difference in height and weight.Considering all the cases in this table, there can be no doubt thatplants profit immensely, though in different ways, by a cross with afresh stock or with a distinct sub-variety. It cannot be maintained thatthe benefit thus derived is due merely to the plants of the fresh stockbeing perfectly healthy, whilst those which had been long intercrossedor self-fertilised had become unhealthy; for in most cases there was noappearance of such unhealthiness, and we shall see under Table 7/A thatthe intercrossed plants of the same stock are generally superior to acertain extent to the self-fertilised,--both lots having been subjectedto exactly the same conditions and being equally healthy or unhealthy.We further learn from Table 7/C, that a cross between plants that havebeen self-fertilised during several successive generations and kept allthe time under nearly uniform conditions, does not benefit the offspringin the least or only in a very slight degree. Mimulus and thedescendants of Ipomoea named Hero offer instances of this rule. Again,plants self-fertilised during several generations profit only to a smallextent by a cross with intercrossed plants of the same stock (as in thecase of Dianthus), in comparison with the effects of a cross by a freshstock. Plants of the same stock intercrossed during several generations(as with Petunia) were inferior in a marked manner in fertility to thosederived from the corresponding self-fertilised plants crossed by a freshstock. Lastly, certain plants which are regularly intercrossed byinsects in a state of nature, and which were artificially crossed ineach succeeding generation in the course of my experiments, so that theycan never or most rarely have suffered any evil from self-fertilisation(as with Eschscholtzia and Ipomoea), nevertheless profited greatly by across with a fresh stock. These several cases taken together show us inthe clearest manner that it is not the mere crossing of any twoindividuals which is beneficial to the offspring. The benefit thusderived depends on the plants which are united differing in some manner,and there can hardly be a doubt that it is in the constitution or natureof the sexual elements. Anyhow, it is certain that the differences arenot of an external nature, for two plants which resemble each other asclosely as the individuals of the same species ever do, profit in theplainest manner when intercrossed, if their progenitors have beenexposed during several generations to different conditions. But to thislatter subject I shall have to recur in a future chapter.TABLE 7/A.We will now turn to our first table, which relates to crossed andself-fertilised plants of the same stock. These consist of fifty-fourspecies belonging to thirty natural orders. The total number of crossedplants of which measurements are given is 796, and of self-fertilised809; that is altogether 1,605 plants. Some of the species wereexperimented on during several successive generations; and it should beborne in mind that in such cases the crossed plants in each generationwere crossed with pollen from another crossed plant, and the flowers onthe self-fertilised plants were almost always fertilised with their ownpollen, though sometimes with pollen from other flowers on the sameplant. The crossed plants thus became more or less closely inter-relatedin the later generations; and both lots were subjected in eachgeneration to almost absolutely the same conditions, and to nearly thesame conditions in the successive generations. It would have been abetter plan in some respects if I had always crossed some flowers eitheron the self-fertilised or intercrossed plants of each generation withpollen from a non-related plant, grown under different conditions, aswas done with the plants in Table 7/C; for by this procedure I shouldhave learnt how much the offspring became deteriorated through continuedself-fertilisation in the successive generations. As the case stands,the self-fertilised plants of the successive generations in Table 7/Awere put into competition with and compared with intercrossed plants,which were probably deteriorated in some degree by being more or lessinter-related and grown under similar conditions. Nevertheless, had Ialways followed the plan in Table 7/C, I should not have discovered theimportant fact that, although a cross between plants which are ratherclosely related and which had been subjected to closely similarconditions, gives during several generations some advantage to theoffspring, yet that after a time they may be intercrossed with noadvantage whatever to the offspring. Nor should I have learnt that theself-fertilised plants of the later generations might be crossed withintercrossed plants of the same stock with little or no advantage,although they profited to an extraordinary degree by a cross with afresh stock.With respect to the greater number of the plants in Table 7/A, nothingspecial need here be said; full particulars may be found under the headof each species by the aid of the Index. The figures in the right-handcolumn show the mean height of the self-fertilised plants, that of thecrossed plants with which they competed being represented by 100. Nonotice is here taken of the few cases in which crossed andself-fertilised plants were grown in the open ground, so as not tocompete together. The table includes, as we have seen, plants belongingto fifty-four species, but as some of these were measured during severalsuccessive generations, there are eighty-three cases in which crossedand self-fertilised plants were compared. As in each generation thenumber of plants which were measured (given in the table) was never verylarge and sometimes small, whenever in the right hand column the meanheight of the crossed and self-fertilised plants is the same within fiveper cent, their heights may be considered as practically equal. Of suchcases, that is, of self-fertilised plants of which the mean height isexpressed by figures between 95 and 105, there are eighteen, either insome one or all the generations. There are eight cases in which theself-fertilised plants exceed the crossed by above five per cent, asshown by the figures in the right hand column being above 105. Lastly,there are fifty-seven cases in which the crossed plants exceed theself-fertilised in a ratio of at least 100 to 95, and generally in amuch higher degree.If the relative heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants hadbeen due to mere chance, there would have been about as many cases ofself-fertilised plants exceeding the crossed in height by above five percent as of the crossed thus exceeding the self-fertilised; but we seethat of the latter there are fifty-seven cases, and of the former onlyeight cases; so that the cases in which the crossed plants exceed inheight the self-fertilised in the above proportion are more than seventimes as numerous as those in which the self-fertilised exceed thecrossed in the same proportion. For our special purpose of comparing thepowers of growth of crossed and self-fertilised plants, it may be saidthat in fifty-seven cases the crossed plants exceeded theself-fertilised by more than five per cent, and that in twenty-six cases(18 + 8) they did not thus exceed them. But we shall now show that inseveral of these twenty-six cases the crossed plants had a decidedadvantage over the self-fertilised in other respects, though not inheight; that in other cases the mean heights are not trustworthy, owingto too few plants having been measured, or to their having grownunequally from being unhealthy, or to both causes combined.Nevertheless, as these cases are opposed to my general conclusion I havefelt bound to give them. Lastly, the cause of the crossed plants havingno advantage over the self-fertilised can be explained in some othercases. Thus a very small residue is left in which the self-fertilisedplants appear, as far as my experiments serve, to be really equal orsuperior to the crossed plants.We will now consider in some little detail the eighteen cases in whichthe self-fertilised plants equalled in average height the crossed plantswithin five per cent; and the eight cases in which the self-fertilisedplants exceeded in average height the crossed plants by above five percent; making altogether twenty-six cases in which the crossed plantswere not taller than the self-fertilised plants in any marked degree.[1. Dianthus caryophyllus (third generation).This plant was experimented on during four generations, in three ofwhich the crossed plants exceeded in height the self-fertilisedgenerally by much more than five per cent; and we have seen under Table7/C that the offspring from the plants of the third self-fertilisedgeneration crossed by a fresh stock profited in height and fertility toan extraordinary degree. But in this third generation the crossed plantsof the same stock were in height to the self-fertilised only as 100 to99, that is, they were practically equal. Nevertheless, when the eightcrossed and eight self-fertilised plants were cut down and weighed, theformer were to the latter in weight as 100 to 49! There can therefore benot the least doubt that the crossed plants of this species are greatlysuperior in vigour and luxuriance to the self-fertilised; and what wasthe cause of the self-fertilised plants of the third generation, thoughso light and thin, growing up so as almost to equal the crossed inheight, I cannot explain.2. Lobelia fulgens (first generation).The crossed plants of this generation were much inferior in height tothe self-fertilised, in the proportion of 100 to 127. Although only twopairs were measured, which is obviously much too few to be trusted, yetfrom other evidence given under the head of this species, it is certainthat the self-fertilised plants were very much more vigorous than thecrossed. As I used pollen of unequal maturity for crossing andself-fertilising the parent-plants, it is possible that the greatdifference in the growth of their offspring may have been due to thiscause. In the next generation this source of error was avoided, and manymore plants were raised, and now the average height of the twenty-threecrossed plants was to that of the twenty-three self-fertilised plants as100 to 91. We can therefore hardly doubt that a cross is beneficial tothis species.3. Petunia violacea (third generation).Eight crossed plants were to eight self-fertilised of the thirdgeneration in average height as 100 to 131; and at an early age thecrossed were inferior even in a still higher degree. But it is aremarkable fact that in one pot in which plants of both lots grewextremely crowded, the crossed were thrice as tall as theself-fertilised. As in the two preceding and two succeeding generations,as well as with plants raised by a crossed with a fresh stock, thecrossed greatly exceeded the self-fertilised in height, weight, andfertility (when these two latter points were attended to), the presentcase must be looked at as an anomaly not affecting the general rule. Themost probable explanation is that the seeds from which the crossedplants of the third generation were raised were not well ripened; for Ihave observed an analogous case with Iberis. Self-fertilised seedlingsof this latter plant, which were known to have been produced from seedsnot well matured, grew from the first much more quickly than the crossedplants, which were raised from better matured seeds; so that having thusonce got a great start they were enabled ever afterwards to retain theiradvantage. Some of these same seeds of the Iberis were sown on theopposite sides of pots filled with burnt earth and pure sand, notcontaining any organic matter; and now the young crossed seedlings grewduring their short life to double the height of the self-fertilised, inthe same manner as occurred with the above two sets of seedlings ofPetunia which were much crowded and thus exposed to very unfavourableconditions. We have seen also in the eighth generation of Ipomoea thatthe self-fertilised seedlings raised from unhealthy parents grew atfirst very much more quickly than the crossed seedlings, so that theywere for a long time much taller, though ultimately beaten by them.4, 5, 6. Eschscholtzia californica.Four sets of measurements are given in Table 7/A. In one of these thecrossed plants exceed the self-fertilised in average height, so thatthis is not one of the exceptions here to be considered. In two othercases the crossed equalled the self-fertilised in height within five percent; and in the fourth case the self-fertilised exceeded the crossed byabove this limit. We have seen in Table 7/C that the whole advantage ofa cross by a fresh stock is confined to fertility, and so it was withthe intercrossed plants of the same stock compared with theself-fertilised, for the former were in fertility to the latter as 100to 89. The intercrossed plants thus have at least one importantadvantage over the self-fertilised. Moreover, the flowers on theparent-plants when fertilised with pollen from another individual of thesame stock yield far more seeds than when self-fertilised; the flowersin this latter case being often quite sterile. We may therefore concludethat a cross does some good, though it does not give to the crossedseedlings increased powers of growth.7. Viscaria oculata.The average height of the fifteen intercrossed plants to that of thefifteen self-fertilised plants was only as 100 to 97; but the formerproduced many more capsules than the latter, in the ratio of 100 to 77.Moreover, the flowers on the parent-plants which were crossed andself-fertilised, yielded seeds on one occasion in the proportion of 100to 38, and on a second occasion in the proportion of 100 to 58. So thatthere can be no doubt about the beneficial effects of a cross, althoughthe mean height of the crossed plants was only three per cent above thatof the self-fertilised plants.8. Specularia speculum.Only the four tallest of the crossed and the four tallest of theself-fertilised plants, growing in four pots, were measured; and theformer were to the latter in height as 100 to 98. In all four pots acrossed plant flowered before any one of the self-fertilised plants, andthis is usually a safe indication of some real superiority in thecrossed plants. The flowers on the parent-plants which were crossed withpollen from another plant yielded seeds compared with theself-fertilised flowers in the ratio of 100 to 72. We may therefore drawthe same conclusion as in the last case with respect to a cross beingdecidedly beneficial.9. Borago officinalis.Only four crossed and four self-fertilised plants were raised andmeasured, and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 102. Sosmall a number of measurements ought never to be trusted; and in thepresent instance the advantage of the self-fertilised over the crossedplants depended almost entirely on one of the self-fertilised plantshaving grown to an unusual height. All four crossed plants floweredbefore their self-fertilised opponents. The cross-fertilised flowers onthe parent-plants in comparison with the self-fertilised flowers yieldedseeds in the proportion of 100 to 60. So that here again we may draw thesame conclusion as in the two last cases.10. Passiflora gracilis.Only two crossed and two self-fertilised plants were raised; and theformer were to the latter in height as 100 to 104. On the other hand,fruits from the cross-fertilised flowers on the parent-plants containedseeds in number, compared with those from the self-fertilised flowers,in the proportion of 100 to 85.11. Phaseolus multiflorus.The five crossed plants were to the five self-fertilised in height as100 to 96. Although the crossed plants were thus only four per centtaller than the self-fertilised, they flowered in both pots before them.It is therefore probable that they had some real advantage over theself-fertilised plants.12. Adonis aestivalis.The four crossed plants were almost exactly equal in height to the fourself-fertilised plants, but as so few plants were measured, and as thesewere all "miserably unhealthy," nothing can be inferred with safety withrespect to their relative heights.13. Bartonia aurea.The eight crossed plants were to the eight self-fertilised in height as100 to 107. This number of plants, considering the care with which theywere raised and compared, ought to have given a trustworthy result. Butfrom some unknown cause they grew very unequally, and they became sounhealthy that only three of the crossed and three of theself-fertilised plants set any seeds, and these few in number. Underthese circumstances the mean height of neither lot can be trusted, andthe experiment is valueless. The cross-fertilised flowers on theparent-plants yielded rather more seeds than the self-fertilisedflowers.14. Thunbergia alata.The six crossed plants were to the six self-fertilised in height as 100to 108. Here the self-fertilised plants seem to have a decidedadvantage; but both lots grew unequally, some of the plants in bothbeing more than twice as tall as others. The parent-plants also were inan odd semi-sterile condition. Under these circumstances the superiorityof the self-fertilised plants cannot be fully trusted.15. Nolana prostrata.The five crossed plants were to the five self-fertilised in height as100 to 105; so that the latter seem here to have a small but decidedadvantage. On the other hand, the flowers on the parent-plants whichwere cross-fertilised produced very many more capsules than theself-fertilised flowers, in the ratio of 100 to 21; and the seeds whichthe former contained were heavier than an equal number from theself-fertilised capsules in the ratio of 100 to 82.16. Hibiscus africanus.Only four pairs were raised, and the crossed were to the self-fertilisedin height as 100 to 109. Excepting that too few plants were measured, Iknow of nothing else to cause distrust in the result. Thecross-fertilised flowers on the parent-plants were, on the other hand,rather more productive than the self-fertilised flowers.17. Apium petroselinum.A few plants (number not recorded) derived from flowers believed to havebeen crossed by insects and a few self-fertilised plants were grown onthe opposite sides of four pots. They attained to a nearly equal height,the crossed having a very slight advantage.18. Vandellia nummularifolia.Twenty crossed plants raised from the seeds of perfect flowers were totwenty self-fertilised plants, likewise raised from the seeds of perfectflowers, in height as 100 to 99. The experiment was repeated, with thesole difference that the plants were allowed to grow more crowded; andnow the twenty-four tallest of the crossed plants were to thetwenty-four tallest self-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 94, andin weight as 100 to 97. Moreover, a larger number of the crossed than ofthe self-fertilised plants grew to a moderate height. Theabove-mentioned twenty crossed plants were also grown in competitionwith twenty self-fertilised plants raised from the closed or cleistogeneflowers, and their heights were as 100 to 94. Therefore had it not beenfor the first trial, in which the crossed plants were to theself-fertilised in height only as 100 to 99, this species might havebeen classed with those in which the crossed plants exceed theself-fertilised by above five per cent. On the other hand, the crossedplants in the second trial bore fewer capsules; and these containedfewer seeds, than did the self-fertilised plants, all the capsuleshaving been produced by cleistogene flowers. The whole case thereforemust be left doubtful.19. Pisum sativum (common pea).Four-plants derived from a cross between individuals of the same varietywere in height to four self-fertilised plants belonging to the samevariety as 100 to 115. Although this cross did no good, we have seenunder Table 7/C that a cross between distinct varieties adds greatly tothe height and vigour of the offspring; and it was there explained thatthe fact of a cross between the individuals of the same variety notbeing beneficial, is almost certainly due to their having beenself-fertilised for many generations, and in each generation grown undernearly similar conditions.20, 21, 22. Canna warscewiczi.Plants belonging to three generations were observed, and in all of threethe crossed were approximately equal to the self-fertilised; the averageheight of the thirty-four crossed plants being to that of the samenumber of self-fertilised plants as 100 to 101. Therefore the crossedplants had no advantage over the self-fertilised; and it is probablethat the same explanation here holds good as in the case of Pisumsativum; for the flowers of this Canna are perfectly self-fertile, andwere never seen to be visited by insects in the hothouse, so as to becrossed by them. This plant, moreover, has been cultivated under glassfor several generations in pots, and therefore under nearly uniformconditions. The capsules produced by the cross-fertilised flowers on theabove thirty-four crossed plants contained more seeds than did thecapsules produced by the self-fertilised flowers on the self-fertilisedplants, in the proportion of 100 to 85; so that in this respect crossingwas beneficial.23. Primula sinensis.The offspring of plants, some of which were legitimately and othersillegitimately fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant, were almostexactly of the same height as the offspring of self-fertilised plants;but the former with rare exceptions flowered before the latter. I haveshown in my paper on dimorphic plants that this species is commonlyraised in England from self-fertilised seed, and the plants from havingbeen cultivated in pots have been subjected to nearly uniformconditions. Moreover, many of them are now varying and changing theircharacter, so as to become in a greater or less degree equal-styled, andin consequence highly self-fertile. Therefore I believe that the causeof the crossed plants not exceeding in height the self-fertilised is thesame as in the two previous cases of Pisum sativum and Canna.24, 25, 26. Nicotiana tabacum.Four sets of measurements were made; in one, the self-fertilised plantsgreatly exceeded in height the crossed, in two others they wereapproximately equal to the crossed, and in the fourth were beaten bythem; but this latter case does not here concern us. The individualplants differ in constitution, so that the descendants of some profit bytheir parents having been intercrossed, whilst others do not. Taking allthree generations together, the twenty-seven crossed plants were inheight to the twenty-seven self-fertilised plants as 100 to 96. Thisexcess of height in the crossed plants, is so small compared with thatdisplayed by the offspring from the same mother-plants when crossed by aslightly different variety, that we may suspect (as explained underTable 7/C) that most of the individuals belonging to the variety whichserved as the mother-plants in my experiments, had acquired a nearlysimilar constitution, so as not to profit by being mutuallyintercrossed.]Reviewing these twenty-six cases, in which the crossed plants either donot exceed the self-fertilised by above five per cent in height, or areinferior to them, we may conclude that much the greater number of thecases do not form real exceptions to the rule,--that a cross between twoplants, unless these have been self-fertilised and exposed to nearly thesame conditions for many generations, gives a great advantage of somekind to the offspring. Of the twenty-six cases, at least two, namely,those of Adonis and Bartonia, may be wholly excluded, as the trials wereworthless from the extreme unhealthiness of the plants. Inn twelve othercases (three trials with Eschscholtzia here included) the crossed plantseither were superior in height to the self-fertilised in all the othergenerations excepting the one in question, or they showed theirsuperiority in some different manner, as in weight, fertility, or inflowering first; or again, the cross-fertilised flowers on themother-plant were much more productive of seed than the self-fertilised.Deducting these fourteen cases, there remain twelve in which the crossedplants show no well-marked advantage over the self-fertilised. On theother hand, we have seen that there are fifty-seven cases in which thecrossed plants exceed the self-fertilised in height by at least five percent, and generally in a much higher degree. But even in the twelvecases just referred to, the want of any advantage on the crossed side isfar from certain: with Thunbergia the parent-plants were in an oddsemi-sterile condition, and the offspring grew very unequally; withHibiscus and Apium much too few plants were raised for the measurementsto be trusted, and the cross-fertilised flowers of Hibiscus producedrather more seed than did the self-fertilised; with Vandellia thecrossed plants were a little taller and heavier than theself-fertilised, but as they were less fertile the case must be leftdoubtful. Lastly, with Pisum, Primula, the three generations of Canna,and the three of Nicotiana (which together complete the twelve cases), across between two plants certainly did no good or very little good tothe offspring; but we have reason to believe that this is the result ofthese plants having been self-fertilised and cultivated under nearlyuniform conditions for several generations. The same result followedwith the experimental plants of Ipomoea and Mimulus, and to a certainextent with some other species, which had been intentionally treated byme in this manner; yet we know that these species in their normalcondition profit greatly by being intercrossed. There is, therefore, nota single case in Table 7/A which affords decisive evidence against therule that a cross between plants, the progenitors of which have beensubjected to somewhat diversified conditions, is beneficial to theoffspring. This is a surprising conclusion, for from the analogy ofdomesticated animals it could not have been anticipated, that the goodeffects of crossing or the evil effects of self-fertilisation would havebeen perceptible until the plants had been thus treated for severalgenerations.The results given in Table 7/A may be looked at under another point ofview. Hitherto each generation has been considered as a separate case,of which there are eighty-three; and this no doubt is the more correctmethod of comparing the crossed and self-fertilised plants.But in those cases in which plants of the same species were observedduring several generations, a general average of their heights in allthe generations together may be made; and such averages are given inTable 7/A; for instance, under Ipomoea the general average for theplants of all ten generations is as 100 for the crossed, to 77 for theself-fertilised plants. This having been done in each case in which morethan one generation was raised, it is easy to calculate the average ofthe average heights of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of all thespecies included in Table 7/A. It should however be observed that asonly a few plants of some species, whilst a considerable number ofothers, were measured, the value of the mean or average heights of theseveral species is very different. Subject to this source of error, itmay be worth while to give the mean of the mean heights of thefifty-four species in Table 7/A; and the result is, calling the mean ofthe mean heights of the crossed plants 100, that of the self-fertilisedplants is 87. But it is a better plan to divide the fifty-four speciesinto three groups, as was done with the previously given eighty-threecases. The first group consists of species of which the mean heights ofthe self-fertilised plants are within five per cent of 100; so that thecrossed and self-fertilised plants are approximately equal; and of suchspecies there are twelve about which nothing need be said, the mean ofthe mean heights of the self-fertilised being of course very nearly 100,or exactly 99.58. The second group consists of the species, thirty-sevenin number, of which the mean heights of the crossed plants exceed thatof the self-fertilised plants by more than five per cent; and the meanof their mean heights is to that of the self-fertilised plants as 100 to78. The third group consists of the species, only five in number, ofwhich the mean heights of the self-fertilised plants exceed that of thecrossed by more than five per cent; and here the mean of the meanheights of the crossed plants is to that of the self-fertilised as 100to 109. Therefore if we exclude the species which are approximatelyequal, there are thirty-seven species in which the mean of the meanheights of the crossed plants exceeds that of the self-fertilised bytwenty-two per cent; whereas there are only five species in which themean of the mean heights of the self-fertilised plants exceeds that ofthe crossed, and this only by nine per cent.The truth of the conclusion--that the good effects of a cross depend onthe plants having been subjected to different conditions or to theirbelonging to different varieties, in both of which cases they wouldalmost certainly differ somewhat in constitution--is supported by acomparison of the Tables 7/A and 7/C. The latter table gives the resultsof crossing plants with a fresh stock or with a distinct variety; andthe superiority of the crossed offspring over the self-fertilised ishere much more general and much more strongly marked than in Table 7/A,in which plants of the same stock were crossed. We have just seen thatthe mean of the mean heights of the crossed plants of the wholefifty-four species in Table 7/A is to that of the self-fertilised plantsas 100 to 87; whereas the mean of the mean heights of the plants crossedby a fresh stock is to that of the self-fertilised in Table 7/C as 100to 74. So that the crossed plants beat the self-fertilised plants bythirteen per cent in Table 7/A, and by twenty-six per cent, or double asmuch, in Table 7/C, which includes the results of the cross by a freshstock.TABLE 7/B.A few words must be added on the weights of the crossed plants of thesame stock, in comparison with the self-fertilised. Eleven cases aregiven in Table 7/B, relating to eight species. The number of plantswhich were weighed is shown in the two left columns, and their relativeweights in the right column, that of the crossed plants being taken as100. A few other cases have already been recorded in Table 7/C inreference to plants crossed by a fresh stock. I regret that more trialsof this kind were not made, as the evidence of the superiority of thecrossed over the self-fertilised plants is thus shown in a moreconclusive manner than by their relative heights. But this plan was notthought of until a rather late period, and there were difficultieseither way, as the seeds had to be collected when ripe, by which timethe plants had often begun to wither. In only one out of the elevencases in Table 7/B, that of Eschscholtzia, do the self-fertilised plantsexceed the crossed in weight; and we have already seen they are likewisesuperior to them in height, though inferior in fertility, the wholeadvantage of a cross being here confined to the reproductive system.With Vandellia the crossed plants were a little heavier, as they werealso a little taller than the self-fertilised; but as a greater numberof more productive capsules were produced by the cleistogene flowers onthe self-fertilised plants than by those on the crossed plants, the casemust be left, as remarked under Table 7/A, altogether doubtful. Thecrossed and self-fertilised offspring from a partially self-sterileplant of Reseda odorata were almost equal in weight, though not inheight. In the remaining eight cases, the crossed plants show awonderful superiority over the self-fertilised, being more than doubletheir weight, except in one case, and here the ratio is as high as 100to 67. The results thus deduced from the weights of the plants confirmin a striking manner the former evidence of the beneficial effects of across between two plants of the same stock; and in the few cases inwhich plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock were weighed, theresults are similar or even more striking.CHAPTER VIII.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS IN CONSTITUTIONALVIGOUR AND IN OTHER RESPECTS.Greater constitutional vigour of crossed plants.The effects of great crowding.Competition with other kinds of plants.Self-fertilised plants more liable to premature death.Crossed plants generally flower before the self-fertilised.Negative effects of intercrossing flowers on the same plant.Cases described.Transmission of the good effects of a cross to later generations.Effects of crossing plants of closely related parentage.Uniform colour of the flowers on plants self-fertilised during severalgenerations and cultivated under similar conditions.GREATER CONSTITUTIONAL VIGOUR OF CROSSED PLANTS.As in almost all my experiments an equal number of crossed andself-fertilised seeds, or more commonly seedlings just beginning tosprout, were planted on the opposite sides of the same pots, they had tocompete with one another; and the greater height, weight, and fertilityof the crossed plants may be attributed to their possessing greaterinnate constitutional vigour. Generally the plants of the two lotswhilst very young were of equal height; but afterwards the crossedgained insensibly on their opponents, and this shows that they possessedsome inherent superiority, though not displayed at a very early periodin life. There were, however, some conspicuous exceptions to the rule ofthe two lots being at first equal in height; thus the crossed seedlingsof the broom (Sarothamnus scoparius) when under three inches in heightwere more than twice as tall as the self-fertilised plants.After the crossed or the self-fertilised plants had once grown decidedlytaller than their opponents, a still increasing advantage would tend tofollow from the stronger plants robbing the weaker ones of nourishmentand overshadowing them. This was evidently the case with the crossedplants of Viola tricolor, which ultimately quite overwhelmed theself-fertilised. But that the crossed plants have an inherentsuperiority, independently of competition, was sometimes well shown whenboth lots were planted separately, not far distant from one another, ingood soil in the open ground. This was likewise shown in several cases,even with plants growing in close competition with one another, by oneof the self-fertilised plants exceeding for a time its crossed opponent,which had been injured by some accident or was at first sickly, butbeing ultimately conquered by it. The plants of the eighth generation ofIpomoea were raised from small seeds produced by unhealthy parents, andthe self-fertilised plants grew at first very rapidly, so that when theplants of both lots were about three feet in height, the mean height ofthe crossed to that of the self-fertilised was as 100 to 122; when theywere about six feet high the two lots were very nearly equal, butultimately when between eight and nine feet in height, the crossedplants asserted their usually superiority, and were to theself-fertilised in height as 100 to 85.The constitutional superiority of the crossed over the self-fertilisedplants was proved in another way in the third generation of Mimulus, byself-fertilised seeds being sown on one side of a pot, and after acertain interval of time crossed seeds on the opposite side. Theself-fertilised seedlings thus had (for I ascertained that the seedsgerminated simultaneously) a clear advantage over the crossed in thestart for the race. Nevertheless they were easily beaten (as may be seenunder the head of Mimulus) when the crossed seeds were sown two wholedays after the self-fertilised. But when the interval was four days, thetwo lots were nearly equal throughout life. Even in this latter case thecrossed plants still possessed an inherent advantage, for after bothlots had grown to their full height they were cut down, and withoutbeing disturbed were transferred to a larger pot, and when in theensuing year they had again grown to their full height they weremeasured; and now the tallest crossed plants were to the tallestself-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 75, and in fertility (i.e.,by weight of seeds produced by an equal number of capsules from bothlots) as 100 to 34.My usual method of proceeding, namely, to plant several pairs of crossedand self-fertilised seeds in an equal state of germination on theopposite sides of the same pots, so that the plants were subjected tomoderately severe mutual competition, was I think the best that couldhave been followed, and was a fair test of what occurs in a state ofnature. For plants sown by nature generally come up crowded, and arealmost always exposed to very severe competition with one another andwith other kinds of plants. This latter consideration led me to makesome trials, chiefly but not exclusively with Ipomoea and Mimulus, bysowing crossed and self-fertilised seeds on the opposite sides of largepots in which other plants had long been growing, or in the midst ofother plants out of doors. The seedlings were thus subjected to verysevere competition with plants of other kinds; and in all such cases,the crossed seedlings exhibited a great superiority in their power ofgrowth over the self-fertilised.After the germinating seedlings had been planted in pairs on theopposite sides of several pots, the remaining seeds, whether or not in astate of germination, were in most cases sown very thickly on the twosides of an additional large pot; so that the seedlings came upextremely crowded, and were subjected to extremely severe competitionand unfavourable conditions. In such cases the crossed plants almostinvariably showed a greater superiority over the self-fertilised, thandid the plants which grew in pairs in the pots.Sometimes crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sown in separate rowsin the open ground, which was kept clear of weeds; so that the seedlingswere not subjected to any competition with other kinds of plants. Thosehowever in each row had to struggle with the adjoining ones in the samerow. When fully grown, several of the tallest plants in each row wereselected, measured, and compared. The result was in several cases (butnot so invariably as might have been expected) that the crossed plantsdid not exceed in height the self-fertilised in nearly so great a degreeas when grown in pairs in the pots. Thus with the plants of Digitalis,which competed together in pots, the crossed were to the self-fertilisedin height as 100 to 70; whilst those which were grown separately wereonly as 100 to 85. Nearly the same result was observed with Brassica.With Nicotiana the crossed were to the self-fertilised plants in height,when grown extremely crowded together in pots, as 100 to 54; when grownmuch less crowded in pots as 100 to 66, and when grow in the openground, so as to be subjected to but little competition, as 100 to 72.On the other hand with Zea, there was a greater difference in heightbetween the crossed and self-fertilised plants growing out of doors,than between the pairs which grew in pots in the hothouse; but this maybe attributed to the self-fertilised plants being more tender, so thatthey suffered more than the crossed, when both lots were exposed to acold and wet summer. Lastly, with one out of two series of Resedaodorata, grown out of doors in rows, as well as with Beta vulgaris, thecrossed plants did not at all exceed the self-fertilised in height, orexceeded them by a mere trifle.The innate power of the crossed plants to resist unfavourable conditionsfar better than did the self-fertilised plants, was shown on twooccasions in a curious manner, namely, with Iberis and in the thirdgeneration of Petunia, by the great superiority in height of the crossedover the self-fertilised seedlings, when both sets were grown underextremely unfavourable conditions; whereas owing to specialcircumstances exactly the reverse occurred with the plants raised fromthe same seeds and grown in pairs in pots. A nearly analogous case wasobserved on two other occasions with plants of the first generation ofNicotiana.The crossed plants always withstood the injurious effects of beingsuddenly removed into the open air after having been kept in thegreenhouse better than did the self-fertilised. On several occasionsthey also resisted much better cold and intemperate weather. This wasmanifestly the case with some crossed and self-fertilised plants ofIpomoea, which were suddenly moved from the hothouse to the coldest partof a cool greenhouse. The offspring of plants of the eighthself-fertilised generation of Mimulus crossed by a fresh stock, surviveda frost which killed every single self-fertilised and intercrossed plantof the same old stock. Nearly the same result followed with some crossedand self-fertilised plants of Viola tricolor. Even the tips of theshoots of the crossed plants of Sarothamnus scoparius were not touchedby a very severe winter; whereas all the self-fertilised plants werekilled halfway down to the ground, so that they were not able to flowerduring the next summer. Young crossed seedlings of Nicotiana withstood acold and wet summer much better than the self-fertilised seedlings. Ihave met with only one exception to the rule of crossed plants beinghardier than the self-fertilised: three long rows of Eschscholtziaplants, consisting of crossed seedlings from a fresh stock, ofintercrossed seedlings of the same stock, and of self-fertilised ones,were left unprotected during a severe winter, and all perished excepttwo of the self-fertilised. But this case is not so anomalous as it atfirst appears, for it should be remembered that the self-fertilisedplants of Eschscholtzia always grow taller and are heavier than thecrossed; the whole benefit of a cross with this species being confinedto increased fertility.Independently of any external cause which could be detected, theself-fertilised plants were more liable to premature death than were thecrossed; and this seems to me a curious fact. Whilst the seedlings werevery young, if one died its antagonist was pulled up and thrown away,and I believe that many more of the self-fertilised died at this earlyage than of the crossed; but I neglected to keep any record. With Betavulgaris, however, it is certain that a large number of theself-fertilised seeds perished after germinating beneath the ground,whereas the crossed seeds sown at the same time did not thus suffer.When a plant died at a somewhat more advanced age the fact was recorded;and I find in my notes that out of several hundred plants, only seven ofthe crossed died, whilst of the self-fertilised at least twenty-ninewere thus lost, that is more than four times as many. Mr. Galton, afterexamining some of my tables, remarks: "It is very evident that thecolumns with the self-fertilised plants include the larger number ofexceptionally small plants;" and the frequent presence of such punyplants no doubt stands in close relation with their liability topremature death. The self-fertilised plants of Petunia completed theirgrowth and began to wither sooner than did the intercrossed plants; andthese latter considerably before the offspring from a cross with a freshstock.PERIOD OF FLOWERING.In some cases, as with Digitalis, Dianthus, and Reseda, a larger numberof the crossed than of the self-fertilised plants threw up flower-stems;but this probably was merely the result of their greater power ofgrowth; for in the first generation of Lobelia fulgens, in which theself-fertilised plants greatly exceeded in height the crossed plants,some of the latter failed to throw up flower-stems. With a large numberof species, the crossed plants exhibited a well-marked tendency toflower before the self-fertilised ones growing in the same pots. Itshould however be remarked that no record was kept of the flowering ofmany of the species; and when a record was kept, the flowering of thefirst plant in each pot was alone observed, although two or more pairsgrew in the same pot. I will now give three lists,--one of the speciesin which the first plant that flowered was a crossed one,--a second inwhich the first that flowered was a self-fertilised plant,--and a thirdof those which flowered at the same time.[SPECIES, OF WHICH THE FIRST PLANTS THAT FLOWERED WERE OF CROSSEDPARENTAGE.Ipomoea purpurea.I record in my notes that in all ten generations many of the crossedplants flowered before the self-fertilised; but no details were kept.Mimulus luteus (First Generation).Ten flowers on the crossed plants were fully expanded before one on theself-fertilised.Mimulus luteus (Second and Third Generation).In both these generations a crossed plant flowered before one of theself-fertilised in all three pots.Mimulus luteus (Fifth Generation).In all three pots a crossed plant flowered first; yet theself-fertilised plants, which belonged to the new tall variety, were inheight to the crossed as 126 to 100.Mimulus luteus.Plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock as well as theintercrossed plants of the old stock, flowered before theself-fertilised plants in nine out of the ten pots.Salvia coccinea.A crossed plant flowered before any one of the self-fertilised in allthree pots.Origanum vulgare.During two successive seasons several crossed plants flowered before theself-fertilised.Brassica oleracea (First Generation).All the crossed plants growing in pots and in the open ground floweredfirst.Brassica oleracea (Second Generation).A crossed plant in three out of the four pots flowered before any one ofthe self-fertilised.Iberis umbellata.In both pots a crossed plant flowered first.Eschscholtzia californica.Plants derived from the Brazilian stock crossed by the English stockflowered in five out of the nine pots first;

yet in all three pots the self-fertilised plants flowered first.Clarkia elegans.Although the crossed plants were, as in the last case, to theself-fertilised in height as 100 to 82, yet in the two pots theself-fertilised flowered first.Lobelia fulgens (First Generation).The crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height only as 100 to127, and the latter flowered much before the crossed.Petunia violacea (Third Generation).The crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 131,and in three out of the four pots a self-fertilised plant floweredfirst; in the fourth pot simultaneously.Petunia violacea (Fourth generation).Although the crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100to 69, yet in three out of the five pots a self-fertilised plantflowered first; in the fourth pot simultaneously, and only in the fifthdid a crossed plant flower first.Nicotiana tabacum (First Generation).The crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height only as 100 to178, and a self-fertilised plant flowered first in all four pots.Nicotiana tabacum (Third Generation).The crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 101,and in four out of the five pots a self-fertilised plant flowered first.Canna warscewiczi.In the three generations taken together the crossed were to theself-fertilised in height as 100 to 101; in the first generation theself-fertilised plants showed some tendency to flower first, and in thethird generation they flowered first in nine out of the twelve pots.SPECIES IN WHICH THE CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS FLOWERED ALMOSTSIMULTANEOUSLY.Mimulus luteus (Sixth Generation).The crossed plants were inferior in height and vigour to theself-fertilised plants, which all belonged to the new white-floweredtall variety, yet in only half the pots did the self-fertilised plantsflower first, and in the other half the crossed plants.Viscaria oculata.The crossed plants were only a little taller than the self-fertilised(namely, as 100 to 97), but considerably more fertile, yet both lotsflowered almost simultaneously.Lathyrus odoratus (Second Generation).Although the crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100to 88, yet there was no marked difference in their period of flowering.Lobelia fulgens (Second Generation).Although the crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100to 91, yet they flowered simultaneously.Nicotiana tabacum (Third Generation).Although the crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height as 100to 83, yet in half the pots a self-fertilised plant flowered first, andin the other half a crossed plant.]These three lists include fifty-eight cases, in which the period offlowering of the crossed and self-fertilised plants was recorded. Inforty-four of them a crossed plant flowered first either in a majorityof the pots or in all; in nine instances a self-fertilised plantflowered first, and in five the two lots flowered simultaneously. One ofthe most striking cases is that of Cyclamen, in which the crossed plantsflowered some weeks before the self-fertilised in all four pots duringtwo seasons. In the second generation of Lobelia ramosa, a crossed plantflowered in all four pots some days before any one of theself-fertilised. Plants derived from a cross with a fresh stockgenerally showed a very strongly marked tendency to flower before theself-fertilised and the intercrossed plants of the old stock; all threelots growing in the same pots. Thus with Mimulus and Dianthus, in onlyone pot out of ten, and in Nicotiana in only one pot out of sixteen, dida self-fertilised plant flower before the plants of the two crossedkinds,--these latter flowering almost simultaneously.A consideration of the two first lists, especially of the second one,shows that a tendency to flower first is generally connected withgreater power of growth, that is, with greater height. But there aresome remarkable exceptions to this rule, proving that some other causecomes into play. Thus the crossed plants both of Lupinus luteus andClarkia elegans were to the self-fertilised plants in height as 100 to82, and yet the latter flowered first. In the third generation ofNicotiana, and in all three generations of Canna, the crossed andself-fertilised plants were of nearly equal height, yet theself-fertilised tended to flower first. On the other hand, with Primulasinensis, plants raised from a cross between two distinct individuals,whether these were legitimately or illegitimately crossed, floweredbefore the illegitimately self-fertilised plants, although all theplants were of nearly equal height in both cases. So it was with respectto height and flowering with Phaseolus, Specularia, and Borago. Thecrossed plants of Hibiscus were inferior in height to theself-fertilised, in the ratio of 100 to 109, and yet they floweredbefore the self-fertilised in three out of the four pots. On the whole,there can be no doubt that the crossed plants exhibit a tendency toflower before the self-fertilised, almost though not quite so stronglymarked as to grow to a greater height, to weigh more, and to be morefertile.A few other cases not included in the above three lists deserve notice.In all three pots of Viola tricolor, naturally crossed plants theoffspring of crossed plants flowered before naturally crossed plants theoffspring of self-fertilised plants. Flowers on two plants, both ofself-fertilised parentage, of the sixth generation of Mimulus luteuswere intercrossed, and other flowers on the same plants were fertilisedwith their own pollen; intercrossed seedlings and seedlings of theseventh self-fertilised generation were thus raised, and the latterflowered before the intercrossed in three out of the five pots. Flowerson a plant both of Mimulus luteus and of Ipomoea purpurea were crossedwith pollen from other flowers on the same plant, and other flowers werefertilised with their own pollen; intercrossed seedlings of thispeculiar kind, and others strictly self-fertilised being thus raised. Inthe case of the Mimulus the self-fertilised plants flowered first inseven out of the eight pots, and in the case of the Ipomoea in eight outof the ten pots; so that an intercross between the flowers on the sameplant was very far from giving to the offspring thus raised, anyadvantage over the strictly self-fertilised plants in their period offlowering.EFFECTS OF CROSSING FLOWERS ON THE SAME PLANT.In the discussion on the results of a cross with a fresh stock, givenunder Table 7/C in the last chapter, it was shown that the mere act ofcrossing by itself does no good; but that the advantages thus deriveddepend on the plants which are crossed, either consisting of distinctvarieties which will almost certainly differ somewhat in constitution,or on the progenitors of the plants which are crossed, though identicalin every external character, having been subjected to somewhat differentconditions and having thus acquired some slight difference inconstitution. All the flowers produced by the same plant have beendeveloped from the same seed; those which expand at the same time havebeen exposed to exactly the same climatic influences; and the stems haveall been nourished by the same roots. Therefore in accordance with theconclusion just referred to, no good ought to result from crossingflowers on the same plant. (8/1. It is, however, possible that thestamens which differ in length or construction in the same flower mayproduce pollen differing in nature, and in this manner a cross might bemade effective between the several flowers on the same plant. Mr. Macnabstates in a communication to M. Verlot 'La Production des Varietes' 1865page 42, that seedlings raised from the shorter and longer stamens ofrhododendron differ in character; but the shorter stamens apparently arebecoming rudimentary, and the seedlings are dwarfs, so that the resultmay be simply due to a want of fertilising power in the pollen, as inthe case of the dwarfed plants of Mirabilis raised by Naudin by the useof too few pollen-grains. Analogous statements have been made withrespect to the stamens of Pelargonium. With some of the Melastomaceae,seedlings raised by me from flowers fertilised by pollen from theshorter stamens, certainly differed in appearance from those raised fromthe longer stamens, with differently coloured anthers; but here, again,there is some reason for believing that the shorter stamens are tendingtowards abortion. In the very different case of trimorphic heterostyledplants, the two sets of stamens in the same flower have widely differentfertilising powers.) In opposition to this conclusion is the fact that abud is in one sense a distinct individual, and is capable ofoccasionally or even not rarely assuming new external characters, aswell as new constitutional peculiarities. Plants raised from buds whichhave thus varied may be propagated for a great length of time by grafts,cuttings, etc., and sometimes even by seminal generation. (8/2. I havegiven numerous cases of such bud-variations in my 'Variation of Animalsand Plants under Domestication' chapter 11 2nd edition volume 1 page448.) There exist also numerous species in which the flowers on the sameplant differ from one another,--as in the sexual organs of monoeciousand polygamous plants,--in the structure of the circumferential flowersin many Compositae, Umbelliferae, etc.,--in the structure of the centralflower in some plants,--in the two kinds of flowers produced bycleistogene species,--and in several other such cases. These instancesclearly prove that the flowers on the same plant have often variedindependently of one another in many important respects, such variationshaving been fixed, like those on distinct plants during the developmentof species.It was therefore necessary to ascertain by experiment what would be theeffect of intercrossing flowers on the same plant, in comparison withfertilising them with their own pollen or crossing them with pollen froma distinct plant. Trials were carefully made on five genera belonging tofour families; and in only one case, namely, Digitalis, did theoffspring from a cross between the flowers on the same plant receive anybenefit, and the benefit here was small compared with that derived froma cross between distinct plants. In the chapter on Fertility, when weconsider the effects of cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation onthe productiveness of the parent-plants we shall arrive at nearly thesame result, namely, that a cross between the flowers on the same plantdoes not at all increase the number of the seeds, or only occasionallyand to a slight degree. I will now give an abstract of the results ofthe five trials which were made.1. Digitalis purpurea.Seedlings raised from intercrossed flowers on the same plant, and othersfrom flowers fertilised with their own pollen, were grown in the usualmanner in competition with one another on the opposite sides of tenpots. In this and the four following cases, the details may be foundunder the head of each species. In eight pots, in which the plants didnot grow much crowded, the flower-stems on sixteen intercrossed plantswere in height to those on sixteen self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 94.In the two other pots on which the plants grew much crowded, theflower-stems on nine intercrossed plants were in height to those on nineself-fertilised plants, as 100 to 90. That the intercrossed plants inthese two latter pots had a real advantage over their self-fertilisedopponents, was well shown by their relative weights when cut down, whichwas as 100 to 78. The mean height of the flower-stems on the twenty-fiveintercrossed plants in the ten pots taken together, was to that of theflower-stems on the twenty-five self-fertilised plants, as 100 to 92.Thus the intercrossed plants were certainly superior to theself-fertilised in some degree; but their superiority was small comparedwith that of the offspring from a cross between distinct plants over theself-fertilised, this being in the ratio of 100 to 70 in height. Nordoes this latter ratio show at all fairly the great superiority of theplants derived from a cross between distinct individuals over theself-fertilised, as the former produced more than twice as manyflower-stems as the latter, and were much less liable to prematuredeath.2. Ipomoea purpurea.Thirty-one intercrossed plants raised from a cross between flowers onthe same plants were grown in ten pots in competition with the samenumber of self-fertilised plants, and the former were to the latter inheight as 100 to 105. So that the self-fertilised plants were a littletaller than the intercrossed; and in eight out of the ten pots aself-fertilised plant flowered before any one of the crossed plants inthe same pots. The plants which were not greatly crowded in nine of thepots (and these offer the fairest standard of comparison) were cut downand weighed; and the weight of the twenty-seven intercrossed plants wasto that of the twenty-seven self-fertilised as 100 to 124; so that bythis test the superiority of the self-fertilised was strongly marked. Tothis subject of the superiority of the self-fertilised plants in certaincases, I shall have to recur in a future chapter. If we now turn to theoffspring from a cross between distinct plants when put into competitionwith self-fertilised plants, we find that the mean height ofseventy-three such crossed plants, in the course of ten generations, wasto that of the same number of self-fertilised plants as 100 to 77; andin the case of the plants of the tenth generation in weight as 100 to44. Thus the contrast between the effects of crossing flowers on thesame plant, and of crossing flowers on distinct plants, is wonderfullygreat.3. Mimulus luteus.Twenty-two plants raised by crossing flowers on the same plant weregrown in competition with the same number of self-fertilised plants; andthe former were to the latter in height as 100 to 105, and in weight as100 to 103. Moreover, in seven out of the eight pots a self-fertilisedplant flowered before any of the intercrossed plants. So that here againthe self-fertilised exhibit a slight superiority over the intercrossedplants. For the sake of comparison, I may add that seedlings raisedduring three generations from a cross between distinct plants were tothe self-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 65.4. Pelargonium zonale.Two plants growing in separate pots, which had been propagated bycuttings from the same plant, and therefore formed in fact parts of thesame individual, were intercrossed, and other flowers on one of theseplants were self-fertilised; but the seedlings obtained by the twoprocesses did not differ in height. When, on the other hand, flowers onone of the above plants were crossed with pollen taken from a distinctseedling, and other flowers were self-fertilised, the crossed offspringthus obtained were to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 74.5. Origanum vulgare.A plant which had been long cultivated in my kitchen garden, had spreadby stolons so as to form a large bed or clump. Seedlings raised byintercrossing flowers on these plants, which strictly consisted of thesame plant, and other seedlings raised from self-fertilised flowers,were carefully compared from their earliest youth to maturity; and theydid not differ at all in height or in constitutional vigour. Someflowers on these seedlings were then crossed with pollen taken from adistinct seedling, and other flowers were self-fertilised; two freshlots of seedlings being thus raised, which were the grandchildren of theplant that had spread by stolons and formed a large clump in my garden.These differed much in height, the crossed plants being to theself-fertilised as 100 to 86. They differed, also, to a wonderful degreein constitutional vigour. The crossed plants flowered first, andproduced exactly twice as many flower-stems; and they afterwardsincreased by stolons to such an extent as almost to overwhelm theself-fertilised plants.Reviewing these five cases, we see that in four of them, the effect of across between flowers on the same plant (even on offsets of the sameplant growing on separate roots, as with the Pelargonium and Origanum)does not differ from that of the strictest self-fertilisation. Indeed,in two of the cases the self-fertilised plants were superior to suchintercrossed plants. With Digitalis a cross between the flowers on thesame plant certainly did do some good, yet very slight compared withthat from a cross between distinct plants. On the whole the results herearrived at, if we bear in mind that the flower-buds are to a certainextent distinct individuals and occasionally vary independently of oneanother, agree well with our general conclusion, that the advantages ofa cross depend on the progenitors of the crossed plants possessingsomewhat different constitutions, either from having been exposed todifferent conditions, or to their having varied from unknown causes in amanner which we in our ignorance are forced to speak of as spontaneous.Hereafter I shall have to recur to this subject of the inefficiency of across between the flowers on the same plant, when we consider the partwhich insects play in the cross-fertilisation of flowers.ON THE TRANSMISSION OF THE GOOD EFFECTS FROM A CROSS AND OF THE EVILEFFECTS FROM SELF-FERTILISATION.We have seen that seedlings from a cross between distinct plants almostalways exceed their self-fertilised opponents in height, weight, andconstitutional vigour, and, as will hereafter be shown, often infertility. To ascertain whether this superiority would be transmittedbeyond the first generation, seedlings were raised on three occasionsfrom crossed and self-fertilised plants, both sets being fertilised inthe same manner, and therefore not as in the many cases given in Tables7/A, 7/B, 7/C, in which the crossed plants were again crossed and theself-fertilised again self-fertilised.Firstly, seedlings were raised from self-fertilised seeds produced undera net by crossed and self-fertilised plants of Nemophila insignis; andthe latter were to the former in height as 133 to 100. But theseseedlings became very unhealthy early in life, and grew so unequallythat some of them in both lots were five times as tall as the others.Therefore this experiment was quite worthless; but I have felt bound togive it, as opposed to my general conclusion. I should state that inthis and the two following trials, both sets of plants were grown on theopposite sides of the same pots, and treated in all respects alike. Thedetails of the experiments may be found under the head of each species.Secondly, a crossed and a self-fertilised plant of Heartsease (Violatricolor) grew near together in the open ground and near to other plantsof heartsease; and as both produced an abundance of very fine capsules,the flowers on both were certainly cross-fertilised by insects. Seedswere collected from both plants, and seedlings raised from them. Thosefrom the crossed plants flowered in all three pots before those from theself-fertilised plants; and when fully grown the former were to thelatter in height as 100 to 82. As both sets of plants were the productof cross-fertilisation, the difference in their growth and period offlowering was clearly due to their parents having been of crossed andself-fertilised parentage; and it is equally clear that they transmitteddifferent constitutional powers to their offspring, the grandchildren ofthe plants which were originally crossed and self-fertilised.Thirdly, the Sweet Pea (Lathyrus odoratus) habitually fertilises itselfin this country. As I possessed plants, the parents and grandparents ofwhich had been artificially crossed and other plants descended from thesame parents which had been self-fertilised for many previousgenerations, these two lots of plants were allowed to fertilisethemselves under a net, and their self-fertilised seeds saved. Theseedlings thus raised were grown in competition with each other in theusual manner, and differed in their powers of growth. Those from theself-fertilised plants which had been crossed during the two previousgenerations were to those from the plants self-fertilised during manyprevious generations in height as 100 to 90. These two lots of seedswere likewise tried by being sown under very unfavourable conditions inpoor exhausted soil, and the plants whose grandparents andgreat-grandparents had been crossed showed in an unmistakable mannertheir superior constitutional vigour. In this case, as in that of theheartsease, there could be no doubt that the advantage derived from across between two plants was not confined to the offspring of the firstgeneration. That constitutional vigour due to cross-parentage istransmitted for many generations may also be inferred as highlyprobable, from some of Andrew Knight's varieties of the common pea,which were raised by crossing distinct varieties, after which time theyno doubt fertilised themselves in each succeeding generation. Thesevarieties lasted for upwards of sixty years, "but their glory is nowdeparted." (8/3. See the evidence on this head in my 'Variation underDomestication' chapter 9 volume 1 2nd edition page 397.) On the otherhand, most of the varieties of the common pea, which there is no reasonto suppose owe their origin to a cross, have had a much shorterexistence. Some also of Mr. Laxton's varieties produced by artificialcrosses have retained their astonishing vigour and luxuriance for aconsiderable number of generations; but as Mr. Laxton informs me, hisexperience does not extend beyond twelve generations, within whichperiod he has never perceived any diminution of vigour in his plants.An allied point may be here noticed. As the force of inheritance isstrong with plants (of which abundant evidence could be given), it isalmost certain that seedlings from the same capsule or from the sameplant would tend to inherit nearly the same constitution; and as theadvantage from a cross depends on the plants which are crossed differingsomewhat in constitution, it may be inferred as probable that undersimilar conditions a cross between the nearest relations would notbenefit the offspring so much as one between non-related plants. Insupport of this conclusion we have some evidence, as Fritz Muller hasshown by his valuable experiments on hybrid Abutilons, that the union ofbrothers and sisters, parents and children, and of other near relationsis highly injurious to the fertility of the offspring. In one case,moreover, seedlings from such near relations possessed very weakconstitutions. (8/4. 'Jenaische Zeitschrift fur Naturw.' B. 7 pages 22and 45 1872 and 1873 pages 441-450.) This same observer also found threeplants of a Bignonia growing near together. (8/5. 'Botanische Zeitung'1868 page 626.) He fertilised twenty-nine flowers on one of them withtheir own pollen, and they did not set a single capsule. Thirty flowerswere then fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant, one of the threegrowing together, and they yielded only two capsules. Lastly, fiveflowers were fertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at adistance, and all five produced capsules. It seems therefore probable,as Fritz Muller suggests, that the three plants growing near togetherwere seedlings from the same parent, and that from being closely relatedthey had little power of fertilising one another. (8/6. Some remarkablecases are given in my 'Variation under Domestication' chapter 17 2ndedition volume 2 page 121, of hybrids of Gladiolus and Cistus, any oneof which could be fertilised by pollen from any other, but not by itsown pollen.)Lastly, the fact of the intercrossed plants in Table 7/A not exceedingin height the self-fertilised plants in a greater and greater degree inthe later generations, is probably the result of their having becomemore and more closely inter-related.UNIFORM COLOUR OF THE FLOWERS ON PLANTS, SELF-FERTILISED AND GROWN UNDERSIMILAR CONDITIONS FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS.At the commencement of my experiments, the parent-plants of Mimulusluteus, Ipomoea purpurea, Dianthus caryophyllus, and Petunia violacea,raised from purchased seeds, varied greatly in the colour of theirflowers. This occurs with many plants which have been long cultivated asan ornament for the flower-garden, and which have been propagated byseeds. The colour of the flowers was a point to which I did not at firstin the least attend, and no selection whatever was practised.Nevertheless, the flowers produced by the self-fertilised plants of theabove four species became absolutely uniform in tint, or very nearly so,after they had been grown for some generations under closely similarconditions. The intercrossed plants, which were more or less closelyinter-related in the later generations, and which had been likewisecultivated all the time under similar conditions, became more uniform inthe colour of their flowers than were the original parent-plants, butmuch less so than the self-fertilised plants. When self-fertilisedplants of one of the later generations were crossed with a fresh stock,and seedlings thus raised, these presented a wonderful contrast in thediversified tints of their flowers compared with those of theself-fertilised seedlings. As such cases of flowers becoming uniformlycoloured without any aid from selection seem to me curious, I will givea full abstract of my observations.Mimulus luteus.A tall variety, bearing large, almost white flowers blotched withcrimson, appeared amongst the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants ofthe third and fourth generations. This variety increased so rapidly,that in the sixth generation of self-fertilised plants every single oneconsisted of it. So it was with all the many plants which were raised,up to the last or ninth self-fertilised generation. Although thisvariety first appeared amongst the intercrossed plants, yet from theiroffspring being intercrossed in each succeeding generation, it neverprevailed amongst them; and the flowers on the several intercrossedplants of the ninth generation differed considerably in colour. On theother hand, the uniformity in colour of the flowers on the plants of allthe later self-fertilised generations was quite surprising; on a casualinspection they might have been said to be quite alike, but the crimsonblotches were not of exactly the same shape, or in exactly the sameposition. Both my gardener and myself believe that this variety did notappear amongst the parent-plants, raised from purchased seeds, but fromits appearance amongst both the crossed and self-fertilised plants ofthe third and fourth generations; and from what I have seen of thevariation of this species on other occasions, it is probable that itwould occasionally appear under any circumstances. We learn, however,from the present case that under the peculiar conditions to which myplants were subjected, this particular variety, remarkable for itscolouring, largeness of the corolla, and increased height of the wholeplant, prevailed in the sixth and all the succeeding self-fertilisedgenerations to the complete exclusion of every other variety.Ipomoea purpurea.My attention was first drawn to the present subject by observing thatthe flowers on all the plants of the seventh self-fertilised generationwere of a uniform, remarkably rich, dark purple tint. The many plantswhich were raised during the three succeeding generations, up to thelast or tenth, all produced flowers coloured in the same manner. Theywere absolutely uniform in tint, like those of a constant species livingin a state of nature; and the self-fertilised plants might have beendistinguished with certainty, as my gardener remarked, without the aidof labels, from the intercrossed plants of the later generations. These,however, had more uniformly coloured flowers than those which were firstraised from the purchased seeds. This dark purple variety did notappear, as far as my gardener and myself could recollect, before thefifth or sixth self-fertilised generation. However this may have been,it became, through continued self-fertilisation and the cultivation ofthe plants under uniform conditions, perfectly constant, to theexclusion of every other variety.Dianthus caryophyllus.The self-fertilised plants of the third generation all bore flowers ofexactly the same pale rose-colour; and in this respect they differedquite remarkably from the plants growing in a large bed close by andraised from seeds purchased from the same nursery garden. In this caseit is not improbable that some of the parent-plants which were firstself-fertilised may have borne flowers thus coloured; but as severalplants were self-fertilised in the first generation, it is extremelyimprobable that all bore flowers of exactly the same tint as those ofthe self-fertilised plants of the third generation. The intercrossedplants of the third generation likewise produced flowers almost, thoughnot quite so uniform in tint as those of the self-fertilised plants.Petunia violacea.In this case I happened to record in my notes that the flowers on theparent-plant which was first self-fertilised were of a "dingy purplecolour." In the fifth self-fertilised generation, every one of thetwenty-one self-fertilised plants growing in pots, and all the manyplants in a long row out of doors, produced flowers of absolutely thesame tint, namely, of a dull, rather peculiar and ugly flesh colour;therefore, considerably unlike those on the parent-plant. I believe thatthis change of colour supervened quite gradually; but I kept no record,as the point did not interest me until I was struck with the uniformtint of the flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the fifthgeneration. The flowers on the intercrossed plants of the correspondinggeneration were mostly of the same dull flesh colour, but not nearly souniform as those on the self-fertilised plants, some few being verypale, almost white. The self-fertilised plants which grew in a long rowin the open ground were also remarkable for their uniformity in height,as were the intercrossed plants in a less degree, both lots beingcompared with a large number of plants raised at the same time undersimilar conditions from the self-fertilised plants of the fourthgeneration crossed by a fresh stock. I regret that I did not attend tothe uniformity in height of the self-fertilised seedlings in the latergenerations of the other species.These few cases seem to me to possess much interest. We learn from themthat new and slight shades of colour may be quickly and firmly fixed,independently of any selection, if the conditions are kept as nearlyuniform as is possible, and no intercrossing be permitted. With Mimulus,not only a grotesque style of colouring, but a larger corolla andincreased height of the whole plant were thus fixed; whereas with mostplants which have been long cultivated for the flower-garden, nocharacter is more variable than that of colour, excepting perhaps thatof height. From the consideration of these cases we may infer that thevariability of cultivated plants in the above respects is due, firstly,to their being subjected to somewhat diversified conditions, and,secondly, to their being often intercrossed, as would follow from thefree access of insects. I do not see how this inference can be avoided,as when the above plants were cultivated for several generations underclosely similar conditions, and were intercrossed in each generation,the colour of their flowers tended in some degree to change and tobecome uniform. When no intercrossing with other plants of the samestock was allowed,--that is, when the flowers were fertilised with theirown pollen in each generation--their colour in the later generationsbecame as uniform as that of plants growing in a state of nature,accompanied at least in one instance by much uniformity in the height ofthe plants. But in saying that the diversified tints of the flowers oncultivated plants treated in the ordinary manner are due to differencesin the soil, climate, etc., to which they are exposed, I do not wish toimply that such variations are caused by these agencies in any moredirect manner than that in which the most diversified illnesses, ascolds, inflammation of the lungs or pleura, rheumatism, etc., may besaid to be caused by exposure to cold. In both cases the constitution ofthe being which is acted on is of preponderant importance.CHAPTER IX.THE EFFECTS OF CROSS-FERTILISATION AND SELF-FERTILISATION ON THEPRODUCTION OF SEEDS.Fertility of plants of crossed and self-fertilised parentage, both lotsbeing fertilised in the same manner.Fertility of the parent-plants when first crossed and self-fertilised,and of their crossed and self-fertilised offspring when again crossedand self-fertilised.Comparison of the fertility of flowers fertilised with their own pollenand with that from other flowers on the same plant.Self-sterile plants.Causes of self-sterility.The appearance of highly self-fertile varieties.Self-fertilisation apparently in some respects beneficial, independentlyof the assured production of seeds.Relative weights and rates of germination of seeds from crossed andself-fertilised flowers.The present chapter is devoted to the Fertility of plants, as influencedby cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation. The subject consists oftwo distinct branches; firstly, the relative productiveness or fertilityof flowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and with their ownpollen, as shown by the proportional number of capsules which theyproduce, together with the number of the contained seeds. Secondly, thedegree of innate fertility or sterility of the seedlings raised fromcrossed and self-fertilised seeds; such seedlings being of the same age,grown under the same conditions, and fertilised in the same manner.These two branches of the subject correspond with the two which have tobe considered by any one treating of hybrid plants; namely, in the firstplace the comparative productiveness of a species when fertilised withpollen from a distinct species and with its own pollen; and in thesecond place, the fertility of its hybrid offspring. These two classesof cases do not always run parallel; thus some plants, as Gartner hasshown, can be crossed with great ease, but yield excessively sterilehybrids; while others are crossed with extreme difficulty, but yieldfairly fertile hybrids.The natural order to follow in this chapter would have been first toconsider the effects on the fertility of the parent-plants of crossingthem, and of fertilising them with their own pollen; but as we havediscussed in the two last chapters the relative height, weight, andconstitutional vigour of crossed and self-fertilised plants--that is, ofplants raised from crossed and self-fertilised seeds--it will beconvenient here first to consider their relative fertility. The casesobserved by me are given in Table 9/D, in which plants of crossed andself-fertilised parentage were left to fertilise themselves, beingeither crossed by insects or spontaneously self-fertilised. It should beobserved that the results cannot be considered as fully trustworthy, forthe fertility of a plant is a most variable element, depending on itsage, health, nature of the soil, amount of water given, and temperatureto which it is exposed. The number of the capsules produced and thenumber of the contained seeds, ought to have been ascertained on a largenumber of crossed and self-fertilised plants of the same age and treatedin every respect alike. In these two latter respects my observations maybe trusted, but a sufficient number of capsules were counted only in afew instances. The fertility, or as it may perhaps better be called theproductiveness, of a plant depends on the number of capsules produced,and on the number of seeds which these contain. But from various causes,chiefly from the want of time, I was often compelled to rely on thenumber of the capsules alone. Nevertheless, in the more interestingcases, the seeds were also counted or weighed. The average number ofseeds per capsule is a more valuable criterion of fertility than thenumber of capsules produced. This latter circumstance depends partly onthe size of the plant; and we know that crossed plants are generallytaller and heavier than the self-fertilised; but the difference in thisrespect is rarely sufficient to account for the difference in the numberof the capsules produced. It need hardly be added that in Table 9/D thesame number of crossed and self-fertilised plants are always compared.Subject to the foregoing sources of doubt I will now give the table, inwhich the parentage of the plants experimented on, and the manner ofdetermining their fertility are explained. Fuller details may be foundin the previous part of this work, under the head of each species.TABLE 9/D.--RELATIVE FERTILITY OF PLANTS OF CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISEDPARENTAGE, BOTH SETS BEING FERTILISED IN THE SAME MANNER.

average number ofseeds per capsule: 71.Primula veris--(equal-styled variety) productiveness of the same plants,as judged by the number of capsules produced and the average number ofseeds per capsule: 11.This table includes thirty-three cases relating to twenty-three species,and shows the degree of innate fertility of plants of crossed parentagein comparison with those of self-fertilised parentage; both lots beingfertilised in the same manner. With several of the species, as withEschscholtzia, Reseda, Viola, Dianthus, Petunia, and Primula, both lotswere certainly cross-fertilised by insects, and so it probably was withseveral of the others; but in some of the species, as with Nemophila,and in some of the trials with Ipomoea and Dianthus, the plants werecovered up, and both lots were spontaneously self-fertilised. This alsowas necessarily the case with the capsules produced by the cleistogeneflowers of Vandellia.The fertility of the crossed plants is represented in Table 9/D by 100,and that of the self-fertilised by the other figures. There are fivecases in which the fertility of the self-fertilised plants isapproximately equal to that of the crossed; nevertheless, in four ofthese cases the crossed plants were plainly taller, and in the fifthsomewhat taller than the self-fertilised. But I should state that insome of these five cases the fertility of the two lots was not strictlyascertained, as the capsules were not actually counted, from appearingequal in number and from all apparently containing a full complement ofseeds. In only two instances in the table, namely, with Vandellia and inthe third generation of Dianthus, the capsules on the self-fertilisedplants contained more seed than those on the crossed plants. WithDianthus the ratio between the number of seeds contained in theself-fertilised and crossed capsules was as 125 to 100; both sets ofplants were left to fertilise themselves under a net; and it is almostcertain that the greater fertility of the self-fertilised plants washere due merely to their having varied and become less strictlydichogamous, so as to mature their anthers and stigmas more nearly atthe same time than is proper to the species. Excluding the seven casesnow referred to, there remain twenty-six in which the crossed plantswere manifestly much more fertile, sometimes to an extraordinary degree,than the self-fertilised with which they grew in competition. The moststriking instances are those in which plants derived from a cross with afresh stock are compared with plants of one of the later self-fertilisedgenerations; yet there are some striking cases, as that of Viola,between the intercrossed plants of the same stock and theself-fertilised, even in the first generation. The results most to betrusted are those in which the productiveness of the plants wasascertained by the number of capsules produced by an equal number ofplants, together with the actual or average number of seeds in eachcapsule. Of such cases there are twelve in the table, and the mean oftheir mean fertility is as 100 for the crossed plants, to 59 for theself-fertilised plants. The Primulaceae seem eminently liable to sufferin fertility from self-fertilisation.The following short table, Table 9/E, includes four cases which havealready been partly given in the last table.TABLE 9/E.--INNATE FERTILITY OF PLANTS FROM A CROSS WITH A FRESH STOCK,COMPARED WITH THAT OF INTERCROSSED PLANTS OF THE SAME STOCK, AND WITHTHAT OF SELF-FERTILISED PLANTS, ALL OF THE CORRESPONDING GENERATION.FERTILITY JUDGED OF BY THE NUMBER OR WEIGHT OF SEEDS PRODUCED BY ANEQUAL NUMBER OF PLANTS.Column 1: Name of plant and feature observed.Column 2: Plants from a cross with a fresh stock.Column 3: Intercrossed plants of the same stock.Column 4: Self-fertilised plants.Mimulus luteus--the intercrossed plants are derived from a cross betweentwo plants of the 8th self-fertilised generation. The self-fertilisedplants belong to the 9th generation: 100 : 4 : 3.Eschscholtzia californica--the intercrossed and self-fertilised plantsbelong to the 2nd generation: 100 : 45 : 40.Dianthus caryophyllus--the intercrossed plants are derived fromself-fertilised of the 3rd generation, crossed by intercrossed plants ofthe 3rd generation. The self-fertilised plants belong to the 4thgeneration: 100 : 45 : 33.Petunia violacea--the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants belong tothe 5th generation: 100 : 54 : 46.NB.--In the above cases, excepting in that of Eschscholtzia, the plantsderived from a cross with a fresh stock belong on the mother-side to thesame stock with the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants, and to thecorresponding generation.These cases show us how greatly superior in innate fertility theseedlings from plants self-fertilised or intercrossed for severalgenerations and then crossed by a fresh stock are, in comparison withthe seedlings from plants of the old stock, either intercrossed orself-fertilised for the same number of generations. The three lots ofplants in each case were left freely exposed to the visits of insects,and their flowers without doubt were cross-fertilised by them.Table 9/E further shows us that in all four cases the intercrossedplants of the same stock still have a decided though small advantage infertility over the self-fertilised plants.With respect to the state of the reproductive organs in theself-fertilised plants of Tables 9/D and 9/E, only a few observationswere made. In the seventh and eighth generation of Ipomoea, the anthersin the flowers of the self-fertilised plants were plainly smaller thanthose in the flowers of the intercrossed plants. The tendency tosterility in these same plants was also shown by the first-formedflowers, after they had been carefully fertilised, often dropping off,in the same manner as frequently occurs with hybrids. The flowerslikewise tended to be monstrous. In the fourth generation of Petunia,the pollen produced by the self-fertilised and intercrossed plants wascompared, and they were far more empty and shrivelled grains in theformer.RELATIVE FERTILITY OF FLOWERS CROSSED WITH POLLEN FROM A DISTINCT PLANTAND WITH THEIR OWN POLLEN. THIS HEADING INCLUDES FLOWERS ON THEPARENT-PLANTS, AND ON THE CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISED SEEDLINGS OF THEFIRST OR A SUCCEEDING GENERATION.I will first treat of the parent-plants, which were raised from seedspurchased from nursery-gardens, or taken from plants growing in mygarden, or growing wild, and surrounded in every case by manyindividuals of the same species. Plants thus circumstanced will commonlyhave been intercrossed by insects; so that the seedlings which werefirst experimented on will generally have been the product of a cross.Consequently any difference in the fertility of their flowers, whencrossed and self-fertilised, will have been caused by the nature of thepollen employed; that is, whether it was taken from a distinct plant orfrom the same flower. The degrees of fertility shown in Table 9/F, weredetermined in each case by the average number of seeds per capsule,ascertained either by counting or weighing.Another element ought properly to have been taken into account, namely,the proportion of flowers which yielded capsules when they were crossedand self-fertilised; and as crossed flowers generally produce a largerproportion of capsules, their superiority in fertility, if this elementhad been taken into account, would have been much more strongly markedthan appears in Table 9/F. But had I thus acted, there would have beengreater liability to error, as pollen applied to the stigma at the wrongtime fails to produce any effect, independently of its greater or lesspotency. A good illustration of the great difference in the resultswhich sometimes follows, if the number of capsules produced relativelyto the number of flowers fertilised be included in the calculation, wasafforded by Nolana prostrata. Thirty flowers on some plants of thisspecies were crossed and produced twenty-seven capsules, each containingfive seeds; thirty-two flowers on the same plants were self-fertilisedand produced only six capsules, each containing five seeds. As thenumber of seeds per capsule is here the same, the fertility of thecrossed and self-fertilised flowers is given in Table 9/F as equal, oras 100 to 100. But if the flowers which failed to produce capsules beincluded, the crossed flowers yielded on an average 4.50 seeds, whilstthe self-fertilised flowers yielded only 0.94 seeds, so that theirrelative fertility would have been as 100 to 21. I should here statethat it has been found convenient to reserve for separate discussion thecases of flowers which are usually quite sterile with their own pollen.TABLE 9/f.--relative fertility of the flowers on the parent-plants usedin my experiments, when fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant andwith their own pollen.

Here twocauses combine to diminish the fertility of the self-fertilised flowers;namely, the lesser efficacy of pollen from the same flower, and theinnate lessened fertility of plants derived from self-fertilised seeds,which as we have seen in the previous Table 9/D is strongly marked. Thefertility was determined in the same manner as in Table 9/F, that is, bythe average number of seeds per capsule; and the same remarks as before,with respect to the different proportion of flowers which set capsuleswhen they are cross-fertilised and self-fertilised, are here likewiseapplicable.TABLE 9/G.--RELATIVE FERTILITY OF FLOWERS ON CROSSED AND SELF-FERTILISEDPLANTS OF THE FIRST OR SOME SUCCEEDING GENERATION; THE FORMER BEINGAGAIN FERTILISED WITH POLLEN FROM A DISTINCT PLANT, AND THE LATTER AGAINWITH THEIR OWN POLLEN.

The difference between them consists in theself-fertilised flowers in Table 9/G, being produced by self-fertilisedparents, and the crossed flowers by crossed parents, which in the latergenerations had become somewhat closely inter-related, and had beensubjected all the time to nearly the same conditions. These two tablesinclude fifty cases relating to thirty-two species. The flowers on manyother species were crossed and self-fertilised, but as only a few werethus treated, the results cannot be trusted, as far as fertility isconcerned, and are not here given. Some other cases have been rejected,as the plants were in an unhealthy condition. If we look to the figuresin the two tables expressing the ratios between the mean relativefertility of the crossed and self-fertilised flowers, we see that in amajority of cases (i.e., in thirty-five out of fifty) flowers fertilisedby pollen from a distinct plant yield more, sometimes many more, seedsthan flowers fertilised with their own pollen; and they commonly set alarger proportion of capsules. The degree of infertility of theself-fertilised flowers differs extremely in the different species, andeven, as we shall see in the section on self-sterile plants, in theindividuals of the same species, as well as under slightly changedconditions of life. Their fertility ranges from zero to fertilityequalling that of the crossed flowers; and of this fact no explanationcan be offered. There are fifteen cases in the two tables in which thenumber of seeds per capsule produced by the self-fertilised flowersequals or even exceeds that yielded by the crossed flowers. Some few ofthese cases are, I believe, accidental; that is, would not recur on asecond trial. This was apparently the case with the plants of the fifthgeneration of Ipomoea, and in one of the experiments with Dianthus.Nicotiana offers the most anomalous case of any, as the self-fertilisedflowers on the parent-plants, and on their descendants of the second andthird generations, produced more seeds than did the crossed flowers; butwe shall recur to this case when we treat of highly self-fertilevarieties.It might have been expected that the difference in fertility between thecrossed and self-fertilised flowers would have been more strongly markedin Table 9/G, in which the plants of one set were derived fromself-fertilised parents, than in Table 9/F, in which flowers on theparent-plants were self-fertilised for the first time. But this is notthe case, as far as my scanty materials allow of any judgment. There istherefore no evidence at present, that the fertility of plants goes ondiminishing in successive self-fertilised generations, although there issome rather weak evidence that this does occur with respect to theirheight or growth. But we should bear in mind that in the latergenerations the crossed plants had become more or less closelyinter-related, and had been subjected all the time to nearly uniformconditions.It is remarkable that there is no close correspondence, either in theparent-plants or in the successive generations, between the relativenumber of seeds produced by the crossed and self-fertilised flowers, andthe relative powers of growth of the seedlings raised from such seeds.Thus, the crossed and self-fertilised flowers on the parent-plants ofIpomoea, Gesneria, Salvia, Limnanthes, Lobelia fulgens, and Nolanaproduced a nearly equal number of seeds, yet the plants raised from thecrossed seeds exceeded considerably in height those raised from theself-fertilised seeds. The crossed flowers of Linaria and Viscariayielded far more seeds than the self-fertilised flowers; and althoughthe plants raised from the former were taller than those from thelatter, they were not so in any corresponding degree. With Nicotiana theflowers fertilised with their own pollen were more productive than thosecrossed with pollen from a slightly different variety; yet the plantsraised from the latter seeds were much taller, heavier, and more hardythan those raised from the self-fertilised seeds. On the other hand, thecrossed seedlings of Eschscholtzia were neither taller nor heavier thanthe self-fertilised, although the crossed flowers were far moreproductive than the self-fertilised. But the best evidence of a want ofcorrespondence between the number of seeds produced by crossed andself-fertilised flowers, and the vigour of the offspring raised fromthem, is afforded by the plants of the Brazilian and European stocks ofEschscholtzia, and likewise by certain individual plants of Resedaodorata; for it might have been expected that the seedlings from plants,the flowers of which were excessively self-sterile, would have profitedin a greater degree by a cross, than the seedlings from plants whichwere moderately or fully self-fertile, and therefore apparently had noneed to be crossed. But no such result followed in either case: forinstance, the crossed and self-fertilised offspring from a highlyself-fertile plant of Reseda odorata were in average height to eachother as 100 to 82; whereas the similar offspring from an excessivelyself-sterile plant were as 100 to 92 in average height.With respect to the innate fertility of the plants of crossed andself-fertilised parentage, given in the previous Table 9/D--that is, thenumber of seeds produced by both lots when their flowers were fertilisedin the same manner,--nearly the same remarks are applicable, inreference to the absence of any close correspondence between theirfertility and powers of growth, as in the case of the plants in theTables 9/F and 9/G, just considered. Thus the crossed andself-fertilised plants of Ipomoea, Papaver, Reseda odorata, andLimnanthes were almost equally fertile, yet the former exceededconsiderably in height the self-fertilised plants. On the other hand,the crossed and self-fertilised plants of Mimulus and Primula differedto an extreme degree in innate fertility, but by no means to acorresponding degree in height or vigour.In all the cases of self-fertilised flowers included in Tables 9/E, 9/F,and 9/G, these were fertilised with their own pollen; but there isanother form of self-fertilisation, namely, by pollen from other flowerson the same plant; but this latter method made no difference incomparison with the former in the number of seeds produced, or only aslight difference. Neither with Digitalis nor Dianthus were more seedsproduced by the one method than by the other, to any trustworthy degree.With Ipomoea rather more seeds, in the proportion of 100 to 91, wereproduced from a crossed between flowers on the same plant than fromstrictly self-fertilised flowers; but I have reason to suspect that theresult was accidental. With Origanum vulgare, however, a cross betweenflowers on plants propagated by stolons from the same stock certainlyincreased slightly their fertility. This likewise occurred, as we shallsee in the next section, with Eschscholtzia, perhaps with Corydalis cavaand Oncidium; but not so with Bignonia, Abutilon, Tabernaemontana,Senecio, and apparently Reseda odorata.SELF-STERILE PLANTS.The cases here to be described might have been introduced in Table 9/F,which gives the relative fertility of flowers fertilised with their ownpollen, and with that from a distinct plant, but it has been found moreconvenient to keep them for separate discussion. The present cases mustnot be confounded with those to be given in the next chapter relativelyto flowers which are sterile when insects are excluded; for suchsterility depends not merely on the flowers being incapable offertilisation with their own pollen, but on mechanical causes, by whichtheir pollen is prevented from reaching the stigma, or on the pollen andstigma of the same flower being matured at different periods.In the seventeenth chapter of my 'Variation of Animals and Plants underDomestication' I had occasion to enter fully on the present subject; andI will therefore here give only a brief abstract of the cases theredescribed, but others must be added, as they have an important bearingon the present work. Kolreuter long ago described plants of Verbascumphoeniceum which during two years were sterile with their own pollen,but were easily fertilised by that of four other species; these plantshowever afterwards became more or less self-fertile in a strangelyfluctuating manner. Mr. Scott also found that this species, as well astwo of its varieties, were self-sterile, as did Gartner in the case ofVerbascum nigrum. So it was, according to this latter author, with twoplants of Lobelia fulgens, though the pollen and ovules of both were inan efficient state in relation to other species. Five species ofPassiflora and certain individuals of a sixth species have been foundsterile with their own pollen; but slight changes in their conditions,such as being grafted on another stock or a change of temperature,rendered them self-fertile. Flowers on a completely self-impotent plantof Passiflora alata fertilised with pollen from its own self-impotentseedlings were quite fertile. Mr. Scott, and afterwards Mr. Munro, foundthat some species of Oncidium and of Maxillaria cultivated in a hothousein Edinburgh were quite sterile with their own pollen; and Fritz Mullerfound this to be the case with a large number of Orchidaceous generagrowing in their native home of South Brazil. (9/2. 'Botanische Zeitung'1868 page 114.) He also discovered that the pollen-masses of someorchids acted on their own stigmas like a poison; and it appears thatGartner formerly observed indications of this extraordinary fact in thecase of some other plants.Fritz Muller also states that a species of Bignonia and Tabernaemontanaechinata are both sterile with their own pollen in their native countryof Brazil. (9/3. Ibid 1868 page 626 and 1870 page 274.) SeveralAmaryllidaceous and Liliaceous plants are in the same predicament.Hildebrand observed with care Corydalis cava, and found it completelyself-sterile (9/4. 'Report of the International Horticultural Congress'1866.); but according to Caspary a few self-fertilised seeds areoccasionally produced: Corydalis halleri is only slightly self-sterile,and C. intermedia not at all so. (9/5. 'Botanische Zeitung' June 27,1873.) In another Fumariaceous genus, Hypecoum, Hildebrand observed thatH. grandiflorum was highly self-sterile, whilst H. procumbens was fairlyself-fertile. (9/6. 'Jahrb. fur wiss. Botanik' B. 7 page 464.)Thunbergia alata kept by me in a warm greenhouse was self-sterile earlyin the season, but at a later period produced many spontaneouslyself-fertilised fruits. So it was with Papaver vagum: another species,P. alpinum, was found by Professor H. Hoffmann to be quite self-sterileexcepting on one occasion (9/7. 'Zur Speciesfrage' 1875 page 47.);whilst P. somniferum has been with me always completely self-sterile.Eschscholtzia californica.This species deserves a fuller consideration. A plant cultivated byFritz Muller in South Brazil happened to flower a month before any ofthe others, and it did not produce a single capsule. This led him tomake further observations during the next six generations, and he foundthat all his plants were completely sterile, unless they were crossed byinsects or were artificially fertilised with pollen from a distinctplant, in which case they were completely fertile. (9/8. 'BotanischeZeitung' 1868 page 115 and 1869 page 223.) I was much surprised at thisfact, as I had found that English plants, when covered by a net, set aconsiderable number of capsules; and that these contained seeds byweight, compared with those on plants intercrossed by the bees, as 71 to100. Professor Hildebrand, however, found this species much moreself-sterile in Germany than it was with me in England, for the capsulesproduced by self-fertilised flowers, compared with those fromintercrossed flowers, contained seeds in the ratio of only 11 to 100. Atmy request Fritz Muller sent me from Brazil seeds of his self-sterileplants, from which I raised seedlings. Two of these were covered with anet, and one produced spontaneously only a single capsule containing nogood seeds, but yet, when artificially fertilised with its own pollen,produced a few capsules. The other plant produced spontaneously underthe net eight capsules, one of which contained no less than thirtyseeds, and on an average about ten seeds per capsule. Eight flowers onthese two plants were artificially self-fertilised, and produced sevencapsules, containing on an average twelve seeds; eight other flowerswere fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the Brazilianstock, and produced eight capsules, containing on an average abouteighty seeds: this gives a ratio of 15 seeds for the self-fertilisedcapsules to 100 for the crossed capsules. Later in the season twelveother flowers on these two plants were artificially self-fertilised; butthey yielded only two capsules, containing three and six seeds. Itappears therefore that a lower temperature than that of Brazil favoursthe self-fertility of this plant, whilst a still lower temperaturelessens it. As soon as the two plants which had been covered by the netwere uncovered, they were visited by many bees,and it was interesting toobserve how quickly they became, even the more sterile plant of the two,covered with young capsules. On the following year eight flowers onplants of the Brazilian stock of self-fertilised parentage (i.e.,grandchildren of the plants which grew in Brazil) were againself-fertilised, and produced five capsules, containing on an average27.4 seeds, with a maximum in one of forty-two seeds; so that theirself-fertility had evidently increased greatly by being reared for twogenerations in England. On the whole we may conclude that plants of theBrazilian stock are much more self-fertile in this country than inBrazil, and less so than plants of the English stock in England; so thatthe plants of Brazilian parentage retained by inheritance some of theirformer sexual constitution. Conversely, seeds from English plants sentby me to Fritz Muller and grown in Brazil, were much more self-fertilethan his plants which had been cultivated there for several generations;but he informs me that one of the plants of English parentage which didnot flower the first year, and was thus exposed for two seasons to theclimate of Brazil, proved quite self-sterile, like a Brazilian plant,showing how quickly the climate had acted on its sexual constitution.Abutilon darwinii.Seeds of this plant were sent me by Fritz Muller, who found it, as wellas some other species of the same genus, quite sterile in its nativehome of South Brazil, unless fertilised with pollen from a distinctplant, either artificially or naturally by humming-birds. (9/9.'Jenaische Zeitschr. fur Naturwiss' B. 7 1872 page 22 and 1873 page441.) Several plants were raised from these seeds and kept in thehothouse. They produced flowers very early in the spring, and twenty ofthem were fertilised, some with pollen from the same flower, and somewith pollen from other flowers on the same plants; but not a singlecapsule was thus produced, yet the stigmas twenty-seven hours after theapplication of the pollen were penetrated by the pollen-tubes. At thesame time nineteen flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinctplant, and these produced thirteen capsules, all abounding with fineseeds. A greater number of capsules would have been produced by thecross, had not some of the nineteen flowers been on a plant which wasafterwards proved to be from some unknown cause completely sterile withpollen of any kind. Thus far these plants behaved exactly like those inBrazil; but later in the season, in the latter part of May and in June,they began to produce under a net a few spontaneously self-fertilisedcapsules. As soon as this occurred, sixteen flowers were fertilised withtheir own pollen, and these produced five capsules, containing on anaverage 3.4 seeds. At the same time I selected by chance four capsulesfrom the uncovered plants growing close by, the flowers of which I hadseen visited by humble-bees, and these contained on an average 21.5seeds; so that the seeds in the naturally intercrossed capsules to thosein the self-fertilised capsules were as 100 to 16. The interesting pointin this case is that these plants, which were unnaturally treated bybeing grown in pots in a hothouse, under another hemisphere, with acomplete reversal of the seasons, were thus rendered slightlyself-fertile, whereas they seem always to be completely self-sterile intheir native home.Senecio cruentus (greenhouse varieties, commonly called Cinerarias,probably derived from several fruticose or herbaceous species muchintercrossed (9/10. I am much obliged to Mr. Moore and to Mr. ThiseltonDyer for giving me information with respect to the varieties on which Iexperimented. Mr. Moore believes that Senecio cruentas, tussilaginis,and perhaps heritieri, maderensis and populifolius have all been more orless blended together in our Cinerarias.))Two purple-flowered varieties were placed under a net in the greenhouse,and four corymbs on each were repeatedly brushed with flowers from theother plant, so that their stigmas were well covered with each other'spollen. Two of the eight corymbs thus treated produced very few seeds,but the other six produced on an average 41.3 seeds per corymb, andthese germinated well. The stigmas on four other corymbs on both plantswere well smeared with pollen from the flowers on their own corymbs;these eight corymbs produced altogether ten extremely poor seeds, whichproved incapable of germinating. I examined many flowers on both plants,and found the stigmas spontaneously covered with pollen; but theyproduced not a single seed. These plants were afterwards left uncoveredin the same house where many other Cinerarias were in flower; and theflowers were frequently visited by bees. They then produced plenty ofseed, but one of the two plants less than the other, as this speciesshows some tendency to be dioecious.The trial was repeated on another variety with white petals tipped withred. Many stigmas on two corymbs were covered with pollen from theforegoing purple variety, and these produced eleven and twenty-twoseeds, which germinated well. A large number of the stigmas on severalof the other corymbs were repeatedly smeared with pollen from their owncorymb; but they yielded only five very poor seeds, which were incapableof germination. Therefore the above three plants belonging to twovarieties, though growing vigorously and fertile with pollen from eitherof the other two plants, were utterly sterile with pollen from otherflowers on the same plant.Reseda odorata.Having observed that certain individuals were self-sterile, I coveredduring the summer of 1868 seven plants under separate nets, and willcall these plants A, B, C, D, E, F, G. They all appeared to be quitesterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that of any other plant.Fourteen flowers on A were crossed with pollen from B or C, and producedthirteen fine capsules. Sixteen flowers were fertilised with pollen fromother flowers on the same plant, but yielded not a single capsule.Fourteen flowers on B were crossed with pollen from A, C or D, and allproduced capsules; some of these were not very fine, yet they containedplenty of seeds. Eighteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from otherflowers on the same plant, and produced not one capsule.Ten flowers on C were crossed with pollen from A, B, D or E, andproduced nine fine capsules. Nineteen flowers were fertilised withpollen from other flowers on the same plant, and produced no capsules.Ten flowers on D were crossed with pollen from A, B, C or E, andproduced nine fine capsules. Eighteen flowers were fertilised withpollen from other flowers on the same plant, and produced no capsules.Seven flowers on E were crossed with pollen from A, C, or D, and allproduced fine capsules. Eight flowers were fertilised with pollen fromother flowers on the same plant, and produced no capsules.On the plants F and G no flowers were crossed, but very many (number notrecorded) were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the sameplants, and these did not produce a single capsule.We thus see that fifty-five flowers on five of the above plants werereciprocally crossed in various ways; several flowers on each of theseplants being fertilised with pollen from several of the other plants.These fifty-five flowers produced fifty-two capsules, almost all ofwhich were of full size and contained an abundance of seeds. On theother hand, seventy-nine flowers (besides many others not recorded) werefertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plants, and thesedid not produce a single capsule. In one case in which I examined thestigmas of the flowers fertilised with their own pollen, these werepenetrated by the pollen-tubes, although such penetration produced noeffect. Pollen falls generally, and I believe always, from the antherson the stigmas of the same flower; yet only three out of the above sevenprotected plants produced spontaneously any capsules, and these it mighthave been thought must have been self-fertilised. There were altogetherseven such capsules; but as they were all seated close to theartificially crossed flowers, I can hardly doubt that a few grains offoreign pollen had accidentally fallen on their stigmas. Besides theabove seven plants, four others were kept covered under the SAME largenet; and some of these produced here and there in the most capriciousmanner little groups of capsules; and this makes me believe that a bee,many of which settled on the outside of the net, being attracted by theodour, had on some one occasion found an entrance, and had intercrosseda few of the flowers.In the spring of 1869 four plants raised from fresh seeds were carefullyprotected under separate nets; and now the result was widely differentto what it was before. Three of these protected plants became actuallyloaded with capsules, especially during the early part of the summer;and this fact indicates that temperature produces some effect, but theexperiment given in the following paragraph shows that the innateconstitution of the plant is a far more important element. The fourthplant produced only a few capsules, many of them of small size; yet itwas far more self-fertile than any of the seven plants tried during theprevious year. The flowers on four small branches of thissemi-self-sterile plant were smeared with pollen from one of the otherplants, and they all produced fine capsules.As I was much surprised at the difference in the results of the trialsmade during the two previous years, six fresh plants were protected byseparate nets in the year 1870. Two of these proved almost completelyself-sterile, for on carefully searching them I found only three smallcapsules, each containing either one or two seeds of small size, which,however, germinated. A few flowers on both these plants werereciprocally fertilised with each other's pollen, and a few with pollenfrom one of the following self-fertile plants, and all these flowersproduced fine capsules. The four other plants whilst still remainingprotected beneath the nets presented a wonderful contrast (though one ofthem in a somewhat less degree than the others), for they becameactually covered with spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, asnumerous as, or very nearly so, and as fine as those on the unprotectedplants growing near.The above three spontaneously self-fertilised capsules produced by thetwo almost completely self-sterile plants, contained altogether fiveseeds; and from these I raised in the following year (1871) five plants,which were kept under separate nets. They grew to an extraordinarilylarge size, and on August 29th were examined. At first sight theyappeared entirely destitute of capsules; but on carefully searchingtheir many branches, two or three capsules were found on three of theplants, half-a-dozen on the fourth, and about eighteen on the fifthplant. But all these capsules were small, some being empty; the greaternumber contained only a single seed, and very rarely more than one.After this examination the nets were taken off, and the bees immediatelycarried pollen from one of these almost self-sterile plants to theother, for no other plants grew near. After a few weeks the ends of thebranches on all five plants became covered with capsules, presenting acurious contrast with the lower and naked parts of the same longbranches. These five plants therefore inherited almost exactly the samesexual constitution as their parents; and without doubt a self-sterilerace of Mignonette could have been easily established.Reseda lutea.Plants of this species were raised from seeds gathered from a group ofwild plants growing at no great distance from my garden. After casuallyobserving that some of these plants were self-sterile, two plants takenby hazard were protected under separate nets. One of these soon becamecovered with spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, as numerous asthose on the surrounding unprotected plants; so that it was evidentlyquite self-fertile. The other plant was partially self-sterile,producing very few capsules, many of which were of small size. When,however, this plant had grown tall, the uppermost branches becamepressed against the net and grew crooked, and in this position the beeswere able to suck the flowers through the meshes, and brought pollen tothem from the neighbouring plants. These branches then became loadedwith capsules; the other and lower branches remaining almost bare. Thesexual constitution of this species is therefore similar to that ofReseda odorata.CONCLUDING REMARKS ON SELF-STERILE PLANTS.In order to favour as far as possible the self-fertilisation of some ofthe foregoing plants, all the flowers on Reseda odorata and some ofthose on the Abutilon were fertilised with pollen from other flowers onthe same plant, instead of with their own pollen, and in the case of theSenecio with pollen from other flowers on the same corymb; but this madeno difference in the result. Fritz Muller tried both kinds ofself-fertilisation in the case of Bignonia, Tabernaemontana andAbutilon, likewise with no difference in the result. With Eschscholtzia,however, he found that pollen from other flowers on the same plant was alittle more effective than pollen from the same flower. So didHildebrand in Germany; as thirteen out of fourteen flowers ofEschscholtzia thus fertilised set capsules, these containing on anaverage 9.5 seeds; whereas only fourteen flowers out of twenty-onefertilised with their own pollen set capsules, these containing on anaverage 9.0 seeds. (9/11. 'Pringsheim's Jahrbuch fur wiss. Botanik' 7page 467.) Hildebrand found a trace of a similar difference withCorydalis cava, as did Fritz Muller with an Oncidium. (9/12. 'Variationunder Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 pages 113-115.)In considering the several cases above given of complete or almostcomplete self-sterility, we are first struck with their widedistribution throughout the vegetable kingdom. Their number is not atpresent large, for they can be discovered only by protecting plants frominsects and then fertilising them with pollen from another plant of thesame species and with their own pollen; and the latter must be proved tobe in an efficient state by other trials. Unless all this be done, it isimpossible to know whether their self-sterility may not be due to themale or female reproductive organs, or to both, having been affected bychanged conditions of life. As in the course of my experiments I havefound three new cases, and as Fritz Muller has observed indications ofseveral others, it is probable that they will hereafter be proved to befar from rare. (9/13. Mr. Wilder, the editor of a horticultural journalin the United States quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1868 page 1286,states that Lilium auratum, Impatiens pallida and fulva, and Forsythiaviridissima, cannot be fertilised with their own pollen.)As with plants of the same species and parentage, some individuals areself-sterile and others self-fertile, of which fact Reseda odorataoffers the most striking instances, it is not at all surprising thatspecies of the same genus differ in this same manner. Thus Verbascumphoeniceum and nigrum are self-sterile, whilst V. thapsus and lychnitisare quite self-fertile, as I know by trial. There is the same differencebetween some of the species of Papaver, Corydalis, and of other genera.Nevertheless, the tendency to self-sterility certainly runs to a certainextent in groups, as we see in the genus Passiflora, and with theVandeae amongst Orchids.Self-sterility differs much in degree in different plants. In thoseextraordinary cases in which pollen from the same flower acts on thestigma like a poison, it is almost certain that the plants would neveryield a single self-fertilised seed. Other plants, like Corydalis cava,occasionally, though very rarely, produce a few self-fertilised seeds. Alarge number of species, as may be seen in Table 9/F, are less fertilewith their own pollen than with that from another plant; and lastly,some species are perfectly self-fertile. Even with the individuals ofthe same species, as just remarked, some are utterly self-sterile,others moderately so, and some perfectly self-fertile. The cause,whatever it may be, which renders many plants more or less sterile withtheir own pollen, that is, when they are self-fertilised, must bedifferent, at least to a certain extent, from that which determines thedifference in height, vigour, and fertility of the seedlings raised fromself-fertilised and crossed seeds; for we have already seen that the twoclasses of cases do not by any means run parallel. This want ofparallelism would be intelligible, if it could be shown thatself-sterility depended solely on the incapacity of the pollen-tubes topenetrate the stigma of the same flower deeply enough to reach theovules; whilst the greater or less vigorous growth of the seedlings nodoubt depends on the nature of the contents of the pollen-grains andovules. Now it is certain that with some plants the stigmatic secretiondoes not properly excite the pollen-grains, so that the tubes are notproperly developed, if the pollen is taken from the same flower. This isthe case according to Fritz Muller with Eschscholtzia, for he found thatthe pollen-tubes did not penetrate the stigma deeply; and with theOrchidaceous genus Notylia they failed altogether to penetrate it.(9/14. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 pages 114, 115.)With dimorphic and trimorphic species, an illegitimate union betweenplants of the same form presents the closest analogy withself-fertilisation, whilst a legitimate union closely resemblescross-fertilisation; and here again the lessened fertility or completesterility of an illegitimate union depends, at least in part, on theincapacity for interaction between the pollen-grains and stigma. Thuswith Linum grandiflorum, as I have elsewhere shown, not more than two orthree out of hundreds of pollen-grains, either of the long-styled orshort-styled form, when placed on the stigma of their own form, emittheir tubes, and these do not penetrate deeply; nor does the stigmaitself change colour, as occurs when it is legitimately fertilised.(9/15. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 7 1863 pages73-75.)On the other hand the difference in innate fertility, as well as ingrowth between plants raised from crossed and self-fertilised seeds, andthe difference in fertility and growth between the legitimate andillegitimate offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants, must dependon some incompatibility between the sexual elements contained within thepollen-grains and ovules, as it is through their union that neworganisms are developed.If we now turn to the more immediate cause of self-sterility, we clearlysee that in most cases it is determined by the conditions to which theplants have been subjected. Thus Eschscholtzia is completelyself-sterile in the hot climate of Brazil, but is perfectly fertilethere with the pollen of any other individual. The offspring ofBrazilian plants became in England in a single generation partiallyself-fertile, and still more so in the second generation. Conversely,the offspring of English plants, after growing for two seasons inBrazil, became in the first generation quite self-sterile. Again,Abutilon darwinii, which is self-sterile in its native home of Brazil,became moderately self-fertile in a single generation in an Englishhothouse. Some other plants are self-sterile during the early part ofthe year, and later in the season become self-fertile. Passiflora alatalost its self-sterility when grafted on another species. With Reseda,however, in which some individuals of the same parentage areself-sterile and others are self-fertile, we are forced in our ignoranceto speak of the cause as due to spontaneous variability; but we shouldremember that the progenitors of these plants, either on the male orfemale side, may have been exposed to somewhat different conditions. Thepower of the environment thus to affect so readily and in so peculiar amanner the reproductive organs, is a fact which has many importantbearings; and I have therefore thought the foregoing details worthgiving. For instance, the sterility of many animals and plants underchanged conditions of life, such as confinement, evidently comes withinthe same general principle of the sexual system being easily affected bythe environment. It has already been proved, that a cross between plantswhich have been self-fertilised or intercrossed during severalgenerations, having been kept all the time under closely similarconditions, does not benefit the offspring; and on the other hand, thata cross between plants that have been subjected to different conditionsbenefits the offspring to an extraordinary degree. We may thereforeconclude that some degree of differentiation in the sexual system isnecessary for the full fertility of the parent-plants and for the fullvigour of their offspring. It seems also probable that with those plantswhich are capable of complete self-fertilisation, the male and femaleelements and organs already differ to an extent sufficient to excitetheir mutual interaction; but that when such plants are taken to anothercountry, and become in consequence self-sterile, their sexual elementsand organs are so acted on as to be rendered too uniform for suchinteraction, like those of a self-fertilised plant long cultivated underthe same conditions. Conversely, we may further infer that plants whichare self-sterile in their native country, but become self-fertile underchanged conditions, have their sexual elements so acted on, that theybecome sufficiently differentiated for mutual interaction.We know that self-fertilised seedlings are inferior in many respects tothose from a cross; and as with plants in a state of nature pollen fromthe same flower can hardly fail to be often left by insects or by thewind on the stigma, it seems at first sight highly probable thatself-sterility has been gradually acquired through natural selection inorder to prevent self-fertilisation. It is no valid objection to thisbelief that the structure of some flowers, and the dichogamous conditionof many others, suffice to prevent the pollen reaching the stigma of thesame flower; for we should remember that with most species many flowersexpand at the same time, and that pollen from the same plant is equallyinjurious or nearly so as that from the same flower. Nevertheless, thebelief that self-sterility is a quality which has been graduallyacquired for the special purpose of preventing self-fertilisation must,I believe, be rejected. In the first place, there is no closecorrespondence in degree between the sterility of the parent-plants whenself-fertilised, and the extent to which their offspring suffer invigour by this process; and some such correspondence might have beenexpected if self-sterility had been acquired on account of the injurycaused by self-fertilisation. The fact of individuals of the sameparentage differing greatly in their degree of self-sterility islikewise opposed to such a belief; unless, indeed, we suppose thatcertain individuals have been rendered self-sterile to favourintercrossing, whilst other individuals have been rendered self-fertileto ensure the propagation of the species. The fact of self-sterileindividuals appearing only occasionally, as in the case of Lobelia, doesnot countenance this latter view. But the strongest argument against thebelief that self-sterility has been acquired to preventself-fertilisation, is the immediate and powerful effect of changedconditions in either causing or in removing self-sterility. We are nottherefore justified in admitting that this peculiar state of thereproductive system has been gradually acquired through naturalselection; but we must look at it as an incidental result, dependent onthe conditions to which the plants have been subjected, like theordinary sterility caused in the case of animals by confinement, and inthe case of plants by too much manure, heat, etc. I do not, however,wish to maintain that self-sterility may not sometimes be of service toa plant in preventing self-fertilisation; but there are so many othermeans by which this result might be prevented or rendered difficult,including as we shall see in the next chapter the prepotency of pollenfrom a distinct individual over a plant's own pollen, thatself-sterility seems an almost superfluous acquirement for this purpose.Finally, the most interesting point in regard to self-sterile plants isthe evidence which they afford of the advantage, or rather of thenecessity, of some degree or kind of differentiation in the sexualelements, in order that they should unite and give birth to a new being.It was ascertained that the five plants of Reseda odorata which wereselected by chance, could be perfectly fertilised by pollen taken fromany one of them, but not by their own pollen; and a few additionaltrials were made with some other individuals, which I have not thoughtworth recording. So again, Hildebrand and Fritz Muller frequently speakof self-sterile plants being fertile with the pollen of any otherindividual; and if there had been any exceptions to the rule, thesecould hardly have escaped their observation and my own. We may thereforeconfidently assert that a self-sterile plant can be fertilised by thepollen of any one out of a thousand or ten thousand individuals of thesame species, but not by its own. Now it is obviously impossible thatthe sexual organs and elements of every individual can have beenspecialised with respect to every other individual. But there is nodifficulty in believing that the sexual elements of each differ slightlyin the same diversified manner as do their external characters; and ithas often been remarked that no two individuals are absolutely alike.Therefore we can hardly avoid the conclusion, that differences of ananalogous and indefinite nature in the reproductive system aresufficient to excite the mutual action of the sexual elements, and thatunless there be such differentiation fertility fails.THE APPEARANCE OF HIGHLY SELF-FERTILE VARIETIES.We have just seen that the degree to which flowers are capable of beingfertilised with their own pollen differs much, both with the species ofthe same genus, and sometimes with the individuals of the same species.Some allied cases of the appearance of varieties which, whenself-fertilised, yield more seed and produce offspring growing tallerthan their self-fertilised parents, or than the intercrossed plants ofthe corresponding generation, will now be considered.Firstly, in the third and fourth generations of Mimulus luteus, a tallvariety, often alluded to, having large white flowers blotched withcrimson, appeared amongst both the intercrossed and self-fertilisedplants. It prevailed in all the later self-fertilised generations to theexclusion of every other variety, and transmitted its charactersfaithfully, but disappeared from the intercrossed plants, owing no doubtto their characters being repeatedly blended by crossing. Theself-fertilised plants belonging to this variety were not only taller,but more fertile than the intercrossed plants; though these latter inthe earlier generations were much taller and more fertile than theself-fertilised plants. Thus in the fifth generation the self-fertilisedplants were to the intercrossed in height as 126 to 100. In the sixthgeneration they were likewise much taller and finer plants, but were notactually measured; they produced capsules compared with those on theintercrossed plants, in number, as 147 to 100; and the self-fertilisedcapsules contained a greater number of seeds. In the seventh generationthe self-fertilised plants were to the crossed in height as 137 to 100;and twenty flowers on these self-fertilised plants fertilised with theirown pollen yielded nineteen very fine capsules,--a degree ofself-sterility which I have not seen equalled in any other case. Thisvariety seems to have become specially adapted to profit in every way byself-fertilisation, although this process was so injurious to theparent-plants during the first four generations. It should however beremembered that seedlings raised from this variety, when crossed by afresh stock, were wonderfully superior in height and fertility to theself-fertilised plants of the corresponding generation.Secondly, in the sixth self-fertilised generation of Ipomoea a singleplant named the Hero appeared, which exceeded by a little in height itsintercrossed opponent,--a case which had not occurred in any previousgeneration. Hero transmitted the peculiar colour of its flowers, as wellas its increased tallness and a high degree of self-fertility, to itschildren, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The self-fertilisedchildren of Hero were in height to other self-fertilised plants of thesame stock as 100 to 85. Ten self-fertilised capsules produced by thegrandchildren contained on an average 5.2 seeds; and this is a higheraverage than was yielded in any other generation by the capsules ofself-fertilised flowers. The great-grandchildren of Hero derived from across with a fresh stock were so unhealthy, from having been grown at anunfavourable season, that their average height in comparison with thatof the self-fertilised plants cannot be judged of with any safety; butit did not appear that they had profited even by a cross of this kind.Thirdly, the plants of Nicotiana on which I experimented appear to comeunder the present class of cases; for they varied in their sexualconstitution and were more or less highly self-fertile. They wereprobably the offspring of plants which had been spontaneouslyself-fertilised under glass for several generations in this country. Theflowers on the parent-plants which were first fertilised by me withtheir own pollen yielded half again as many seeds as did those whichwere crossed; and the seedlings raised from these self-fertilised seedsexceeded in height those raised from the crossed seeds to anextraordinary degree. In the second and third generations, although theself-fertilised plants did not exceed the crossed in height, yet theirself-fertilised flowers yielded on two occasions considerably more seedsthan the crossed flowers, even than those which were crossed with pollenfrom a distinct stock or variety.Lastly, as certain individual plants of Reseda odorata and lutea areincomparably more self-fertile than other individuals, the former mightbe included under the present heading of the appearance of new andhighly self-fertile varieties. But in this case we should have to lookat these two species as normally self-sterile; and this, judging by myexperience, appears to be the correct view.We may therefore conclude from the facts now given, that varietiessometimes arise which when self-fertilised possess an increased power ofproducing seeds and of growing to a greater height, than theintercrossed or self-fertilised plants of the correspondinggeneration--all the plants being of course subjected to the sameconditions. The appearance of such varieties is interesting, as it bearson the existence under nature of plants which regularly fertilisethemselves, such as Ophrys apifera and a few other orchids, or asLeersia oryzoides, which produces an abundance of cleistogene flowers,but most rarely flowers capable of cross-fertilisation.Some observations made on other plants lead me to suspect thatself-fertilisation is in some respects beneficial; although the benefitthus derived is as a rule very small compared with that from a crosswith a distinct plant. Thus we have seen in the last chapter thatseedlings of Ipomoea and Mimulus raised from flowers fertilised withtheir own pollen, which is the strictest possible form ofself-fertilisation, were superior in height, weight, and in earlyflowering to the seedlings raised from flowers crossed with pollen fromother flowers on the same plant; and this superiority apparently was toostrongly marked to be accidental. Again, the cultivated varieties of thecommon pea are highly self-fertile, although they have beenself-fertilised for many generations; and they exceeded in heightseedlings from a cross between two plants belonging to the same varietyin the ratio of 115 to 100; but then only four pairs of plants weremeasured and compared. The self-fertility of Primula veris increasedafter several generations of illegitimate fertilisation, which is aprocess closely analogous to self-fertilisation, but only as long as theplants were cultivated under the same favourable conditions. I have alsoelsewhere shown that with Primula veris and sinensis, equal-styledvarieties occasionally appear which possess the sexual organs of the twoforms combined in the same flower. (9/16. 'Journal of the LinneanSociety Botany' volume 10 1867 pages 417, 419.) Consequently theyfertilise themselves in a legitimate manner and are highly self-fertile;but the remarkable fact is that they are rather more fertile thanordinary plants of the same species legitimately fertilised by pollenfrom a distinct individual. Formerly it appeared to me probable, thatthe increased fertility of these dimorphic plants might be accounted forby the stigma lying so close to the anthers that it was impregnated atthe most favourable age and time of the day; but this explanation is notapplicable to the above given cases, in which the flowers wereartificially fertilised with their own pollen.Considering the facts now adduced, including the appearance of thosevarieties which are more fertile and taller than their parents and thanthe intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation, it is difficultto avoid the suspicion that self-fertilisation is in some respectsadvantageous; though if this be really the case, any such advantage isas a rule quite insignificant compared with that from a cross with adistinct plant, and especially with one of a fresh stock. Should thissuspicion be hereafter verified, it would throw light, as we shall seein the next chapter, on the existence of plants bearing small andinconspicuous flowers which are rarely visited by insects, and thereforeare rarely intercrossed.RELATIVE WEIGHT AND PERIOD OF GERMINATION OF SEEDS FROM CROSSED ANDSELF-FERTILISED FLOWERS.An equal number of seeds from flowers fertilised with pollen fromanother plant, and from flowers fertilised with their own pollen, wereweighed, but only in sixteen cases. Their relative weights are given inthe following list; that of the seeds from the crossed flowers beingtaken as 100.Column 1: Name of Plant.Column 2: x, in the expression, 100 to x.Ipomoea purpurea (parent plants): 127.Ipomoea purpurea (third generation):  87.Salvia coccinea: 100.Brassica oleracea: 103.Iberis umbellata (second generation): 136.Delphinium consolida:  45.Hibiscus africanus: 105.Tropaeolum minus: 115.Lathyrus odoratus (about): 100.Sarothamnus scoparius:  88.Specularia speculum:  86.Nemophila insignis: 105.Borago officinalis: 111.Cyclamen persicum (about):  50.Fagopyrum esculentum:  82.Canna warscewiczi (3 generations): 102.It is remarkable that in ten out of these sixteen cases theself-fertilised seeds were either superior or equal to the crossed inweight; nevertheless, in six out of the ten cases (namely, with Ipomoea,Salvia, Brassica, Tropaeolum, Lathyrus, and Nemophila) the plants raisedfrom these self-fertilised seeds were very inferior in height and inother respects to those raised from the crossed seeds. The superiorityin weight of the self-fertilised seeds in at least six out of the tencases, namely, with Brassica, Hibiscus, Tropaeolum, Nemophila, Borago,and Canna, may be accounted for in part by the self-fertilised capsulescontaining fewer seeds; for when a capsule contains only a few seeds,these will be apt to be better nourished, so as to be heavier, than whenmany are contained in the same capsule. It should, however, be observedthat in some of the above cases, in which the crossed seeds were theheaviest, as with Sarothamnus and Cyclamen, the crossed capsulescontained a larger number of seeds. Whatever may be the explanation ofthe self-fertilised seeds being often the heaviest, it is remarkable inthe case of Brassica, Tropaeolum, Nemophila, and of the first generationof Ipomoea, that the seedlings raised from them were inferior in heightand in other respects to the seedlings raised from the crossed seeds.This fact shows how superior in constitutional vigour the crossedseedlings must have been, for it cannot be doubted that heavy and fineseeds tend to yield the finest plants. Mr. Galton has shown that thisholds good with Lathyrus odoratus; as has Mr. A.J. Wilson with theSwedish turnip, Brassica campestris ruta baga. Mr. Wilson separated thelargest and smallest seeds of this latter plant, the ratio between theweights of the two lots being as 100 to 59, and he found that theseedlings "from the larger seeds took the lead and maintained theirsuperiority to the last, both in height and thickness of stem." (9/17.'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1867 page 107. Loiseleur-Deslongchamp 'LesCereales' 1842 pages 208-219, was led by his observations to theextraordinary conclusion that the smaller grains of cereals produce asfine plants as the large. This conclusion is, however, contradicted byMajor Hallet's great success in improving wheat by the selection of thefinest grains. It is possible, however, that man, by long-continuedselection, may have given to the grains of the cereals a greater amountof starch or other matter, than the seedlings can utilise for theirgrowth. There can be little doubt, as Humboldt long ago remarked, thatthe grains of cereals have been rendered attractive to birds in a degreewhich is highly injurious to the species.) Nor can this difference inthe growth of the seedling turnips be attributed to the heavier seedshaving been of crossed, and the lighter of self-fertilised origin, forit is known that plants belonging to this genus are habituallyintercrossed by insects.With respect to the relative period of germination of crossed andself-fertilised seeds, a record was kept in only twenty-one cases; andthe results are very perplexing. Neglecting one case in which the twolots germinated simultaneously, in ten cases or exactly one-half many ofthe self-fertilised seeds germinated before the crossed, and in theother half many of the crossed before the self-fertilised. In four outof these twenty cases, seeds derived from a cross with a fresh stockwere compared with self-fertilised seeds from one of the laterself-fertilised generations; and here again in half the cases thecrossed seeds, and in the other half the self-fertilised seeds,germinated first. Yet the seedlings of Mimulus raised from suchself-fertilised seeds were inferior in all respects to the crossedseedlings, and in the case of Eschscholtzia they were inferior infertility. Unfortunately the relative weight of the two lots of seedswas ascertained in only a few instances in which their germination wasobserved; but with Ipomoea and I believe with some of the other species,the relative lightness of the self-fertilised seeds apparentlydetermined their early germination, probably owing to the smaller massbeing favourable to the more rapid completion of the chemical andmorphological changes necessary for germination. On the other hand, Mr.Galton gave me seeds (no doubt all self-fertilised) of Lathyrusodoratus, which were divided into two lots of heavier and lighter seeds;and several of the former germinated first. It is evident that many moreobservations are necessary before anything can be decided with respectto the relative period of germination of crossed and self-fertilisedseeds.CHAPTER X.MEANS OF FERTILISATION.Sterility and fertility of plants when insects are excluded.The means by which flowers are cross-fertilised.Structures favourable to self-fertilisation.Relation between the structure and conspicuousness of flowers, thevisits of insects, and the advantages of cross-fertilisation.The means by which flowers are fertilised with pollen from a distinctplant.Greater fertilising power of such pollen.Anemophilous species.Conversion of anemophilous species into entomophilous.Origin of nectar.Anemophilous plants generally have their sexes separated.Conversion of diclinous into hermaphrodite flowers.Trees often have their sexes separated.In the introductory chapter I briefly specified the various means bywhich cross-fertilisation is favoured or ensured, namely, the separationof the sexes,--the maturity of the male and female sexual elements atdifferent periods,--the heterostyled or dimorphic and trimorphiccondition of certain plants,--many mechanical contrivances,--the more orless complete inefficiency of a flower's own pollen on the stigma,--andthe prepotency of pollen from any other individual over that from thesame plant. Some of these points require further consideration; but forfull details I must refer the reader to the several excellent worksmentioned in the introduction. I will in the first place give two lists:the first, of plants which are either quite sterile or produce less thanabout half the full complement of seeds, when insects are excluded; anda second list of plants which, when thus treated, are fully fertile orproduce at least half the full complement of seeds. These lists havebeen compiled from the several previous tables, with some additionalcases from my own observations and those of others. The species arearranged nearly in the order followed by Lindley in his 'VegetableKingdom.' The reader should observe that the sterility or fertility ofthe plants in these two lists depends on two wholly distinct causes;namely, the absence or presence of the proper means by which pollen isapplied to the stigma, and its less or greater efficiency when thusapplied. As it is obvious that with plants in which the sexes areseparate, pollen must be carried by some means from flower to flower,such species are excluded from the lists; as are likewise dimorphic andtrimorphic plants, in which the same necessity occurs to a limitedextent. Experience has proved to me that, independently of the exclusionof insects, the seed-bearing power of a plant is not lessened bycovering it while in flower under a thin net supported on a frame; andthis might indeed have been inferred from the consideration of the twofollowing lists, as they include a considerable number of speciesbelonging to the same genera, some of which are quite sterile and othersquite fertile when protected by a net from the access of insects.[LIST OF PLANTS WHICH, WHEN INSECTS ARE EXCLUDED, ARE EITHER QUITESTERILE, OR PRODUCE, AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE, LESS THAN HALF THE NUMBEROF SEEDS PRODUCED BY UNPROTECTED PLANTS.Passiflora alata, racemosa, coerulea, edulis, laurifolia, and someindividuals of P. quadrangularis (Passifloraceae), are quite sterileunder these conditions: see 'Variation of Animals and Plants underDomestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 page 118.Viola canina (Violaceae).--Perfect flowers quite sterile unlessfertilised by bees, or artificially fertilised.Viola tricolor.--Sets very few and poor capsules.Reseda odorata (Resedaceae).--Some individuals quite sterile.Reseda lutea.--Some individuals produce very few and poor capsules.Abutilon darwinii (Malvaceae).--Quite sterile in Brazil: see previousdiscussion on self-sterile plants.Nymphaea (Nymphaeaceae).--Professor Caspary informs me that some of thespecies are quite sterile if insects are excluded.Euryale amazonica (Nymphaeaceae).--Mr. J. Smith, of Kew, informs me thatcapsules from flowers left to themselves, and probably not visited byinsects, contained from eight to fifteen seeds; those from flowersartificially fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plantcontained from fifteen to thirty seeds; and that two flowers fertilisedwith pollen brought from another plant at Chatsworth containedrespectively sixty and seventy-five seeds. I have given these statementsbecause Professor Caspary advances this plant as a case opposed to thedoctrine of the necessity or advantage of cross-fertilisation: seeSitzungsberichte der Phys.-okon. Gesell.zu Konigsberg, B.6 page 20.)Delphinium consolida (Ranunculaceae).--Produces many capsules, but thesecontain only about half the number of seeds compared with capsules fromflowers naturally fertilised by bees.Eschscholtzia californica (Papaveraceae).--Brazilian plants quitesterile: English plants produce a few capsules.Papaver vagum (Papaveraceae).--In the early part of the summer producedvery few capsules, and these contained very few seeds.Papaver alpinum.--H. Hoffmann ('Speciesfrage' 1875 page 47) states thatthis species produced seeds capable of germination only on one occasion.Corydalis cava (Fumariaceae).--Sterile: see the previous discussion onself-sterile plants.Corydalis solida.--I had a single plant in my garden (1863), and sawmany hive-bees sucking the flowers, but not a single seed was produced.I was much surprised at this fact, as Professor Hildebrand's discoverythat C. cava is sterile with its own pollen had not then been made. Helikewise concludes from the few experiments which he made on the presentspecies that it is self-sterile. The two foregoing cases areinteresting, because botanists formerly thought (see, for instance,Lecoq, 'De la Fecondation et de l'Hybridation' 1845 page 61 and Lindley'Vegetable Kingdom' 1853 page 436) that all the species of theFumariaceae were specially adapted for self-fertilisation.Corydalis lutea.--A covered-up plant produced (1861) exactly half asmany capsules as an exposed plant of the same size growing closealongside. When humble-bees visit the flowers (and I repeatedly saw themthus acting) the lower petals suddenly spring downwards and the pistilupwards; this is due to the elasticity of the parts, which takes effect,as soon as the coherent edges of the hood are separated by the entranceof an insect. Unless insects visit the flowers the parts do not move.Nevertheless, many of the flowers on the plants which I had protectedproduced capsules, notwithstanding that their petals and pistils stillretained their original position; and I found to my surprise that thesecapsules contained more seeds than those from flowers, the petals ofwhich had been artificially separated and allowed to spring apart. Thus,nine capsules produced by undisturbed flowers contained fifty-threeseeds; whilst nine capsules from flowers, the petals of which had beenartificially separated, contained only thirty-two seeds. But we shouldremember that if bees had been permitted to visit these flowers, theywould have visited them at the best time for fertilisation. The flowers,the petals of which had been artificially separated, set their capsulesbefore those which were left undisturbed under the net. To show withwhat certainty the flowers are visited by bees, I may add that on oneoccasion all the flowers on some unprotected plants were examined, andevery single one had its petals separated; and, on a second occasion,forty-one out of forty-three flowers were in this state. Hildebrandstates (Pring. Jahr. f. wiss. Botanik, B. 7 page 450) that the mechanismof the parts in this species is nearly the same as in C. ochroleuca,which he has fully described.Hypecoum grandiflorum (Fumariaceae).--Highly self-sterile (Hildebrand,ibid.).Kalmia latifolia (Ericaceae).--Mr. W.J. Beal says ('American Naturalist'1867) that flowers protected from insects wither and drop off, with"most of the anthers still remaining in the pockets."Pelargonium zonale (Geraniaceae).--Almost sterile; one plant producedtwo fruits. It is probable that different varieties would differ in thisrespect, as some are only feebly dichogamous.Dianthus caryophyllus (Caryophyllaceae).--Produces very few capsuleswhich contain any good seeds.Phaseolus multiflorus (Leguminosae).--Plants protected from insectsproduced on two occasions about one-third and one-eighth of the fullnumber of seeds: see my article in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 225and 1858 page 828; also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rdseries volume 2 1858 page 462. Dr. Ogle ('Popular Science Review' 1870page 168) found that a plant was quite sterile when covered up. Theflowers are not visited by insects in Nicaragua, and, according to Mr.Belt, the species is there quite sterile: 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua'page 70.Vicia faba (Leguminosae).--Seventeen covered-up plants yielded 40 beans,whilst seventeen plants left unprotected and growing close alongsideproduced 135 beans; these latter plants were, therefore, between threeand four times more fertile than the protected plants: see 'Gardeners'Chronicle' for fuller details, 1858 page 828.Erythrina (sp.?) (Leguminosae).--Sir W. MacArthur informed me that inNew South Wales the flowers do not set, unless the petals are moved inthe same manner as is done by insects.Lathyrus grandiflorus (Leguminosae).--Is in this country more or lesssterile. It never sets pods unless the flowers are visited byhumble-bees (and this happens only rarely), or unless they areartificially fertilised: see my article in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1858page 828.Sarothamnus scoparius (Leguminosae).--Extremely sterile when the flowersare neither visited by bees, nor disturbed by being beaten by the windagainst the surrounding net.Melilotus officinalis (Leguminosae).--An unprotected plant visited bybees produced at least thirty times more seeds than a protected one. Onthis latter plant many scores of racemes did not produce a single pod;several racemes produced each one or two pods; five produced three; sixproduced four; and one produced six pods. On the unprotected plant eachof several racemes produced fifteen pods; nine produced between sixteenand twenty-two pods, and one produced thirty pods.Lotus corniculatus (Leguminosae).--Several covered-up plants producedonly two empty pods, and not a single good seed.Trifolium repens (Leguminosae).--Several plants were protected frominsects, and the seeds from ten flowers-heads on these plants, and fromten heads on other plants growing outside the net (which I saw visitedby bees), were counted; and the seeds from the latter plants were verynearly ten times as numerous as those from the protected plants. Theexperiment was repeated on the following year; and twenty protectedheads now yielded only a single aborted seed, whilst twenty heads on theplants outside the net (which I saw visited by bees) yielded 2290 seeds,as calculated by weighing all the seed, and counting the number in aweight of two grains.Trifolium pratense.--One hundred flower-heads on plants protected by anet did not produce a single seed, whilst 100 heads on plants growingoutside, which were visited by bees, yielded 68 grains weight of seeds;and as eighty seeds weighed two grains, the 100 heads must have yielded2720 seeds. I have often watched this plant, and have never seenhive-bees sucking the flowers, except from the outside through holesbitten by humble-bees, or deep down between the flowers, as if in searchof some secretion from the calyx, almost in the same manner as describedby Mr. Farrer, in the case of Coronilla ('Nature' 1874 July 2 page 169).I must, however, except one occasion, when an adjoining field ofsainfoin (Hedysarum onobrychis) had just been cut down, and when thebees seemed driven to desperation. On this occasion most of the flowersof the clover were somewhat withered, and contained an extraordinaryquantity of nectar, which the bees were able to suck. An experiencedapiarian, Mr. Miner, says that in the United States hive-bees never suckthe red clover; and Mr. R. Colgate informs me that he has observed thesame fact in New Zealand after the introduction of the hive-bee intothat island. On the other hand, H. Muller ('Befruchtung' page 224) hasoften seen hive-bees visiting this plant in Germany, for the sake bothof pollen and nectar, which latter they obtained by breaking apart thepetals. It is at least certain that humble-bees are the chieffertilisers of the common red clover.Trifolium incarnatum.--The flower-heads containing ripe seeds, on somecovered and uncovered plants, appeared equally fine, but this was afalse appearance; 60 heads on the latter yielded 349 grains weight ofseeds, whereas 60 on the covered-up plants yielded only 63 grains, andmany of the seeds in the latter lot were poor and aborted. Therefore theflowers which were visited by bees produced between five and six timesas many seeds as those which were protected. The covered-up plants nothaving been much exhausted by seed-bearing, bore a second considerablecrop of flower-stems, whilst the exposed plants did not do so.Cytisus laburnum (Leguminosae).--Seven flower-racemes ready to expandwere enclosed in a large bag made of net, and they did not seem in theleast injured by this treatment. Only three of them produced any pods,each a single one; and these three pods contained one, four, and fiveseeds. So that only a single pod from the seven racemes included a faircomplement of seeds.Cuphea purpurea (Lythraceae).--Produced no seeds. Other flowers on thesame plant artificially fertilised under the net yielded seeds.Vinca major (Apocynaceae).--Is generally quite sterile, but sometimessets seeds when artificially cross-fertilised: see my notice 'Gardeners'Chronicle' 1861 page 552.Vinca rosea.--Behaves in the same manner as the last species:'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1861 page 699, 736, 831.Tabernaemontana echinata (Apocynaceae).--Quite sterile.Petunia violacea (Solanaceae).--Quite sterile, as far as I haveobserved.Solanum tuberosum (Solanaceae).--Tinzmann says ('Gardeners' Chronicle'1846 page 183) that some varieties are quite sterile unless fertilisedby pollen from another variety.Primula scotica (Primulaceae).--A non-dimorphic species, which isfertile with its own pollen, but is extremely sterile if insects areexcluded. J. Scott in 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 81864 page 119.Cortusa matthioli (Primulaceae).--Protected plants completely sterile;artificially self-fertilised flowers perfectly fertile. J. Scott ibid.page 84.Cyclamen persicum (Primulaceae).--During one season several covered-upplants did not produce a single seed.Borago officinalis (Boraginaceae).--Protected plants produced about halfas many seeds as the unprotected.Salvia tenori (Labiatae).--Quite sterile; but two or three flowers onthe summits of three of the spikes, which touched the net when the windblew, produced a few seeds. This sterility was not due to the injuriouseffects of the net, for I fertilised five flowers with pollen from anadjoining plant, and these all yielded fine seeds. I removed the net,whilst one little branch still bore a few not completely faded flowers,and these were visited by bees and yielded seeds.Salvia coccinea.--Some covered-up plants produced a good many fruits,but not, I think, half as many as did the uncovered plants; twenty-eightof the fruits spontaneously produced by the protected plant contained onan average only 1.45 seeds, whilst some artificially self-fertilisedfruits on the same plant contained more than twice as many, namely 3.3seeds.Bignonia (unnamed species) (Bignoniaceae).--Quite sterile: see myaccount of self-sterile plants.Digitalis purpurea (Scrophulariaceae).--Extremely sterile, only a fewpoor capsules being produced.Linaria vulgaris (Scrophulariaceae).--Extremely sterile.Antirrhinum majus, red var. (Scrophulariaceae).--Fifty pods gatheredfrom a large plant under a net contained 9.8 grains weight of seeds; butmany (unfortunately not counted) of the fifty pods contained no seeds.Fifty pods on a plant fully exposed to the visits of humble-beescontained 23.1 grains weight of seed, that is, more than twice theweight; but in this case again, several of the fifty pods contained noseeds.Antirrhinum majus (white var., with a pink mouth to the corolla).--Fiftypods, of which only a very few were empty, on a covered-up plantcontained 20 grains weight of seed; so that this variety seems to bemuch more self-fertile than the previous one. With Dr. W. Ogle ('PopularScience Review' January 1870 page 52) a plant of this species was muchmore sterile when protected from insects than with me, for it producedonly two small capsules. As showing the efficiency of bees, I may addthat Mr. Crocker castrated some young flowers and left them uncovered;and these produced as many seeds as the unmutilated flowers.Antirrhinum majus (peloric var.).--This variety is quite fertile whenartificially fertilised with its own pollen, but is utterly sterile whenleft to itself and uncovered, as humble-bees cannot crawl into thenarrow tubular flowers.Verbascum phoeniceum (Scrophulariaceae).--Quite sterile. See my accountof self-sterile plants.Verbascum nigrum.--Quite sterile. See my account of self-sterile plants.Campanula carpathica (Lobeliaceae).--Quite sterile.Lobelia ramosa (Lobeliaceae).--Quite sterile.Lobelia fulgens.--This plant is never visited in my garden by bees, andis quite sterile; but in a nursery-garden at a few miles' distance I sawhumble-bees visiting the flowers, and they produced some capsules.Isotoma (a white-flowered var.) (Lobeliaceae).--Five plants leftunprotected in my greenhouse produced twenty-four fine capsules,containing altogether 12.2 grains weight of seed, and thirteen othervery poor capsules, which were rejected. Five plants protected frominsects, but otherwise exposed to the same conditions as the aboveplants, produced sixteen fine capsules, and twenty other very poor andrejected ones. The sixteen fine capsules contained seeds by weight insuch proportion that twenty-four would have yielded 4.66 grains. So thatthe unprotected plants produced nearly thrice as many seeds by weight asthe protected plants.Leschenaultia formosa (Goodeniaceae).--Quite sterile. My experiments onthis plant, showing the necessity of insect aid, are given in the'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1871 page 1166.Senecio cruentus (Compositae).--Quite sterile: see my account ofself-sterile plants.Heterocentron mexicanum (Malastomaceae).--Quite sterile; but thisspecies and the following members of the group produce plenty of seedwhen artificially self-fertilised.Rhexia glandulosa (Melastomaceae).--Set spontaneously only two or threecapsules.Centradenia floribunda (Melastomaceae).--During some years producedspontaneously two or three capsules, sometimes none.Pleroma (unnamed species from Kew) (Melastomaceae).--During some yearsproduced spontaneously two or three capsules, sometimes none.Monochaetum ensiferum (Melastomaceae).--During some years producedspontaneously two or three capsules, sometimes none.Hedychium (unnamed species) (Marantaceae).--Almost self-sterile withoutaid.Orchideae.--An immense proportion of the species sterile, if insects areexcluded.LIST OF PLANTS, WHICH WHEN PROTECTED FROM INSECTS ARE EITHER QUITEFERTILE, OR YIELD MORE THAN HALF THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PRODUCED BYUNPROTECTED PLANTS.Passiflora gracilis (Passifloraceae).--Produces many fruits, but thesecontain fewer seeds than fruits from intercrossed flowers.Brassica oleracea (Cruciferae).--Produces many capsules, but thesegenerally not so rich in seed as those on uncovered plants.Raphanus sativus (Cruciferae).--Half of a large branching plant wascovered by a net, and was as thickly covered with capsules as the otherand unprotected half; but twenty of the capsules on the latter containedon an average 3.5 seeds, whilst twenty of the protected capsulescontained only 1.85 seeds, that is, only a little more than half thenumber. This plant might perhaps have been more properly included in theformer list.Iberis umbellata (Cruciferae).--Highly fertile.Iberis amara.--Highly fertile.Reseda odorata and lutea (Resedaceae).--Certain individuals completelyself-fertile.Euryale ferox (Nymphaeaceae).--Professor Caspary informs me that thisplant is highly self-fertile when insects are excluded. He remarks inthe paper before referred to, that his plants (as well as those of theVictoria regia) produce only one flower at a time; and that as thisspecies is an annual, and was introduced in 1809, it must have beenself-fertilised for the last fifty-six generations; but Dr. Hookerassures me that to his knowledge it has been repeatedly introduced, andthat at Kew the same plant both of the Euryale and of the Victoriaproduce several flowers at the same time.Nymphaea (Nymphaeaceae).--Some species, as I am informed by ProfessorCaspary, are quite self-fertile when insects are excluded.Adonis aestivalis (Ranunculaceae).--Produces, according to Professor H.Hoffmann ('Speciesfrage' page 11), plenty of seeds when protected frominsects.Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae).--Produces plenty of seeds under a net.Papaver somniferum (Papaveraceae).--Thirty capsules from uncoveredplants yielded 15.6 grains weight of seed, and thirty capsules fromcovered-up plants, growing in the same bed, yielded 16.5 grains weight;so that the latter plants were more productive than the uncovered.Professor H. Hoffmann ('Speciesfrage' 1875 page 53) also found thisspecies self-fertile when protected from insects.Papaver vagum.--Produced late in the summer plenty of seeds, whichgerminated well.Papaver argemonoides.--According to Hildebrand ('Jahrbuch fur w. Bot.'B.7 page 466), spontaneously self-fertilised flowers are by no meanssterile.Glaucium luteum (Papaveraceae).--According to Hildebrand ('Jahrbuch furw. Bot.' B.7 page 466), spontaneously self-fertilised flowers are by nomeans sterile.Argemone ochroleuca (Papaveraceae).--According to Hildebrand ('Jahrbuchfur w. Bot.' B.7 page 466), spontaneously self-fertilised flowers are byno means sterile.Adlumia cirrhosa (Fumariaceae).--Sets an abundance of capsules.Hypecoum procumbens (Fumariaceae).--Hildebrand says (idem), with respectto protected flowers, that "eine gute Fruchtbildung eintrete."Fumaria officinalis (Fumariaceae).--Covered-up and unprotected plantsapparently produced an equal number of capsules, and the seeds of theformer seemed to the eye equally good. I have often watched this plant,and so has Hildebrand, and we have never seen an insect visit theflowers. Hermann Muller has likewise been struck with the rarity of thevisits of insects to it, though he has sometimes seen hive-bees at work.The flowers may perhaps be visited by small moths, as is probably thecase with the following species.Fumaria capreolata.--Several large beds of this plant growing wild werewatched by me during many days, but the flowers were never visited byany insects, though a humble-bee was once seen closely to inspect them.Nevertheless, as the nectary contains much nectar, especially in theevening, I felt convinced that they were visited, probably by moths. Thepetals do not naturally separate or open in the least; but they had beenopened by some means in a certain proportion of the flowers, in the samemanner as follows when a thick bristle is pushed into the nectary; sothat in this respect they resemble the flowers of Corydalis lutea.Thirty-four heads, each including many flowers, were examined, andtwenty of them had from one to four flowers, whilst fourteen had not asingle flower thus opened. It is therefore clear that some of theflowers had been visited by insects, while the majority had not; yetalmost all produced capsules.Linum usitatissimum (Linaceae).--Appears to be quite fertile. H.Hoffmann 'Botanische Zeitung' 1876 page 566.Impatiens barbigerum (Balsaminaceae).--The flowers, though excellentlyadapted for cross-fertilisation by the bees which freely visit them, setabundantly under a net.Impatiens noli-me-tangere (Balsaminaceae).--This species producescleistogene and perfect flowers. A plant was covered with a net, andsome perfect flowers, marked with threads, produced eleven spontaneouslyself-fertilised capsules, which contained on an average 3.45 seeds. Ineglected to ascertain the number of seeds produced by perfect flowersexposed to the visits of insects, but I believe it is not greatly inexcess of the above average. Mr. A.W. Bennett has carefully describedthe structure of the flowers of I. fulva in 'Journal of the LinneanSociety' volume 13 Bot. 1872 page 147. This latter species is said to besterile with its own pollen ('Gardeners' Chronicle' 1868 page 1286), andif so, it presents a remarkable contrast with I. barbigerum andnoli-me-tangere.Limnanthes douglasii (Geraniaceae).--Highly fertile.Viscaria oculata (Caryophyllaceae).--Produces plenty of capsules withgood seeds.Stellaria media (Caryophyllaceae).--Covered-up and uncovered plantsproduced an equal number of capsules, and the seeds in both appearedequally numerous and good.Beta vulgaris (Chenopodiaceae).--Highly self-fertile.Vicia sativa (Leguminosae).--Protected and unprotected plants producedan equal number of pods and equally fine seeds. If there was anydifference between the two lots, the covered-up plants were the mostproductive.Vicia hirsuta.--This species bears the smallest flowers of any Britishleguminous plant. The result of covering up plants was exactly the sameas in the last species.Pisum sativum (Leguminosae).--Fully fertile.Lathyrus odoratus (Leguminosae).--Fully fertile.Lathyrus nissolia.--Fully fertile.Lupinus luteus (Leguminosae).--Fairly productive.Lupinus pilosus.--Produced plenty of pods.Ononis minutissima (Leguminosae).--Twelve perfect flowers on a plantunder a net were marked by threads, and produced eight pods, containingon an average 2.38 seeds. Pods produced by flowers visited by insectswould probably have contained on an average 3.66 seeds, judging from theeffects of artificial cross-fertilisation.Phaseolus vulgaris (Leguminosae).--Quite fertile.Trifolium arvense (Leguminosae).--The excessively small flowers areincessantly visited by hive and humble-bees. When insects were excludedthe flower-heads seemed to produce as many and as fine seeds as theexposed heads.Trifolium procumbens.--On one occasion covered-up plants seemed to yieldas many seeds as the uncovered. On a second occasion sixty uncoveredflower-heads yielded 9.1 grains weight of seeds, whilst sixty heads onprotected plants yielded no less than 17.7 grains; so that these latterplants were much more productive; but this result I suppose wasaccidental. I have often watched this plant, and have never seen theflowers visited by insects; but I suspect that the flowers of thisspecies, and more especially of Trifolium minus, are frequented by smallnocturnal moths which, as I hear from Mr. Bond, haunt the smallerclovers.Medicago lupulina (Leguminosae).--On account of the danger of losing theseeds, I was forced to gather the pods before they were quite ripe; 150flower-heads on plants visited by bees yielded pods weighing 101 grains;whilst 150 heads on protected plants yielded pods weighing 77 grains.The inequality would probably have been greater if the mature seedscould have been all safely collected and compared. Ig. Urban (Keimung,Bluthen, etc., bei Medicago 1873) has described the means offertilisation in this genus, as has the Reverend G. Henslow in the'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 9 1866 pages 327 and 355.Nicotiana tabacum (Solanaceae).--Fully self-fertile.Ipomoea purpurea (Convolvulaceae).--Highly self-fertile.Leptosiphon androsaceus (Polemoniacae).--Plants under a net produced agood many capsules.Primula mollis (Primulaceae).--A non-dimorphic species, self-fertile: J.Scott, in 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864 page120.Nolana prostrata (Nolanaceae).--Plants covered up in the greenhouse,yielded seeds by weight compared with uncovered plants, the flowers ofwhich were visited by many bees, in the ratio of 100 to 61.Ajuga reptans (Labiatae).--Set a good many seeds; but none of the stemsunder a net produced so many as several uncovered stems growing closelyby.Euphrasia officinalis (Scrophulariaceae).--Covered-up plants producedplenty of seed; whether less than the exposed plants I cannot say. I sawtwo small Dipterous insects (Dolichopos nigripennis and Empis chioptera)repeatedly sucking the flowers; as they crawled into them, they rubbedagainst the bristles which project from the anthers, and became dustedwith pollen.Veronica agrestis (Scrophulariaceae).--Covered-up plants produced anabundance of seeds. I do not know whether any insects visit the flowers;but I have observed Syrphidae repeatedly covered with pollen visitingthe flowers of V. hederaefolia and chamoedrys.Mimulus luteus (Scrophulariaceae).--Highly self-fertile.Calceolaria (greenhouse variety) (Scrophulariaceae).--Highlyself-fertile.Verbascum thapsus (Scrophulariaceae).--Highly self-fertile.Verbascum lychnitis.--Highly self-fertile.Vandellia nummularifolia (Scrophulariaceae).--Perfect flowers produce agood many capsules.Bartsia odontites (Scrophulariaceae).--Covered-up plants produced a goodmany seeds; but several of these were shrivelled, nor were they sonumerous as those produced by unprotected plants, which were incessantlyvisited by hive and humble-bees.Specularia speculum (Lobeliaceae).--Covered plants produced almost asmany capsules as the uncovered.Lactuca sativa (Compositae).--Covered plants produced some seeds, butthe summer was wet and unfavourable.Galium aparine (Rubiaceae).--Covered plants produced quite as many seedsas the uncovered.Apium petroselinum (Umbelliferae).--Covered plants apparently were asproductive as the uncovered.Zea mays (Gramineae).--A single plant in the greenhouse produced a goodmany grains.Canna warscewiczi (Marantaceae).--Highly self-fertile.Orchidaceae.--In Europe Ophrys apifera is as regularly self-fertilisedas is any cleistogene flower. In the United States, South Africa, andAustralia there are a few species which are perfectly self-fertile.These several cases are given in the second edition of my work on theFertilisation of Orchids.Allium cepa (blood red var.) (Liliaceae).--Four flower-heads werecovered with a net, and they produced somewhat fewer and smallercapsules than those on the uncovered heads. The capsules were counted onone uncovered head, and were 289 in number; whilst those on a fine headfrom under the net were only 199.]Each of these lists contains by a mere accident the same number ofgenera, namely, forty-nine. The genera in the first list includesixty-five species, and those in the second sixty species; the Orchideaein both being excluded. If the genera in this latter order, as well asin the Asclepiadae and Apocynaceae, had been included, the number ofspecies which are sterile if insects are excluded would have beengreatly increased; but the lists are confined to species which wereactually experimented on. The results can be considered as onlyapproximately accurate, for fertility is so variable a character, thateach species ought to have been tried many times. The above number ofspecies, namely, 125, is as nothing to the host of living plants; butthe mere fact of more than half of them being sterile within thespecified degree, when insects are excluded, is a striking one; forwhenever pollen has to be carried from the anthers to the stigma inorder to ensure full fertility, there is at least a good chance ofcross-fertilisation. I do not, however, believe that if all known plantswere tried in the same manner, half would be found to be sterile withinthe specified limits; for many flowers were selected for experimentwhich presented some remarkable structure; and such flowers oftenrequire insect-aid. Thus out of the forty-nine genera in the first list,about thirty-two have flowers which are asymmetrical or present someremarkable peculiarity; whilst in the second list, including specieswhich are fully or moderately fertile when insects were excluded, onlyabout twenty-one out of the forty-nine are asymmetrical or present anyremarkable peculiarity.MEANS OF CROSS-FERTILISATION.The most important of all the means by which pollen is carried from theanthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from flower to flower, areinsects, belonging to the orders of Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, andDiptera; and in some parts of the world, birds. (10/1. I will here giveall the cases known to me of birds fertilising flowers. In South Brazil,humming-birds certainly fertilise the various species of Abutilon, whichare sterile without their aid (Fritz Muller 'Jenaische Zeitschrift f.Naturwiss.' B. 7 1872 page 24.) Long-beaked humming-birds visit theflowers of Brugmansia, whilst some of the short-beaked species oftenpenetrate its large corolla in order to obtain the nectar in anillegitimate manner, in the same manner as do bees in all parts of theworld. It appears, indeed, that the beaks of humming-birds are speciallyadapted to the various kinds of flowers which they visit: on theCordillera they suck the Salviae, and lacerate the flowers of theTacsoniae; in Nicaragua, Mr. Belt saw them sucking the flowers ofMarcgravia and Erythina, and thus they carried pollen from flower toflower. In North America they are said to frequent the flowers ofImpatiens: (Gould 'Introduction to the Trochilidae' 1861 pages 15, 120;'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1869 page 389; 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' page129; 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 13 1872 page 151.) Imay add that I often saw in Chile a Mimus with its head yellow withpollen from, as I believe, a Cassia. I have been assured that at theCape of Good Hope, Strelitzia is fertilised by the Nectarinidae. Therecan hardly be a doubt that many Australian flowers are fertilised by themany honey-sucking birds of that country. Mr. Wallace remarks (addressto the Biological Section, British Association 1876) that he has "oftenobserved the beaks and faces of the brush-tongued lories of the Moluccascovered with pollen." In New Zealand, many specimens of the Anthornismelanura had their heads coloured with pollen from the flowers of anendemic species of Fuchsia (Potts 'Transactions of the New ZealandInstitute' volume 3 1870 page 72.) Next in importance, but in a quitesubordinate degree, is the wind; and with some aquatic plants, accordingto Delpino, currents of water. The simple fact of the necessity in manycases of extraneous aid for the transport of the pollen, and the manycontrivances for this purpose, render it highly probable that some greatbenefit is thus gained; and this conclusion has now been firmlyestablished by the proved superiority in growth, vigour, and fertilityof plants of crossed parentage over those of self-fertilised parentage.But we should always keep in mind that two somewhat opposed ends have tobe gained; the first and more important one being the production ofseeds by any means, and the second, cross-fertilisation.The advantages derived from cross-fertilisation throw a flood of lighton most of the chief characters of flowers. We can thus understand theirlarge size and bright colours, and in some cases the bright tints of theadjoining parts, such as the peduncles, bracteae, etc. By this meansthey are rendered conspicuous to insects, on the same principle thatalmost every fruit which is devoured by birds presents a strong contrastin colour with the green foliage, in order that it may be seen, and itsseeds freely disseminated. With some flowers conspicuousness is gainedat the expense even of the reproductive organs, as with the ray-floretsof many Compositae, the exterior flowers of Hydrangea, and the terminalflowers of the Feather-hyacinth or Muscari. There is also reason tobelieve, and this was the opinion of Sprengel, that flowers differ incolour in accordance with the kinds of insects which frequent them.Not only do the bright colours of flowers serve to attract insects, butdark-coloured streaks and marks are often present, which Sprengel longago maintained served as guides to the nectary. These marks follow theveins in the petals, or lie between them. They may occur on only one, oron all excepting one or more of the upper or lower petals; or they mayform a dark ring round the tubular part of the corolla, or be confinedto the lips of an irregular flower. In the white varieties of manyflowers, such as of Digitalis purpurea, Antirrhinum majus, severalspecies of Dianthus, Phlox, Myosotis, Rhododendron, Pelargonium, Primulaand Petunia, the marks generally persist, whilst the rest of the corollahas become of a pure white; but this may be due merely to their colourbeing more intense and thus less readily obliterated. Sprengel's notionof the use of these marks as guides appeared to me for a long timefanciful; for insects, without such aid, readily discover and bite holesthrough the nectary from the outside. They also discover the minutenectar-secreting glands on the stipules and leaves of certain plants.Moreover, some few plants, such as certain poppies, which are notnectariferous, have guiding marks; but we might perhaps expect that somefew plants would retain traces of a former nectariferous condition. Onthe other hand, these marks are much more common on asymmetricalflowers, the entrance into which would be apt to puzzle insects, than onregular flowers. Sir J. Lubbock has also proved that bees readilydistinguish colours, and that they lose much time if the position ofhoney which they have once visited be in the least changed. (10/2.'British Wild Flowers in relation to Insects' 1875 page 44.) Thefollowing case affords, I think, the best evidence that these marks havereally been developed in correlation with the nectary. The two upperpetals of the common Pelargonium are thus marked near their bases; and Ihave repeatedly observed that when the flowers vary so as to becomepeloric or regular, they lose their nectaries and at the same time thedark marks. When the nectary is only partially aborted, only one of theupper petals loses its mark. Therefore the nectary and these marksclearly stand in some sort of close relation to one another; and thesimplest view is that they were developed together for a specialpurpose; the only conceivable one being that the marks serve as a guideto the nectary. It is, however, evident from what has been already said,that insects could discover the nectar without the aid of guiding marks.They are of service to the plant, only by aiding insects to visit andsuck a greater number of flowers within a given time than wouldotherwise be possible; and thus there will be a better chance offertilisation by pollen brought from a distinct plant, and this we knowis of paramount importance.The odours emitted by flowers attract insects, as I have observed in thecase of plants covered by a muslin net. Nageli affixed artificialflowers to branches, scenting some with essential oils and leavingothers unscented; and insects were attracted to the former in anunmistakable manner. (10/3. 'Enstehung etc. der Naturhist. Art.' 1865page 23.) Not a few flowers are both conspicuous and odoriferous. Of allcolours, white is the prevailing one; and of white flowers aconsiderably larger proportion smell sweetly than of any other colour,namely, 14.6 per cent; of red, only 8.2 per cent are odoriferous. (10/4.The colours and odours of the flowers of 4200 species have beentabulated by Landgrabe and by Schubler and Kohler. I have not seen theiroriginal works, but a very full abstract is given in Loudon's'Gardeners' Magazine' volume 13 1837 page 367.) The fact of a largerproportion of white flowers smelling sweetly may depend in part on thosewhich are fertilised by moths requiring the double aid ofconspicuousness in the dusk and of odour. So great is the economy ofnature, that most flowers which are fertilised by crepuscular ornocturnal insects emit their odour chiefly or exclusively in theevening. Some flowers, however, which are highly odoriferous dependsolely on this quality for their fertilisation, such as thenight-flowering stock (Hesperis) and some species of Daphne; and thesepresent the rare case of flowers which are fertilised by insects beingobscurely coloured.The storage of a supply of nectar in a protected place is manifestlyconnected with the visits of insects. So is the position which thestamens and pistils occupy, either permanently or at the proper periodthrough their own movements; for when mature they invariably stand inthe pathway leading to the nectary. The shape of the nectary and of theadjoining parts are likewise related to the particular kinds of insectswhich habitually visit the flowers; this has been well shown by HermannMuller by his comparison of lowland species which are chiefly visited bybees, with alpine species belonging to the same genera which are visitedby butterflies. (10/5. 'Nature' 1874 page 110, 1875 page 190, 1876 pages210, 289.) Flowers may also be adapted to certain kinds of insects, bysecreting nectar particularly attractive to them, and unattractive toother kinds; of which fact Epipactis latifolia offers the most strikinginstance known to me, as it is visited exclusively by wasps. Structuresalso exist, such as the hairs within the corolla of the fox glove(Digitalis), which apparently serve to exclude insects that are not wellfitted to bring pollen from one flower to another. (10/6. Belt 'TheNaturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 132.) I need say nothing here of theendless contrivances, such as the viscid glands attached to thepollen-masses of the Orchideae and Asclepiadae, or the viscid orroughened state of the pollen-grains of many plants, or the irritabilityof their stamens which move when touched by insects etc.--as all thesecontrivances evidently favour or ensure cross-fertilisation.All ordinary flowers are so far open that insects can force an entranceinto them, notwithstanding that some, like the Snapdragon (Antirrhinum),various Papilionaceous and Fumariaceous flowers, are in appearanceclosed. It cannot be maintained that their openness is necessary forfertility, as cleistogene flowers which are permanently closed yield afull complement of seeds. Pollen contains much nitrogen andphosphorus--the two most precious of all the elements for the growth ofplants--but in the case of most open flowers, a large quantity of pollenis consumed by pollen-devouring insects, and a large quantity isdestroyed during long-continued rain. With many plants this latter evilis guarded against, as far as is possible, by the anthers opening onlyduring dry weather (10/7. Mr. Blackley observed that the ripe anthers ofrye did not dehisce whilst kept under a bell-glass in a damp atmosphere,whilst other anthers exposed to the same temperature in the open airdehisced freely. He also found much more pollen adhering to the stickyslides, which were attached to kites and sent high up in the atmosphere,during the first fine and dry days after wet weather, than at othertimes: 'Experimental Researches on Hay Fever' 1873 page 127.)--by theposition and form of some or all of the petals,--by the presence ofhairs, etc., and as Kerner has shown in his interesting essay, by themovements of the petals or of the whole flower during cold and wetweather. (10/8. 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873.) In order tocompensate the loss of pollen in so many ways, the anthers produce a farlarger amount than is necessary for the fertilisation of the sameflower. I know this from my own experiments on Ipomoea, given in theIntroduction; and it is still more plainly shown by the astonishinglysmall quantity produced by cleistogene flowers, which lose none of theirpollen, in comparison with that produced by the open flowers borne bythe same plants; and yet this small quantity suffices for thefertilisation of all their numerous seeds. Mr. Hassall took pains inestimating the number of pollen-grains produced by a flower of theDandelion (Leontodon), and found the number to be 243,600, and in aPaeony 3,654,000 grains. (10/9. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History'volume 8 1842 page 108.) The editor of the 'Botanical Register' countedthe ovules in the flowers of Wistaria sinensis, and carefully estimatedthe number of pollen-grains, and he found that for each ovule there were7000 grains. (10/10. Quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1846 page 771.)With Mirabilis, three or four of the very large pollen-grains aresufficient to fertilise an ovule; but I do not know how many grains aflower produces. With Hibiscus, Kolreuter found that sixty grains werenecessary to fertilise all the ovules of a flower, and he calculatedthat 4863 grains were produced by a single flower, or eighty-one timestoo many. With Geum urbanum, however, according to Gartner, the pollenis only ten times too much. (10/11. Kolreuter 'Vorlaufige Nachricht'1761 page 9. Gartner 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. page 346.) As we thussee that the open state of all ordinary flowers, and the consequent lossof much pollen, necessitate the development of so prodigious an excessof this precious substance, why, it may be asked, are flowers alwaysleft open? As many plants exist throughout the vegetable kingdom whichbear cleistogene flowers, there can hardly be a doubt that all openflowers might easily have been converted into closed ones. The graduatedsteps by which this process could have been effected may be seen at thepresent time in Lathyrus nissolia, Biophytum sensitivum, and severalother plants. The answer to the above question obviously is, that withpermanently closed flowers there could be no cross-fertilisation.The frequency, almost regularity, with which pollen is transported byinsects from flower to flower, often from a considerable distance, welldeserves attention. (10/12. An experiment made by Kolreuter 'Forsetsung'etc. 1763 page 69, affords good evidence on this head. Hibiscusvesicarius is strongly dichogamous, its pollen being shed before thestigmas are mature. Kolreuter marked 310 flowers, and put pollen fromother flowers on their stigmas every day, so that they were thoroughlyfertilised; and he left the same number of other flowers to the agencyof insects. Afterwards he counted the seeds of both lots: the flowerswhich he had fertilised with such astonishing care produced 11,237seeds, whilst those left to the insects produced 10,886; that is, a lessnumber by only 351; and this small inferiority is fully accounted for bythe insects not having worked during some days, when the weather wascold with continued rain.) This is best shown by the impossibility inmany cases of raising two varieties of the same species pure, if theygrow at all near together; but to this subject I shall presently return;also by the many cases of hybrids which have appeared spontaneously bothin gardens and a state of nature. With respect to the distance fromwhich pollen is often brought, no one who has had any experience wouldexpect to obtain pure cabbage-seed, for instance, if a plant of anothervariety grew within two or three hundred yards. An accurate observer,the late Mr. Masters of Canterbury, assured me that he once had hiswhole stock of seeds "seriously affected with purple bastards," by someplants of purple kale which flowered in a cottager's garden at thedistance of half a mile; no other plant of this variety growing anynearer. (10/13. Mr. W.C. Marshall caught no less than seven specimens ofa moth (Cucullia umbratica) with the pollinia of the butterfly-orchis(Habenaria chlorantha) sticking to their eyes, and, therefore, in theproper position for fertilising the flowers of this species, on anisland in Derwentwater, at the distance of half a mile from any placewhere this plant grew: 'Nature' 1872 page 393.) But the most strikingcase which has been recorded is that by M. Godron, who shows by thenature of the hybrids produced that Primula grandiflora must have beencrossed with pollen brought by bees from P. officinalis, growing at thedistance of above two kilometres, or of about one English mile and aquarter. (10/14. 'Revue des Sc. Nat.' 1875 page 331.)All those who have long attended to hybridisation, insist in thestrongest terms on the liability of castrated flowers to be fertilisedby pollen brought from distant plants of the same species. (10/15. See,for instance, the remarks by Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' 1837 page 349.Also Gartner's strong expressions on this subject in his'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 670 and 'Kenntniss der Befruchtung' 1844pages 510, 573. Also Lecoq 'De la Fecondation' etc. 1845 page 27. Somestatements have been published during late years of the extraordinarytendency of hybrid plants to revert to their parent forms; but as it isnot said how the flowers were protected from insects, it may besuspected that they were often fertilised with pollen brought from adistance from the parent-species.) The following case shows this in theclearest manner: Gartner, before he had gained much experience,castrated and fertilised 520 flowers on various species with pollen ofother genera or other species, but left them unprotected; for, as hesays, he thought it a laughable idea that pollen should be brought fromflowers of the same species, none of which grew nearer than between 500and 600 yards. (10/16. 'Kenntniss der Befruchtung' pages 539, 550, 575,576.) The result was that 289 of these 520 flowers yielded no seed, ornone that germinated; the seed of 29 flowers produced hybrids, such asmight have been expected from the nature of the pollen employed; andlastly, the seed of the remaining 202 flowers produced perfectly pureplants, so that these flowers must have been fertilised by pollenbrought by insects from a distance of between 500 and 600 yards. (10/17.Henschel's experiments quoted by Gartner 'Kenntniss' etc. page 574,which are worthless in all other respects, likewise show how largelyflowers are intercrossed by insects. He castrated many flowers onthirty-seven species, belonging to twenty-two genera, and put on theirstigmas either no pollen, or pollen from distinct genera, yet they allseeded, and all the seedlings raised from them were of course pure.) Itis of course possible that some of these 202 flowers might have beenfertilised by pollen left accidentally in them when they were castrated;but to show how improbable this is, I may add that Gartner, during thenext eighteen years, castrated no less than 8042 flowers and hybridisedthem in a closed room; and the seeds from only seventy of these, that isconsiderably less than 1 per cent, produced pure or unhybridisedoffspring. (10/18. 'Kenntniss' etc. pages 555, 576.)From the various facts now given, it is evident that most flowers areadapted in an admirable manner for cross-fertilisation. Nevertheless,the greater number likewise present structures which are manifestlyadapted, though not in so striking a manner, for self-fertilisation. Thechief of these is their hermaphrodite condition; that is, theirincluding within the same corolla both the male and female reproductiveorgans. These often stand close together and are mature at the sametime; so that pollen from the same flower cannot fail to be deposited atthe proper period on the stigma. There are also various details ofstructure adapted for self-fertilisation. (10/19. Hermann Muller 'DieBefruchtung' etc. page 448.) Such structures are best shown in thosecurious cases discovered by Hermann Muller, in which a species existsunder two forms,--one bearing conspicuous flowers fitted forcross-fertilisation, and the other smaller flowers fitted forself-fertilisation, with many parts in the latter slightly modified forthis special purpose. (10/20. 'Nature' 1873 pages 44, 433.)As two objects in most respects opposed, namely, cross-fertilisation andself-fertilisation, have in many cases to be gained, we can understandthe co-existence in so many flowers of structures which appear at firstsight unnecessarily complex and of an opposed nature. We can thusunderstand the great contrast in structure between cleistogene flowers,which are adapted exclusively for self-fertilisation, and ordinaryflowers on the same plant, which are adapted so as to allow of at leastoccasional cross-fertilisation. (10/21. Fritz Muller has discovered inthe animal kingdom 'Jenaische Zeitschr.' B. 4 page 451, a case curiouslyanalogous to that of the plants which bear cleistogene and perfectflowers. He finds in the nests of termites in Brazil, males and femaleswith imperfect wings, which do not leave the nests and propagate thespecies in a cleistogene manner, but only if a fully-developed queenafter swarming does not enter the old nest. The fully-developed malesand females are winged, and individuals from distinct nests can hardlyfail often to intercross. In the act of swarming they are destroyed inalmost infinite numbers by a host of enemies, so that a queen may oftenfail to enter an old nest; and then the imperfectly developed males andfemales propagate and keep up the stock.) The former are always minute,completely closed, with their petals more or less rudimentary and neverbrightly coloured; they never secrete nectar, never are odoriferous,have very small anthers which produce only a few grains of pollen, andtheir stigmas are but little developed. Bearing in mind that someflowers are cross-fertilised by the wind (called anemophilous byDelpino), and others by insects (called entomophilous), we can furtherunderstand, as was pointed out by me several years ago, the greatcontrast in appearance between these two classes of flowers. (10/22.'Journal of the Linnean Society' volume 7 Botany 1863 page 77.)Anemophilous flowers resemble in many respects cleistogene flowers, butdiffer widely in not being closed, in producing an extraordinary amountof pollen which is always incoherent, and in the stigma often beinglargely developed or plumose. We certainly owe the beauty and odour ofour flowers and the storage of a large supply of honey to the existenceof insects.ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE AND CONSPICUOUSNESS OF FLOWERS,THE VISITS OF INSECTS, AND THE ADVANTAGES OF CROSS-FERTILISATION.It has already been shown that there is no close relation between thenumber of seeds produced by flowers when crossed and self-fertilised,and the degree to which their offspring are aaffected by the twoprocesses. I have also given reasons for believing that the inefficiencyof a plant's own pollen is in most cases an incidental result, or hasnot been specially acquired for the sake of preventingself-fertilisation. On the other hand, there can hardly be a doubt thatdichogamy, which prevails according to Hildebrand in the greater numberof species (10/23. 'Die Geschlecter Vertheiling' etc. page 32.),--thatthe heterostyled condition of certain plants,--and that many mechanicalstructures--have all been acquired so as both to checkself-fertilisation and to favour cross-fertilisation. The means forfavouring cross-fertilisation must have been acquired before those whichprevent self-fertilisation; as it would manifestly be injurious to aplant that its stigma should fail to receive its own pollen, unless ithad already become well adapted for receiving pollen from anotherindividual. It should be observed that many plants still possess a highpower of self-fertilisation, although their flowers are excellentlyconstructed for cross-fertilisation--for instance, those of manypapilionaceous species.It may be admitted as almost certain that some structures, such as anarrow elongated nectary, or a long tubular corolla, have been developedin order that certain kinds of insects alone should obtain the nectar.These insects would thus find a store of nectar preserved from theattacks of other insects; and they would thus be led to visit frequentlysuch flowers and to carry pollen from one to the other. (10/24. See theinteresting discussion on this subject by Hermann Muller, 'DieBefruchtung' etc. page 431.) It might perhaps have been expected thatplants having their flowers thus peculiarly constructed would profit ina greater degree by being crossed, than ordinary or simple flowers; butthis does not seem to hold good. Thus Tropaeolum minus has a longnectary and an irregular corolla, whilst Limnanthes douglasii has aregular flower and no proper nectary, yet the crossed seedlings of bothspecies are to the self-fertilised in height as 100 to 79. Salviacoccinea has an irregular corolla, with a curious apparatus by whichinsects depress the stamens, while the flowers of Ipomoea are regular;and the crossed seedlings of the former are in height to theself-fertilised as 100 to 76, whilst those of the Ipomoea are as 100 to77. Fagopyrum is dimorphic, and Anagallis collina is non-dimorphic, andthe crossed seedlings of both are in height to the self-fertilised as100 to 69.With all European plants, excepting the comparatively rare anemophilouskinds, the possibility of distinct individuals intercrossing depends onthe visits of insects; and Hermann Muller has proved by his valuableobservations, that large conspicuous flowers are visited much morefrequently and by many more kinds of insects, than are smallinconspicuous flowers. He further remarks that the flowers which arerarely visited must be capable of self-fertilisation, otherwise theywould quickly become extinct. (10/25. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 426.'Nature' 1873 page 433.) There is, however, some liability to error informing a judgment on this head, from the extreme difficulty ofascertaining whether flowers which are rarely or never visited duringthe day (as in the above given case of Fumaria capreolata) are notvisited by small nocturnal Lepidoptera, which are known to be stronglyattracted by sugar. (10/26. In answer to a question by me, the editor ofan entomological journal writes--"The Depressariae, as is notorious toevery collector of Noctuae, come very freely to sugar, and no doubtnaturally visit flowers:" the 'Entomologists' Weekly Intelligencer' 1860page 103.) The two lists given in the early part of this chapter supportMuller's conclusion that small and inconspicuous flowers are completelyself-fertile: for only eight or nine out of the 125 species in the twolists come under this head, and all of these were proved to be highlyfertile when insects were excluded. The singularly inconspicuous flowersof the Fly Ophrys (O. muscifera), as I have elsewhere shown, are rarelyvisited by insects; and it is a strange instance of imperfection, incontradiction to the above rule, that these flowers are notself-fertile, so that a large proportion of them do not produce seeds.The converse of the rule that plants bearing small and inconspicuousflowers are self-fertile, namely, that plants with large and conspicuousflowers are self-sterile, is far from true, as may be seen in our secondlist of spontaneously self-fertile species; for this list includes suchspecies as Ipomoea purpurea, Adonis aestivalis, Verbascum thapsus, Pisumsativum, Lathyrus odoratus, some species of Papaver and of Nymphaea, andothers.The rarity of the visits of insects to small flowers, does not dependaltogether on their inconspicuousness, but likewise on the absence ofsome sufficient attraction; for the flowers of Trifolium arvense areextremely small, yet are incessantly visited by hive and humble-bees, asare the small and dingy flowers of the asparagus. The flowers of Linariacymbalaria are small and not very conspicuous, yet at the proper timethey are freely visited by hive-bees. I may add that, according to Mr.Bennett, there is another and quite distinct class of plants whichcannot be much frequented by insects, as they flower either exclusivelyor often during the winter, and these seem adapted forself-fertilisation, as they shed their pollen before the flowers expand.(10/27. 'Nature' 1869 page 11.)That many flowers have been rendered conspicuous for the sake of guidinginsects to them is highly probable or almost certain; but it may beasked, have other flowers been rendered inconspicuous so that they maynot be frequently visited, or have they merely retained a former andprimitive condition? If a plant were much reduced in size, so probablywould be the flowers through correlated growth, and this may possiblyaccount for some cases; but the size and colour of the corolla are bothextremely variable characters, and it can hardly be doubted that iflarge and brightly-coloured flowers were advantageous to any species,these could be acquired through natural selection within a moderatelapse of time, as indeed we see with most alpine plants. Papilionaceousflowers are manifestly constructed in relation to the visits of insects,and it seems improbable, from the usual character of the group, that theprogenitors of the genera Vicia and Trifolium produced such minute andunattractive flowers as those of V. hirsuta and T. procumbens. We arethus led to infer that some plants either have not had their flowersincreased in size, or have actually had them reduced and purposelyrendered inconspicuous, so that they are now but little visited byinsects. In either case they must also have acquired or retained a highdegree of self-fertility.If it became from any cause advantageous to a species to have itscapacity for self-fertilisation increased, there is little difficulty inbelieving that this could readily be effected; for three cases of plantsvarying in such a manner as to be more fertile with their own pollenthan they originally were, occurred in the course of my few experiments,namely, with Mimulus, Ipomoea, and Nicotiana. Nor is there any reason todoubt that many kinds of plants are capable under favourablecircumstances of propagating themselves for very many generations byself-fertilisation. This is the case with the varieties of Pisum sativumand of Lathyrus odoratus which are cultivated in England, and withOphrys apifera and some other plants in a state of nature. Nevertheless,most or all of these plants retain structures in an efficient statewhich cannot be of the least use excepting for cross-fertilisation. Wehave also seen reason to suspect that self-fertilisation is in somepeculiar manner beneficial to certain plants; but if this be really thecase, the benefit thus derived is far more than counter-balanced by across with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety.Notwithstanding the several considerations just advanced, it seems to mehighly improbable that plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowershave been or should continue to be subjected to self-fertilisation for along series of generations. I think so, not from the evil whichmanifestly follows from self-fertilisation, in many cases even in thefirst generation, as with Viola tricolor, Sarothamnus, Nemophila,Cyclamen, etc.; nor from the probability of the evil increasing afterseveral generations, for on this latter head I have not sufficientevidence, owing to the manner in which my experiments were conducted.But if plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowers were notoccasionally intercrossed, and did not profit by the process, all theirflowers would probably have been rendered cleistogene, as they wouldthus have largely benefited by having to produce only a small quantityof safely-protected pollen. In coming to this conclusion, I have beenguided by the frequency with which plants belonging to distinct ordershave been rendered cleistogene. But I can hear of no instance of aspecies with all its flowers rendered permanently cleistogene. Leersiamakes the nearest approach to this state; but as already stated, it hasbeen known to produce perfect flowers in one part of Germany. Some otherplants of the cleistogene class, for instance Aspicarpa, have failed toproduce perfect flowers during several years in a hothouse; but it doesnot follow that they would fail to do so in their native country, anymore than with Vandellia, which with me produced only cleistogeneflowers during certain years. Plants belonging to this class commonlybear both kinds of flowers every season, and the perfect flowers ofViola canina yield fine capsules, but only when visited by bees. We havealso seen that the seedlings of Ononis minutissima, raised from theperfect flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant, were finerthan those from self-fertilised flowers; and this was likewise the caseto a certain extent with Vandellia. As therefore no species which at onetime bore small and inconspicuous flowers has had all its flowersrendered cleistogene, I must believe that plants now bearing small andinconspicuous flowers profit by their still remaining open, so as to beoccasionally intercrossed by insects. It has been one of the greatestoversights in my work that I did not experimentise on such flowers,owing to the difficulty of fertilising them, and to my not having seenthe importance of the subject. (10/28. Some of the species of Solanumwould be good ones for such experiments, for they are said by HermannMuller 'Befruchtung' page 434, to be unattractive to insects from notsecreting nectar, not producing much pollen, and not being veryconspicuous. Hence probably it is that, according to Verlot 'Productiondes Varieties' 1865 page 72, the varieties of "les aubergines et lestomates" (species of Solanum) do not intercross when they are cultivatednear together; but it should be remembered that these are not endemicspecies. On the other hand, the flowers of the common potato (S.tuberosum), though they do not secrete nectar Kurr 'Bedeutung derNektarien' 1833 page 40, yet cannot be considered as inconspicuous, andthey are sometimes visited by diptera (Muller), and, as I have seen, byhumble-bees. Tinzmann (as quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1846 page183, found that some of the varieties did not bear seed when fertilisedwith pollen from the same variety, but were fertile with that fromanother variety.)It should be remembered that in two of the cases in which highlyself-fertile varieties appeared amongst my experimental plants, namely,with Mimulus and Nicotiana, such varieties were greatly benefited by across with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety; and thislikewise was the case with the cultivated varieties of Pisum sativum andLathyrus odoratus, which have been long propagated byself-fertilisation. Therefore until the contrary is distinctly proved, Imust believe that as a general rule small and inconspicuous flowers areoccasionally intercrossed by insects; and that after long-continuedself-fertilisation, if they are crossed with pollen brought from a plantgrowing under somewhat different conditions, or descended from one thusgrowing, their offspring would profit greatly. It cannot be admitted,under our present state of knowledge, that self-fertilisation continuedduring many successive generations is ever the most beneficial method ofreproduction.THE MEANS WHICH FAVOUR OR ENSURE FLOWERS BEING FERTILISED WITH POLLENFROM A DISTINCT PLANT.We have seen in four cases that seedlings raised from a cross betweenflowers on the same plant, even on plants appearing distinct from havingbeen propagated by stolons or cuttings, were not superior to seedlingsfrom self-fertilised flowers; and in a fifth case (Digitalis) superioronly in a slight degree. Therefore we might expect that with plantsgrowing in a state of nature a cross between the flowers on distinctindividuals, and not merely between the flowers on the same plant, wouldgenerally or often be effected by some means. The fact of bees and ofsome Diptera visiting the flowers of the same species as long as theycan, instead of promiscuously visiting various species, favours theintercrossing of distinct plants. On the other hand, insects usuallysearch a large number of flowers on the same plant before they fly toanother, and this is opposed to cross-fertilisation. The extraordinarynumber of flowers which bees are able to search within a very shortspace of time, as will be shown in a future chapter, increases thechance of cross-fertilisation; as does the fact that they are not ableto perceive without entering a flower whether other bees have exhaustedthe nectar. For instance, Hermann Muller found that four-fifths of theflowers of Lamium album which a humble-bee visited had been alreadyexhausted of their nectar. (10/29. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 311.) Inorder that distinct plants should be intercrossed, it is of courseindispensable that two or more individuals should grow near one another;and this is generally the case. Thus A. de Candolle remarks that inascending a mountain the individuals of the same species do not commonlydisappear near its upper limit quite gradually, but rather abruptly.This fact can hardly be explained by the nature of the conditions, asthese graduate away in an insensible manner, and it probably depends inlarge part on vigorous seedlings being produced only as high up themountain as many individuals can subsist together.With respect to dioecious plants, distinct individuals must alwaysfertilise each other. With monoecious plants, as pollen has to becarried from flower to flower, there will always be a good chance of itsbeing carried from plant to plant. Delpino has also observed the curiousfact that certain individuals of the monoecious walnut (Juglans regia)are proterandrous, and others proterogynous, and these will reciprocallyfertilise each other. (10/30. 'Ult. Osservazioni' etc. part 2 fasc 2page 337.) So it is with the common nut (Corylus avellana) (10/31.'Nature' 1875 page 26.), and, what is more surprising, with some fewhermaphrodite plants, as observed by Hermann Muller. (10/32. 'DieBefruchtung' etc. pages 285, 339.) These latter plants cannot fail toact on each other like dimorphic or trimorphic species, in which theunion of two individuals is necessary for full and normal fertility.With ordinary hermaphrodite species, the expansion of only a few flowersat the same time is one of the simplest means for favouring theintercrossing of distinct individuals; but this would render the plantsless conspicuous to insects, unless the flowers were of large size, asin the case of several bulbous plants. Kerner thinks that it is for thisobject that the Australian Villarsia parnassifolia produces daily only asingle flower. (10/33. 'Die Schutzmittel' etc page 23.) Mr. Cheesemanalso remarks, that as certain Orchids in New Zealand which requireinsect-aid for their fertilisation bear only a single flower, distinctplants cannot fail to intercross. (10/34. 'Transactions of the NewZealand Institute' volume 5 1873 page 356.)Dichogamy, which prevails so extensively throughout the vegetablekingdom, much increases the chance of distinct individualsintercrossing. With proterandrous species, which are far more ccommonthan proterogynous, the young flowers are exclusively male in function,and the older ones exclusively female; and as bees habitually alight lowdown on the spikes of flowers in order to crawl upwards, they get dustedwith pollen from the uppermost flowers, which they carry to the stigmasof the lower and older flowers on the next spike which they visit. Thedegree to which distinct plants will thus be intercrossed depends on thenumber of spikes in full flower at the same time on the same plant. Withproterogynous flowers and with depending racemes, the manner in whichinsects visit the flowers ought to be reversed in order that distinctplants should be intercrossed. But this whole subject requires furtherinvestigation, as the great importance of crosses between distinctindividuals, instead of merely between distinct flowers, has hithertobeen hardly recognised.In some few cases the special movements of certain organs almost ensurepollen being carried from plant to plant. Thus with many orchids, thepollen-masses after becoming attached to the head or proboscis of aninsect do not move into the proper position for striking the stigma,until ample time has elapsed for the insect to fly to another plant.With Spiranthes autumnalis, the pollen-masses cannot be applied to thestigma until the labellum and rostellum have moved apart, and thismovement is very slow. (10/35. 'The Various Contrivances by whichBritish and Foreign Orchids are fertilised' first edition page 128.)With Posoqueria fragrans (one of the Rubiaceae) the same end is gainedby the movement of a specially constructed stamen, as described by FritzMuller.We now come to a far more general and therefore more important means bywhich the mutual fertilisation of distinct plants is effected, namely,the fertilising power of pollen from another variety or individual beinggreater than that of a plant's own pollen. The simplest and best knowncase of prepotent action in pollen, though it does not bear directly onour present subject, is that of a plant's own pollen over that from adistinct species. If pollen from a distinct species be placed on thestigma of a castrated flower, and then after the interval of severalhours, pollen from the same species be placed on the stigma, the effectsof the former are wholly obliterated, excepting in some rare cases. Iftwo varieties are treated in the same manner, the result is analogous,though of directly opposite nature; for pollen from any other variety isoften or generally prepotent over that from the same flower. I will givesome instances: the pollen of Mimulus luteus regularly falls on thestigma of its own flower, for the plant is highly fertile when insectsare excluded. Now several flowers on a remarkably constant whitishvariety were fertilised without being castrated with pollen from ayellowish variety; and of the twenty-eight seedlings thus raised, everyone bore yellowish flowers, so that the pollen of the yellow varietycompletely overwhelmed that of the mother-plant. Again, Iberis umbellatais spontaneously self-fertile, and I saw an abundance of pollen fromtheir own flowers on the stigmas; nevertheless, of thirty seedlingsraised from non-castrated fflowers of a crimson variety crossed withpollen from a pink variety, twenty-four bore pink flowers, like those ofthe male or pollen-bearing parent.In these two cases flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinctvariety, and this was shown to be prepotent by the character of theoffspring. Nearly similar results often follow when two or moreself-fertile varieties are allowed to grow near one another and arevisited by insects. The common cabbage produces a large number offlowers on the same stalk, and when insects are excluded these set manycapsules, moderately rich in seeds. I planted a white Kohl-rabi, apurple Kohl-rabi, a Portsmouth broccoli, a Brussels sprout, and aSugar-loaf cabbage near together and left them uncovered. Seedscollected from each kind were sown in separate beds; and the majority ofthe seedlings in all five beds were mongrelised in the most complicatedmanner, some taking more after one variety, and some after another. Theeffects of the Kohl-rabi were particularly plain in the enlarged stemsof many of the seedlings. Altogether 233 plants were raised, of which155 were mongrelised in the plainest manner, and of the remaining 78 nothalf were absolutely pure. I repeated the experiment by planting neartogether two varieties of cabbage with purple-green and white-greenlacinated leaves; and of the 325 seedlings raised from the purple-greenvariety, 165 had white-green and 160 purple-green leaves. Of the 466seedlings raised from the white-green variety, 220 had purple-green and246 white-green leaves. These cases show how largely pollen from aneighbouring variety of the cabbage effaces the action of the plant'sown pollen. We should bear in mind that pollen must be carried by thebees from flower to flower on the same large branching stem much moreabundantly than from plant to plant; and in the case of plants theflowers of which are in some degree dichogamous, those on the same stemwould be of different ages, and would thus be as ready for mutualfertilisation as the flowers on distinct plants, were it not for theprepotency of pollen from another variety. (10/36. A writer in the'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1855 page 730, says that he planted a bed ofturnips (Brassica rapa) and of rape (B. napus) close together, and sowedthe seeds of the former. The result was that scarcely one seedling wastrue to its kind, and several closely resembled rape.)Several varieties of the radish (Raphanus sativus), which is moderatelyself-fertile when insects are excluded, were in flower at the same timein my garden. Seed was collected from one of them, and out of twenty-twoseedlings thus raised only twelve were true to their kind. (10/37.Duhamel as quoted by Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 50, makes ananalogous statement with respect to this plant.)The onion produces a large number of flowers, all crowded together intoa large globular head, each flower having six stamens; so that thestigmas receive plenty of pollen from their own and the adjoininganthers. Consequently the plant is fairly self-fertile when protectedfrom insects. A blood-red, silver, globe and Spanish onion were plantednear together; and seedlings were raised from each kind in four separatebeds. In all the beds mongrels of various kinds were numerous, exceptamongst the ten seedlings from the blood-red onion, which included onlytwo. Altogether forty-six seedlings were raised, of which thirty-one hadbeen plainly crossed.A similar result is known to follow with the varieties of many otherplants, if allowed to flower near together: I refer here only to specieswhich are capable of fertilising themselves, for if this be not thecase, they would of course be liable to be crossed by any other varietygrowing near. Horticulturists do not commonly distinguish between theeffects of variability and intercrossing; but I have collected evidenceon the natural crossing of varieties of the tulip, hyacinth, anemone,ranunculus, strawberry, Leptosiphon androsaceus, orange, rhododendronand rhubarb, all of which plants I believe to be self-fertile. (10/38.With respect to tulips and some other flowers, see Godron 'De l'Espece'tome 1 page 252. For anemones 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1859 page 98. Forstrawberries see Herbert in 'Transactions of the Horticultural Society'volume 4 page 17. The same observer elsewhere speaks of the spontaneouscrossing of rhododendrons. Gallesio makes the same statement withrespect to oranges. I have myself known extensive crossing to occur withthe common rhubarb. For Leptosiphon, Verlot 'Des Varieties' 1865 page20. I have not included in my list the Carnation, Nemophila, orAntirrhinum, the varieties of which are known to cross freely, becausethese plants are not always self-fertile. I know nothing about theself-fertility of Trollius Lecoq 'De la Fecondation' 1862 page 93,Mahonia, and Crinum, in which genera the species intercross largely.With respect to Mahonia it is now scarcely possible to procure in thiscountry pure specimens of M. aquifolium or repens; and the variousspecies of Crinum sent by Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 32, to Calcutta,crossed there so freely that pure seed could not be saved.) Much otherindirect evidence could be given with respect to the extent to whichvarieties of the same species spontaneously intercross.Gardeners who raise seed for sale are compelled by dearly boughtexperience to take extraordinary precautions against intercrossing. ThusMessrs. Sharp "have land engaged in the growth of seed in no less thaneight parishes." The mere fact of a vast number of plants belonging tothe same variety growing together is a considerable protection, as thechances are strong in favour of plants of the same varietyintercrossing; and it is in chief part owing to this circumstance, thatcertain villages have become famous for pure seed of particularvarieties. (10/39. With respect to Messrs. Sharp see 'Gardeners'Chronicle' 1856 page 823. Lindley's 'Theory of Horticulture' page 319.)Only two trials were made by me to ascertain after how long an intervalof time, pollen from a distinct variety would obliterate more or lesscompletely the action of a plant's own pollen. The stigmas in two latelyexpanded flowers on a variety of cabbage, called Ragged Jack, were wellcovered with pollen from the same plant. After an interval oftwenty-three hours, pollen from the Early Barnes Cabbage growing at adistance was placed on both stigmas; and as the plant was leftuncovered, pollen from other flowers on the Ragged Jack would certainlyhave been left by the bees during the next two or three days on the sametwo stigmas. Under these circumstances it seemed very unlikely that thepollen of the Barnes cabbage would produce any effect; but three out ofthe fifteen plants raised from the two capsules thus produced wereplainly mongrelised: and I have no doubt that the twelve other plantswere affected, for they grew much more vigorously than theself-fertilised seedlings from the Ragged Jack planted at the same timeand under the same conditions. Secondly, I placed on several stigmas ofa long-styled cowslip (Primula veris) plenty of pollen from the sameplant, and after twenty-four hours added some from a short-styleddark-red Polyanthus, which is a variety of the cowslip. From the flowersthus treated thirty seedlings were raised, and all these withoutexception bore reddish flowers; so that the effect of the plant's ownpollen, though placed on the stigmas twenty-four hours previously, wasquite destroyed by that of the red variety. It should, however, beobserved that these plants are dimorphic, and that the second union wasa legitimate one, whilst the first was illegitimate; but flowersillegitimately fertilised with their own pollen yield a moderately fairsupply of seeds.We have hitherto considered only the prepotent fertilising power ofpollen from a distinct variety over a plants' own pollen,--both kinds ofpollen being placed on the same stigma. It is a much more remarkablefact that pollen from another individual of the same variety isprepotent over a plant's own pollen, as shown by the superiority of theseedlings raised from a cross of this kind over seedlings fromself-fertilised flowers. Thus in Tables 7/A, B, and C, there are atleast fifteen species which are self-fertile when insects are excluded;and this implies that their stigmas must receive their own pollen;nevertheless, most of the seedlings which were raised by fertilising thenon-castrated flowers of these fifteen species with pollen from anotherplant were greatly superior, in height, weight, and fertility, to theself-fertilised offspring. (10/40. These fifteen species consist ofBrassica oleracea, Reseda odorata and lutea, Limnanthes douglasii,Papaver vagum, Viscaria oculata, Beta vulgaris, Lupinus luteus, Ipomoeapurpurea, Mimulus luteus, Calceolaria, Verbascum thapsus, Vandellianummularifolia, Lactuca sativa, and Zea mays.) For instance, withIpomoea purpurea every single intercrossed plant exceeded in height itsself-fertilised opponent until the sixth generation; and so it was withMimulus luteus until the fourth generation. Out of six pairs of crossedand self-fertilised cabbages, every one of the former was much heavierthan the latter. With Papaver vagum, out of fifteen pairs, all but twoof the crossed plants were taller than their self-fertilised opponents.Of eight pairs of Lupinus luteus, all but two of the crossed weretaller; of eight pairs of Beta vulgaris all but one; and of fifteenpairs of Zea mays all but two were taller. Of fifteen pairs ofLimnanthes douglasii, and of seven pairs of Lactuca sativa, every singlecrossed plant was taller than its self-fertilised opponent. It shouldalso be observed that in these experiments no particular care was takento cross-fertilise the flowers immediately after their expansion; it istherefore almost certain that in many of these cases some pollen fromthe same flower will have already fallen on and acted on the stigma.There can hardly be a doubt that several other species of which thecrossed seedlings are more vigorous than the self-fertilised, as shownin Tables 7/A, 7/B and 7/C, besides the above fifteen, must havereceived their own pollen and that from another plant at nearly the sametime; and if so, the same remarks as those just given are applicable tothem. Scarcely any result from my experiments has surprised me so muchas this of the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over eachplant's own pollen, as proved by the greater constitutional vigour ofthe crossed seedlings. The evidence of prepotency is here deduced fromthe comparative growth of the two lots of seedlings; but we have similarevidence in many cases from the much greater fertility of thenon-castrated flowers on the mother-plant, when these received at thesame time their own pollen and that from a distinct plant, in comparisonwith the flowers which received only their own pollen.From the various facts now given on the spontaneous intercrossing ofvarieties growing near together, and on the effects of cross-fertilisingflowers which are self-fertile and have not been castrated, we mayconclude that pollen brought by insects or by the wind from a distinctplant will generally prevent the action of pollen from the same flower,even though it may have been applied some time before; and thus theintercrossing of plants in a state of nature will be greatly favoured orensured.The case of a great tree covered with innumerable hermaphrodite flowersseems at first sight strongly opposed to the belief in the frequency ofintercrosses between distinct individuals. The flowers which grow on theopposite sides of such a tree will have been exposed to somewhatdifferent conditions, and a cross between them may perhaps be in somedegree beneficial; but it is not probable that it would be nearly sobeneficial as a cross between flowers on distinct trees, as we may inferfrom the inefficiency of pollen taken from plants which have beenpropagated from the same stock, though growing on separate roots. Thenumber of bees which frequent certain kinds of trees when in full floweris very great, and they may be seen flying from tree to tree morefrequently than might have been expected. Nevertheless, if we considerhow numerous are the flowers, for instance, on a horse-chestnut orlime-tree, an incomparably larger number of flowers must be fertilisedby pollen brought from other flowers on the same tree, than from flowerson a distinct tree. But we should bear in mind that with thehorse-chestnut, for instance, only one or two of the several flowers onthe same peduncle produce a seed; and that this seed is the product ofonly one out of several ovules within the same ovarium. Now we know fromthe experiments of Herbert and others that if one flower is fertilisedwith pollen which is more efficient than that applied to the otherflowers on the same peduncle, the latter often drop off (10/41.'Variation under Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 page120.); and it is probable that this would occur with many of theself-fertilised flowers on a large tree, if other and adjoining flowerswere cross-fertilised. Of the flowers annually produced by a great tree,it is almost certain that a large number would be self-fertilised; andif we assume that the tree produced only 500 flowers, and that thisnumber of seeds were requisite to keep up the stock, so that at leastone seedling should hereafter struggle to maturity, then a largeproportion of the seedlings would necessarily be derived fromself-fertilised seeds. But if the tree annually produced 50,000 flowers,of which the self-fertilised dropped off without yielding seeds, thenthe cross-fertilised flowers might yield seeds in sufficient number tokeep up the stock, and most of the seedlings would be vigorous frombeing the product of a cross between distinct individuals. In thismanner the production of a vast number of flowers, besides serving toentice numerous insects and to compensate for the accidental destructionof many flowers by spring-frosts or otherwise, would be a very greatadvantage to the species; and when we behold our orchard-trees coveredwith a white sheet of bloom in the spring, we should not falsely accusenature of wasteful expenditure, though comparatively little fruit isproduced in the autumn.ANEMOPHILOUS PLANTS.The nature and relations of plants which are fertilised by the wind havebeen admirably discussed by Delpino and Hermann Muller; and I havealready made some remarks on the structure of their flowers in contrastwith those of entomophilous species. (10/42. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazionisulla Dicogamia' part 2 fasc. 1 1870 and 'Studi sopra un Lignaggioanemofilo' etc. 1871. Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 412,442. Both these authors remark that plants must have been anemophilousbefore they were entomophilous. Hermann Muller further discusses in avery interesting manner the steps by which entomophilous flowers becamenectariferous and gradually acquired their present structure throughsuccessive beneficial changes.) There is good reason to believe that thefirst plants which appeared on this earth were cryptogamic; and judgingfrom what now occurs, the male fertilising element must either havepossessed the power of spontaneous movement through the water or overdamp surfaces, or have been carried by currents of water to the femaleorgans. That some of the most ancient plants, such as ferns, possessedtrue sexual organs there can hardly be a doubt; and this shows, asHildebrand remarks, at how early a period the sexes were separated.(10/43. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' 1867 pages 84-90.) As soon asplants became phanerogamic and grew on the dry ground, if they were everto intercross, it would be indispensable that the male fertilisingelement should be transported by some means through the air; and thewind is the simplest means of transport. There must also have been aperiod when winged insects did not exist, and plants would not then havebeen rendered entomophilous. Even at a somewhat later period the morespecialised orders of the Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, whichare now chiefly concerned with the transport of pollen, did not exist.Therefore the earliest terrestrial plants known to us, namely, theConiferae and Cycadiae, no doubt were anemophilous, like the existingspecies of these same groups. A vestige of this early state of things islikewise shown by some other groups of plants which are anemophilous, asthese on the whole stand lower in the scale than entomophilous species.There is no great difficulty in understanding how an anemophilous plantmight have been rendered entomophilous. Pollen is a nutritioussubstance, and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects;and if any adhered to their bodies it would have been carried from theanthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from one flower to another.One of the chief characteristics of the pollen of anemophilous plants isits incoherence; but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodiesof insects, as we see with some Leguminosae, Ericaceae, andMelastomaceae. We have, however, better evidence of the possibility of atransition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilisedpartly by the wind and partly by insects. The common rhubarb (Rheumrhaponticum) is so far in an intermediate condition, that I have seenmany Diptera sucking the flowers, with much pollen adhering to theirbodies; and yet the pollen is so incoherent, that clouds of it areemitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day, some of whichcould hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouringflowers. According to Delpino and Hermann Muller, some species ofPlantago are in a similar intermediate condition. (10/44. 'DieBefruchtung' etc. page 342.)Although it is probable that pollen was aboriginally the sole attractionto insects, and although many plants now exist whose flowers arefrequented exclusively by pollen-devouring insects, yet the greatmajority secrete nectar as the chief attraction. Many years ago Isuggested that primarily the saccharine matter in nectar was excreted asa waste product of chemical changes in the sap; and that when theexcretion happened to occur within the envelopes of a flower, it wasutilised for the important object of cross-fertilisation, beingsubsequently much increased in quantity and stored in various ways.(10/45. Nectar was regarded by De Candolle and Dunal as an excretion, asstated by Martinet in 'Annal des Sc. Nat.' 1872 tome 14 page 211.) Thisview is rendered probable by the leaves of some trees excreting, undercertain climatic conditions, without the aid of special glands, asaccharine fluid, often called honey-dew. This is the case with theleaves of the lime; for although some authors have disputed the fact, amost capable judge, Dr. Maxwell Masters, informs me that, after havingheard the discussions on this subject before the Horticultural Society,he feels no doubt on this head. The leaves, as well as the cut stems, ofthe manna ash (Fraxinus ornus) secrete in a like manner saccharinematter. (10/46. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1876 page 242.) According toTreviranus, so do the upper surfaces of the leaves of Carduus arctioidesduring hot weather. Many analogous facts could be given. (10/47. Kurr'Untersuchungen uber die Bedeutung der Nektarien' 1833 page 115.) Thereare, however, a considerable number of plants which bear small glands ontheir leaves, petioles, phyllodia, stipules, bracteae, or flowerpeduncles, or on the outside of their calyx, and these glands secreteminute drops of a sweet fluid, which is eagerly sought by sugar-lovinginsects, such as ants, hive-bees, and wasps. (10/48. A large number ofcases are given by Delpino in the 'Bulletino Entomologico' Anno 6 1874.To these may be added those given in my text, as well as the excretionof saccharine matter from the calyx of two species of Iris, and from thebracteae of certain Orchideae: see Kurr 'Bedeutung der Nektarien' 1833pages 25, 28. Belt 'Nicaragua' page 224, also refers to a similarexcretion by many epiphytal orchids and passion-flowers. Mr. Rodgers hasseen much nectar secreted from the bases of the flower-peduncles ofVanilla. Link says that the only example of a hypopetalous nectary knownto him is externally at the base of the flowers of Chironia decussata:see 'Reports on Botany, Ray Society' 1846 page 355. An important memoirbearing on this subject has lately appeared by Reinke 'GottingenNachrichten' 1873 page 825, who shows that in many plants the tips ofthe serrations on the leaves in the bud bear glands which secrete onlyat a very early age, and which have the same morphological structure astrue nectar-secreting glands. He further shows that the nectar-secretingglands on the petioles of Prunus avium are not developed at a very earlyage, yet wither away on the old leaves. They are homologous with thoseon the serrations of the blades of the same leaves, as shown by theirstructure and by transition-forms; for the lowest serrations on theblades of most of the leaves secrete nectar instead of resin (harz).) Inthe case of the glands on the stipules of Vicia sativa, the excretionmanifestly depends on changes in the sap, consequent on the sun shiningbrightly; for I repeatedly observed that as soon as the sun was hiddenbehind clouds the secretion ceased, and the hive-bees left the field;but as soon as the sun broke out again, they returned to their feast.(10/49. I published a brief notice of this case in the 'Gardeners'Chronicle' 1855 July 21 page 487, and afterwards made furtherobservations. Besides the hive-bee, another species of bee, a moth,ants, and two kinds of flies sucked the drops of fluid on the stipules.The larger drops tasted sweet. The hive-bees never even looked at theflowers which were open at the same time; whilst two species ofhumble-bees neglected the stipules and visited only the flowers.) I haveobserved an analogous fact with the secretion of true nectar in theflowers of Lobelia erinus.Delpino, however, maintains that the power of secreting a sweet fluid byany extra-floral organ has been in every case specially gained, for thesake of attracting ants and wasps as defenders of the plant againsttheir enemies; but I have never seen any reason to believe that this isso with the three species observed by me, namely, Prunus laurocerasus,Vicia sativa, and V. faba. No plant is so little attacked by enemies ofany kind as the common bracken-fern (Pteris aquilina); and yet, as myson Francis has discovered, the large glands at the bases of the fronds,but only whilst young, excrete much sweetish fluid, which is eagerlysought by innumerable ants, chiefly belonging to Myrmica; and these antscertainly do not serve as a protection against any enemy. Delpino arguesthat such glands ought not to be considered as excretory, because ifthey were so, they would be present in every species; but I cannot seemuch force in this argument, as the leaves of some plants excrete sugaronly during certain states of the weather. That in some cases thesecretion serves to attract insects as defenders of the plant, and mayhave been developed to a high degree for this special purpose, I havenot the least doubt, from the observations of Delpino, and moreespecially from those of Mr. Belt on Acacia sphaerocephala, and onpassion-flowers. This acacia likewise produces, as an additionalattraction to ants, small bodies containing much oil and protoplasm, andanalogous bodies are developed by a Cecropia for the same purpose, asdescribed by Fritz Muller. (10/50. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist inNicaragua' 1874 page 218, has given a most interesting account of theparamount importance of ants as defenders of the above Acacia. Withrespect to the Cecropia see 'Nature' 1876 page 304. My son Francis hasdescribed the microscopical structure and development of these wonderfulfood-bodies in a paper read before the Linnean Society.)The excretion of a sweet fluid by glands seated outside of a flower israrely utilised as a means for cross-fertilisation by the aid ofinsects; but this occurs with the bracteae of the Marcgraviaceae, as thelate Dr. Cruger informed me from actual observation in the West Indies,and as Delpino infers with much acuteness from the relative position ofthe several parts of their flowers. (10/51. 'Ult. Osservaz. Dicogamia'1868-69 page 188.) Mr. Farrer has also shown that the flowers ofCoronilla are curiously modified, so that bees may fertilise them whilstsucking the fluid secreted from the outside of the calyx. (10/52.'Nature' 1874 page 169.) It further appears probable from theobservations of the Reverend W.A. Leighton, that the fluid so abundantlysecreted by glands on the phyllodia of the Australian Acacia magnifica,which stand near the flowers, is connected with their fertilisation.(10/53. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 16 1865 page 14.In my work on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids' and in a paper subsequentlypublished in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' it has beenshown that although certain kinds of orchids possess a nectary, nonectar is actually secreted by it; but that insects penetrate the innerwalls and suck the fluid contained in the intercellular spaces. Ifurther suggested, in the case of some other orchids which do notsecrete nectar, that insects gnawed the labellum; and this suggestionhas since been proved true. Hermann Muller and Delpino have now shownthat some other plants have thickened petals which are sucked or gnawedby insects, their fertilisation being thus aided. All the known facts onthis head have been collected by Delpino in his 'Ult. Osserv.' part 2fasc. 2 1875 pages 59-63.)The amount of pollen produced by anemophilous plants, and the distanceto which it is often transported by the wind, are both surprisinglygreat. Mr. Hassall found that the weight of pollen produced by a singleplant of the Bulrush (Typha) was 144 grains. Bucketfuls of pollen,chiefly of Coniferae and Gramineae, have been swept off the decks ofvessels near the North American shore; and Mr. Riley has seen the groundnear St. Louis, in Missouri, covered with pollen, as if sprinkled withsulphur; and there was good reason to believe that this had beentransported from the pine-forests at least 400 miles to the south.Kerner has seen the snow-fields on the higher Alps similarly dusted; andMr. Blackley found numerous pollen-grains, in one instance 1200,adhering to sticky slides, which were sent up to a height of from 500 to1000 feet by means of a kite, and then uncovered by a special mechanism.It is remarkable that in these experiments there were on an averagenineteen times as many pollen-grains in the atmosphere at the higherthan at the lower levels. (10/54. For Mr. Hassall's observations see'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 8 1842 page 108. In the'North American Journal of Science' January 1842, there is an account ofthe pollen swept off the decks of a vessel. Riley 'Fifth Report on theNoxious Insects of Missouri' 1873 page 86. Kerner 'Die Schutzmittel desPollens' 1873 page 6. This author has also seen a lake in the Tyrol socovered with pollen, that the water no longer appeared blue. Mr.Blackley 'Experimental Researches on Hay-fever' 1873 pages 132,141-152.) Considering these facts, it is not so surprising as it atfirst appears that all, or nearly all, the stigmas of anemophilousplants should receive pollen brought to them by mere chance by the wind.During the early part of summer every object is thus dusted with pollen;for instance, I examined for another purpose the labella of a largenumber of flowers of the Fly Ophrys (which is rarely visited byinsects), and found on all very many pollen-grains of other plants,which had been caught by their velvety surfaces.The extraordinary quantity and lightness of the pollen of anemophilousplants are no doubt both necessary, as their pollen has generally to becarried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as weshall soon see, most anemophilous plants have their sexes separated. Thefertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being oflarge size or plumose; and in the case of the Coniferae, by the nakedovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although thenumber of anemophilous species is small, as the author just quotedremarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that ofentomophilous species. This holds good especially in cold and temperateregions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate,and where consequently entomophilous plants are less favourablysituated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, suchas oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae,Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; allthese trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantityof pollen is wasted by anemophilous plants, it is surprising that somany vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals shouldstill exist in any part of the world; for if they had been renderedentomophilous, their pollen would have been transported by the aid ofthe senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safetythan by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly bedoubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediateforms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, aswe may infer from the nature of their nearest allies. (10/55. HermannMuller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 149.)It seems at first sight a still more surprising fact that plants, afterhaving been once rendered entomophilous, should ever again have becomeanemophilous; but this has occasionally though rarely occurred, forinstance, with the common Poterium sanguisorba, as may be inferred fromits belonging to the Rosaceae. Such cases are, however, intelligible, asalmost all plants require to be occasionally intercrossed; and if anyentomiphilous species ceased to be visited by insects, it would probablyperish unless it were rendered anemophilous. A plant would be neglectedby insects if nectar failed to be secreted, unless indeed a large supplyof attractive pollen was present; and from what we have seen of theexcretion of saccharine fluid from leaves and glands being largelygoverned in several cases by climatic influences, and from some fewflowers which do not now secrete nectar still retaining colouredguiding-marks, the failure of the secretion cannot be considered as avery improbable event. The same result would follow to a certainty, ifwinged insects ceased to exist in any district, or became very rare. Nowthere is only a single plant in the great order of the Cruciferae,namely, Pringlea, which is anemophilous, and this plant is an inhabitantof Kerguelen Land, where there are hardly any winged insects, owingprobably, as was suggested by me in the case of Madeira, to the riskwhich they run of being blown out to sea and destroyed. (10/56. TheReverend A.E. Eaton in 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' volume 23 1875page 351.)A remarkable fact with respect to anemophilous plants is that they areoften diclinous, that is, they are either monoecious with their sexesseparated on the same plant, or dioecious with their sexes on distinctplants. In the class Monoecia of Linnaeus, Delpino shows that thespecies of twenty-eight genera are anemophilous, and of seventeen generaentomophilous. (10/57. 'Studi sopra un Lignaggio anemofilo delleCompositae' 1871.) The larger proportion of entomophilous genera in thislatter class is probably the indirect result of insects having the powerof carrying pollen to another and sometimes distant plant much moresecurely than the wind. In the above two classes taken together thereare thirty-eight anemophilous and thirty-six entomophilous genera;whereas in the great mass of hermaphrodite plants the proportion ofanemophilous to entomophilous genera is extremely small. The cause ofthis remarkable difference may be attributed to anemophilous plantshaving retained in a greater degree than the entomophilous a primordialcondition, in which the sexes were separated and their mutualfertilisation effected by means of the wind. That the earliest andlowest members of the vegetable kingdom had their sexes separated, as isstill the case to a large extent, is the opinion of a high authority,Nageli. (10/58. 'Entstehung und Begriff der Naturhist. Art' 1865 page22.) It is indeed difficult to avoid this conclusion, if we admit theview, which seems highly probable, that the conjugation of the Algae andof some of the simplest animals is the first step towards sexualreproduction; and if we further bear in mind that a greater and greaterdegree of differentiation between the cells which conjugate can betraced, thus leading apparently to the development of the two sexualforms. (10/59. See the interesting discussion on this whole subject byO. Butschli in his 'Studien uber die ersten Entwickelungsvorgange derEizelle; etc. 1876 pages 207-219. Also Engelmann "Ueber Entwickelung vonInfusorien" 'Morphol. Jahrbuch' B. 1 page 573. Also Dr. A. Dodel "DieKraushaar-Algae" 'Pringsheims Jahrbuch f. Wiss. Bot.' B. 10.) We havealso seen that as plants became more highly developed and affixed to theground, they would be compelled to be anemophilous in order tointercross. Therefore all plants which have not since been greatlymodified, would tend still to be both diclinous and anemophilous; and wecan thus understand the connection between these two states, althoughthey appear at first sight quite disconnected. If this view is correct,plants must have been rendered hermaphrodites at a later though stillvery early period, and entomophilous at a yet later period, namely,after the development of winged insects. So that the relationshipbetween hermaphroditism and fertilisation by means of insects islikewise to a certain extent intelligible.Why the descendants of plants which were originally dioecious, and whichtherefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual,should have been converted into hermaphrodites, may perhaps be explainedby the risk which they ran, especially as long as they wereanemophilous, of not being always fertilised, and consequently of notleaving offspring. This latter evil, the greatest of all to anyorganism, would have been much lessened by their becominghermaphrodites, though with the contingent disadvantage of frequentself-fertilisation. By what graduated steps an hermaphrodite conditionwas acquired we do not know. But we can see that if a lowly organisedform, in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat differentindividuals, were to increase by budding either before or afterconjugation, the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing bybuds on the same stock, as occasionally occurs with various charactersat the present day. The organism would then be in a monoeciouscondition, and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism;for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock, eachconsisting of a single stamen or pistil, were brought close together andsurrounded by a common envelope, in nearly the same manner as with theflorets of the Compositae, we should have an hermaphrodite flower.There seems to be no limit to the changes which organisms undergo underchanging conditions of life; and some hermaphrodite plants, descended aswe must believe from aboriginally diclinous plants, have had their sexesagain separated. That this has occurred, we may infer from the presenceof rudimentary stamens in the flowers of some individuals, and ofrudimentary pistils in the flowers of other individuals, for example inLychnis dioica. But a conversion of this kind will not have occurredunless cross-fertilisation was already assured, generally by the agencyof insects; but why the production of male and female flowers ondistinct plants should have been advantageous to the species,cross-fertilisation having been previously assured, is far from obvious.A plant might indeed produce twice as many seeds as were necessary tokeep up its numbers under new or changed conditions of life; and if itdid not vary by bearing fewer flowers, and did vary in the state of itsreproductive organs (as often occurs under cultivation), a wastefulexpenditure of seeds and pollen would be saved by the flowers becomingdiclinous.A related point is worth notice. I remarked in my Origin of Species thatin Britain a much larger proportion of trees and bushes than ofherbaceous plants have their sexes separated; and so it is, according toAsa Gray and Hooker, in North America and New Zealand. (10/60. I find inthe 'London Catalogue of British Plants' that there are thirty-twoindigenous trees and bushes in Great Britain, classed under ninefamilies; but to err on the safe side, I have counted only six speciesof willows. Of the thirty-two trees and bushes, nineteen, or more thanhalf, have their sexes separated; and this is an enormous proportioncompared with other British plants. New Zealand abounds with diclinousplants and trees; and Dr. Hooker calculates that out of about 756phanerogamic plants inhabiting the islands, no less than 108 are trees,belonging to thirty-five families. Of these 108 trees, fifty-two, orvery nearly half, have their sexes more or less separated. Of bushesthere are 149, of which sixty-one have their sexes in the same state;whilst of the remaining 500 herbaceous plants only 121, or less than afourth, have their sexes separated. Lastly, Professor Asa Gray informsme that in the United States there are 132 native trees (belonging totwenty-five families) of which ninety-five (belonging to seventeenfamilies) "have their sexes more or less separated, for the greater partdecidedly separated.") It is, however, doubtful how far this rule holdsgood generally, and it certainly does not do so in Australia. But I havebeen assured that the flowers of the prevailing Australian trees,namely, the Myrtaceae, swarm with insects, and if they are dichogamousthey would be practically diclinous. (10/61. With respect to theProteaceae of Australia, Mr. Bentham 'Journal of the Linnean SocietyBotany' volume 13 1871 pages 58, 64, remarks on the various contrivancesby which the stigma in the several genera is screened from the action ofthe pollen from the same flower. For instance, in Synaphea "the stigmais held by the eunuch (i.e., one of the stamens which is barren) safefrom all pollution from her brother anthers, and is preserved intact forany pollen that may be inserted by insects and other agencies.") As faras anemophilous plants are concerned, we know that they are apt to havetheir sexes separated, and we can see that it would be an unfavourablecircumstance for them to bear their flowers very close to the ground, astheir pollen is liable to be blown high up in the air (10/62. Kerner'Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 4.); but as the culms of grassesgive sufficient elevation, we cannot thus account for so many trees andbushes being diclinous. We may infer from our previous discussion that atree bearing numerous hermaphrodite flowers would rarely intercross withanother tree, except by means of the pollen of a distinct individualbeing prepotent over the plants' own pollen. Now the separation of thesexes, whether the plant were anemophilous are entomophilous, would mosteffectually bar self-fertilisation, and this may be the cause of so manytrees and bushes being diclinous. Or to put the case in another way, aplant would be better fitted for development into a tree, if the sexeswere separated, than if it were hermaphrodite; for in the former caseits numerous flowers would be less liable to continuedself-fertilisation. But it should also be observed that the long life ofa tree or bush permits of the separation of the sexes, with much lessrisk of evil from impregnation occasionally failing and seeds not beingproduced, than in the case of short-lived plants. Hence it probably is,as Lecoq has remarked, that annual plants are rarely dioecious.Finally, we have seen reason to believe that the higher plants aredescended from extremely low forms which conjugated, and that theconjugating individuals differed somewhat from one another,--the onerepresenting the male and the other the female--so that plants wereaboriginally dioecious. At a very early period such lowly organiseddioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to monoecious plants withthe two sexes borne by the same individual; and by a still closer unionof the sexes to hermaphrodite plants, which are now much the commonestform. (10/63. There is a considerable amount of evidence that all thehigher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites; and it is acurious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been theresult of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals, whichrepresented the two incipient sexes. On this view, the higher animalsmay now owe their bilateral structure, with all their organs double atan early embryonic period, to the fusion or conjugation of twoprimordial individuals.) As soon as plants became affixed to the ground,their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower,at first almost certainly by the wind, then by pollen-devouring, andafterwards by nectar-seeking insects. During subsequent ages some fewentomophilous plants have been again rendered anemophilous, and somehermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated; and we canvaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certainconditions.Dioecious plants, however fertilised, have a great advantage over otherplants in their cross-fertilisation being assured. But this advantage isgained in the case of anemophilous species at the expense of theproduction of an enormous superfluity of pollen, with some risk to themand to entomophilous species of their fertilisation occasionallyfailing. Half the individuals, moreover, namely, the males, produce noseed, and this might possibly be a disadvantage. Delpino remarks thatdioecious plants cannot spread so easily as monoecious and hermaphroditespecies, for a single individual which happened to reach some new sitecould not propagate its kind; but it may be doubted whether this is aserious evil. Monoecious plants can hardly fail to be to a large extentdioecious in function, owing to the lightness of their pollen and to thewind blowing laterally, with the great additional advantage ofoccasionally or often producing some self-fertilised seeds. When theyare also dichogamous, they are necessarily dioecious in function.Lastly, hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least someself-fertilised seeds, and they are at the same time capable, throughthe various means specified in this chapter, of cross-fertilisation.When their structure absolutely prevents self-fertilisation, they are inthe same relative position to one another as monoecious and dioeciousplants, with what may be an advantage, namely, that every flower iscapable of yielding seeds.CHAPTER XI.THE HABITS OF INSECTS IN RELATION TO THE FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS.Insects visit the flowers of the same species as long as they can.Cause of this habit.Means by which bees recognise the flowers of the same species.Sudden secretion of nectar.Nectar of certain flowers unattractive to certain insects.Industry of bees, and the number of flowers visited within a short time.Perforation of the corolla by bees.Skill shown in the operation.Hive-bees profit by the holes made by humble-bees.Effects of habit.The motive for perforating flowers to save time.Flowers growing in crowded masses chiefly perforated.Bees and various other insects must be directed by instinct to searchflowers for nectar and pollen, as they act in this manner withoutinstruction as soon as they emerge from the pupa state. Their instincts,however, are not of a specialised nature, for they visit many exoticflowers as readily as the endemic kinds, and they often search fornectar in flowers which do not secrete any; and they may be seenattempting to suck it out of nectaries of such length that it cannot bereached by them. (11/1. See, on this subject Hermann Muller'Befruchtung' etc. page 427; and Sir J. Lubbock's 'British Wild Flowers'etc. page 20. Muller 'Bienen Zeitung' June 1876 page 119, assigns goodreasons for his belief that bees and many other Hymenoptera haveinherited from some early nectar-sucking progenitor greater skill inrobbing flowers than that which is displayed by insects belonging to theother Orders.) All kinds of bees and certain other insects usually visitthe flowers of the same species as long as they can, before going toanother species. This fact was observed by Aristotle with respect to thehive-bee more than 2000 years ago, and was noticed by Dobbs in a paperpublished in 1736 in the Philosophical Transactions. It may be observedby any one, both with hive and humble-bees, in every flower-garden; notthat the habit is invariably followed. Mr. Bennett watched for severalhours many plants of Lamium album, L. purpureum, and another Labiateplant, Nepeta glechoma, all growing mingled together on a bank near somehives; and he found that each bee confined its visits to the samespecies. (11/2. 'Nature' 1874 June 4 page 92.) The pollen of these threeplants differs in colour, so that he was able to test his observationsby examining that which adhered to the bodies of the captured bees, andhe found one kind on each bee.Humble and hive-bees are good botanists, for they know that varietiesmay differ widely in the colour of their flowers and yet belong to thesame species. I have repeatedly seen humble-bees flying straight from aplant of the ordinary red Dictamnus fraxinella to a white variety; fromone to another very differently coloured variety of Delphinium consolidaand of Primula veris; from a dark purple to a bright yellow variety ofViola tricolor; and with two species of Papaver, from one variety toanother which differed much in colour; but in this latter case some ofthe bees flew indifferently to either species, although passing by othergenera, and thus acted as if the two species were merely varieties.Hermann Muller also has seen hive-bees flying from flower to flower ofRanunculus bulbosus and arvensis, and of Trifolium fragiferum andrepens; and even from blue hyacinths to blue violets. (11/3. 'BienenZeitung' July 1876 page 183.)Some species of Diptera or flies keep to the flowers of the same specieswith almost as much regularity as do bees; and when captured they arefound covered with pollen. I have seen Rhingia rostrata acting in thismanner with the flowers of Lychnis dioica, Ajuga reptans, and Vicisepium. Volucella plumosa and Empis cheiroptera flew straight fromflower to flower of Myosotis sylvatica. Dolichopus nigripennis behavedin the same manner with Potentilla tormentilla; and other Diptera withStellaria holostea, Helianthemum vulgare, Bellis perennis, Veronicahederaefolia and chamoedrys; but some flies visited indifferently theflowers of these two latter species. I have seen more than once a minuteThrips, with pollen adhering to its body, fly from one flower to anotherof the same kind; and one was observed by me crawling about within aconvolvulus with four grains of pollen adhering to its head, which weredeposited on the stigma.Fabricius and Sprengel state that when flies have once entered theflowers of Aristolochia they never escape,--a statement which I couldnot believe, as in this case the insects would not aid in thecross-fertilisation of the plant; and this statement has now been shownby Hildebrand to be erroneous. As the spathes of Arum maculatum arefurnished with filaments apparently adapted to prevent the exit ofinsects, they resemble in this respect the flowers of Aristolochia; andon examining several spathes, from thirty to sixty minute Dipterabelonging to three species were found in some of them; and many of theseinsects were lying dead at the bottom, as if they had been permanentlyentrapped. In order to discover whether the living ones could escape andcarry pollen to another plant, I tied in the spring of 1842 a finemuslin bag tightly round a spathe; and on returning in an hour's timeseveral little flies were crawling about on the inner surface of thebag. I then gathered a spathe and breathed hard into it; several fliessoon crawled out, and all without exception were dusted with arumpollen. These flies quickly flew away, and I distinctly saw three ofthem fly to another plant about a yard off; they alighted on the inneror concave surface of the spathe, and suddenly flew down into theflower. I then opened this flower, and although not a single anther hadburst, several grains of pollen were lying at the bottom, which musthave been brought from another plant by one of these flies or by someother insect. In another flower little flies were crawling about, and Isaw them leave pollen on the stigmas.I do not know whether Lepidoptera generally keep to the flowers of thesame species; but I once observed many minute moths (I believe Lampronia(Tinea) calthella) apparently eating the pollen of Mercurialis annua,and they had the whole front of their bodies covered with pollen. I thenwent to a female plant some yards off, and saw in the course of fifteenminutes three of these moths alight on the stigmas. Lepidoptera areprobably often induced to frequent the flowers of the same species,whenever these are provided with a long and narrow nectary, as in thiscase other insects cannot suck the nectar, which will thus be preservedfor those having an elongated proboscis. No doubt the Yucca moth visitsonly the flowers whence its name is derived, for a most wonderfulinstinct guides this moth to place pollen on the stigma, so that theovules may be developed on which the larvae feed. (11/4. Described byMr. Riley in the 'American Naturalist' volume 7 October 1873.)Withrespect to Coleoptera, I have seen Meligethes covered with pollen flyingfrom flower to flower of the same species; and this must often occur,as, according to M. Brisout, 'many of the species affect only one kindof plant." (11/5. As quoted in 'American Nat.' May 1873 page 270.)It must not be supposed from these several statements that insectsstrictly confine their visits to the same species. They often visitother species when only a few plants of the same kind grow neartogether. In a flower-garden containing some plants of Oenothera, thepollen of which can easily be recognised, I found not only single grainsbut masses of it within many flowers of Mimulus, Digitalis, Antirrhinum,and Linaria. Other kinds of pollen were likewise detected in these sameflowers. A large number of the stigmas of a plant of Thyme, in which theanthers were completely aborted, were examined; and these stigmas,though scarcely larger than a split needle, were covered not only withpollen of Thyme brought from other plants by the bees, but with severalother kinds of pollen.That insects should visit the flowers of the same species as long asthey can, is of great importance to the plant, as it favours thecross-fertilisation of distinct individuals of the same species; but noone will suppose that insects act in this manner for the good of theplant. The cause probably lies in insects being thus enabled to workquicker; they have just learnt how to stand in the best position on theflower, and how far and in what direction to insert their proboscides.(11/6. Since these remarks were written, I find that Hermann Muller hascome to almost exactly the same conclusion with respect to the cause ofinsects frequenting as long as they can the flowers of the same species:'Bienen Zeitung' July 1876 page 182.) They act on the same principle asdoes an artificer who has to make half-a-dozen engines, and who savestime by making consecutively each wheel and part for all of them.Insects, or at least bees, seem much influenced by habit in all theirmanifold operations; and we shall presently see that this holds good intheir felonious practice of biting holes through the corolla.It is a curious question how bees recognise the flowers of the samespecies. That the coloured corolla is the chief guide cannot be doubted.On a fine day, when hive-bees were incessantly visiting the little blueflowers of Lobelia erinus, I cut off all the petals of some, and onlythe lower striped petals of others, and these flowers were not onceagain sucked by the bees, although some actually crawled over them. Theremoval of the two little upper petals alone made no difference in theirvisits. Mr. J. Anderson likewise states that when he removed thecorollas of the Calceolaria, bees never visited the flowers. (11/7.'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1853 page 534. Kurr cut off the nectaries from alarge number of flowers of several species, and found that the greaternumber yielded seeds; but insects probably would not perceive the lossof the nectary until they had inserted their proboscides into the holesthus formed, and in doing so would fertilise the flowers. He alsoremoved the whole corolla from a considerable number of flowers, andthese likewise yielded seeds. Flowers which are self-fertile wouldnaturally produce seeds under these circumstances; but I am greatlysurprised that Delphinium consolida, as well as another species ofDelphinium, and Viola tricolor, should have produced a fair supply ofseeds when thus treated; but it does not appear that he compared thenumber of the seeds thus produced with those yielded by unmutilatedflowers left to the free access of insects: 'Bedeutung der Nektarien'1833 pages 123-135.) On the other hand, in some large masses of Geraniumphaeum which had escaped out of a garden, I observed the unusual fact ofthe flowers continuing to secrete an abundance of nectar after all thepetals had fallen off; and the flowers in this state were still visitedby humble-bees. But the bees might have learnt that these flowers withall their petals lost were still worth visiting, by finding nectar inthose with only one or two lost. The colour alone of the corolla servesas an approximate guide: thus I watched for some time humble-bees whichwere visiting exclusively plants of the white-flowered Spiranthesautumnalis, growing on short turf at a considerable distance apart; andthese bees often flew within a few inches of several other plants withwhite flowers, and then without further examination passed onwards insearch of the Spiranthes. Again, many hive-bees which confined theirvisits to the common ling (Calluna vulgaris), repeatedly flew towardsErica tetralix, evidently attracted by the nearly similar tint of theirflowers, and then instantly passed on in search of the Calluna.That the colour of the flower is not the sole guide, is clearly shown bythe six cases above given of bees which repeatedly passed in a directline from one variety to another of the same species, although they borevery differently coloured flowers. I observed also bees flying in astraight line from one clump of a yellow-flowered Oenothera to everyother clump of the same plant in the garden, without turning an inchfrom their course to plants of Eschscholtzia and others with yellowflowers which lay only a foot or two on either side. In these cases thebees knew the position of each plant in the garden perfectly well, as wemay infer by the directness of their flight; so that they were guided byexperience and memory. But how did they discover at first that the abovevarieties with differently coloured flowers belonged to the samespecies? Improbable as it may appear, they seem, at least sometimes, torecognise plants even from a distance by their general aspect, in thesame manner as we should do. On three occasions I observed humble-beesflying in a perfectly straight line from a tall larkspur (Delphinium)which was in full flower to another plant of the same species at thedistance of fifteen yards which had not as yet a single flower open, andon which the buds showed only a faint tinge of blue. Here neither odournor the memory of former visits could have come into play, and the tingeof blue was so faint that it could hardly have served as a guide. (11/8.A fact mentioned by Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 347,shows that bees possess acute powers of vision and discrimination; forthose engaged in collecting pollen from Primula elatior invariablypassed by the flowers of the long-styled form, in which the anthers areseated low down in the tubular corolla. Yet the difference in aspectbetween the long-styled and short-styled forms is extremely slight.)The conspicuousness of the corolla does not suffice to induce repeatedvisits from insects, unless nectar is at the same time secreted,together perhaps with some odour emitted. I watched for a fortnight manytimes daily a wall covered with Linaria cymbalaria in full flower, andnever saw a bee even looking at one. There was then a very hot day, andsuddenly many bees were industriously at work on the flowers. It appearsthat a certain degree of heat is necessary for the secretion of nectar;for I observed with Lobelia erinus that if the sun ceased to shine foronly half an hour, the visits of the bees slackened and soon ceased. Ananalogous fact with respect to the sweet excretion from the stipules ofVicia sativa has been already given. As in the case of the Linaria, sowith Pedicularis sylvatica, Polygala vulgaris, Viola tricolor, and somespecies of Trifolium, I have watched the flowers day after day withoutseeing a bee at work, and then suddenly all the flowers were visited bymany bees. Now how did so many bees discover at once that the flowerswere secreting nectar? I presume that it must have been by their odour;and that as soon as a few bees began to suck the flowers, others of thesame and of different kinds observed the fact and profited by it. Weshall presently see, when we treat of the perforation of the corolla,that bees are fully capable of profiting by the labour of other species.Memory also comes into play, for, as already remarked, bees know theposition of each clump of flowers in a garden. I have repeatedly seenthem passing round a corner, but otherwise in as straight a line aspossible, from one plant of Fraxinella and of Linaria to another anddistant one of the same species; although, owing to the intervention ofother plants, the two were not in sight of each other.It would appear that either the taste or the odour of the nectar ofcertain flowers is unattractive to hive or to humble-bees, or to both;for there seems no other reason why certain open flowers which secretenectar are not visited by them. The small quantity of nectar secreted bysome of these flowers can hardly be the cause of their neglect, ashive-bees search eagerly for the minute drops on the glands on theleaves of the Prunus laurocerasus. Even the bees from different hivessometimes visit different kinds of flowers, as is said to be the case byMr. Grant with respect to the Polyanthus and Viola tricolor. (11/9.'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1844 page 374.) I have known humble-bees to visitthe flowers of Lobelia fulgens in one garden and not in another at thedistance of only a few miles. The cupful of nectar in the labellum ofEpipactis latifolia is never touched by hive- or humble-bees, although Ihave seen them flying close by; and yet the nectar has a pleasant tasteto us, and is habitually consumed by the common wasp. As far as I haveseen, wasps seek for nectar in this country only from the flowers ofthis Epipactis, Scrophularia aquatica, Symphoricarpus racemosa (11/10.The same fact apparently holds good in Italy, for Delpino says that theflowers of these three plants are alone visited by wasps: 'NettariiEstranuziali, Bulletino Entomologico' anno 6.), and Tritoma; the twoformer plants being endemic, and the two latter exotic. As wasps are sofond of sugar and of any sweet fluid, and as they do not disdain theminute drops on the glands of Prunus laurocerasus, it is a strange factthat they do not suck the nectar of many open flowers, which they coulddo without the aid of a proboscis. Hive-bees visit the flowers of theSymphoricarpus and Tritoma, and this makes it all the stranger that theydo not visit the flowers of the Epipactis, or, as far as I have seen,those of the Scrophularia aquatica; although they do visit the flowersof Scrophularia nodosa, at least in North America. (11/11. 'Silliman'sAmerican Journal of Science' August 1871.)The extraordinary industry of bees and the number of flowers which theyvisit within a short time, so that each flower is visited repeatedly,must greatly increase the chance of each receiving pollen from adistinct plant. When the nectar is in any way hidden, bees cannot tellwithout inserting their proboscides whether it has lately been exhaustedby other bees, and this, as remarked in a former chapter, forces them tovisit many more flowers than they otherwise would. But they endeavour tolose as little time as they can; thus in flowers having severalnectaries, if they find one dry they do not try the others, but as Ihave often observed, pass on to another flower. They work soindustriously and effectually, that even in the case of social plants,of which hundreds of thousands grow together, as with the several kindsof heath, every single flower is visited, of which evidence willpresently be given. They lose no time and fly very quickly from plant toplant, but I do not know the rate at which hive-bees fly. Humble-beesfly at the rate of ten miles an hour, as I was able to ascertain in thecase of the males from their curious habit of calling at certain fixedpoints, which made it easy to measure the time taken in passing from oneplace to another.With respect to the number of flowers which bees visit in a given time,I observed that in exactly one minute a humble-bee visited twenty-fourof the closed flowers of the Linaria cymbalaria; another bee visited inthe same time twenty-two flowers of the Symphoricarpus racemosa; andanother seventeen flowers on two plants of a Delphinium. In the courseof fifteen minutes a single flower on the summit of a plant of Oenotherawas visited eight times by several humble-bees, and I followed the lastof these bees, whilst it visited in the course of a few additionalminutes every plant of the same species in a large flower-garden. Innineteen minutes every flower on a small plant of Nemophila insignis wasvisited twice. In one minute six flowers of a Campanula were entered bya pollen-collecting hive-bee; and bees when thus employed work slowerthan when sucking nectar. Lastly, seven flower-stalks on a plant ofDictamnus fraxinella were observed on the 15th of June 1841 during tenminutes; they were visited by thirteen humble-bees each of which enteredmany flowers. On the 22nd the same flower-stalks were visited within thesame time by eleven humble-bees. This plant bore altogether 280 flowers,and from the above data, taking into consideration how late in theevening humble-bees work, each flower must have been visited at leastthirty times daily, and the same flower keeps open during several days.The frequency of the visits of bees is also sometimes shown by themanner in which the petals are scratched by their hooked tarsi; I haveseen large beds of Mimulus, Stachys, and Lathyrus with the beauty oftheir flowers thus sadly defaced.PERFORATION OF THE COROLLA BY BEES.I have already alluded to bees biting holes in flowers for the sake ofobtaining the nectar. They often act in this manner, both with endemicand exotic species, in many parts of Europe, in the United States, andin the Himalaya; and therefore probably in all parts of the world. Theplants, the fertilisation of which actually depends on insects enteringthe flowers, will fail to produce seed when their nectar is stolen fromthe outside; and even with those species which are capable offertilising themselves without any aid, there can be nocross-fertilisation, and this, as we know, is a serious evil in mostcases. The extent to which humble-bees carry on the practice of bitingholes is surprising: a remarkable case was observed by me nearBournemouth, where there were formerly extensive heaths. I took a longwalk, and every now and then gathered a twig of Erica tetralix, and whenI had got a handful all the flowers were examined through a lens. Thisprocess was repeated many times; but though many hundreds were examined,I did not succeed in finding a single flower which had not beenperforated. Humble-bees were at the time sucking the flowers throughthese perforations. On the following day a large number of flowers wereexamined on another heath with the same result, but here hive-bees weresucking through the holes. This case is all the more remarkable, as theinnumerable holes had been made within a fortnight, for before that timeI saw the bees everywhere sucking in the proper manner at the mouths ofthe corolla. In an extensive flower-garden some large beds of Salviagrahami, Stachys coccinea, and Pentstemon argutus (?) had every flowerperforated, and many scores were examined. I have seen whole fields ofred clover (Trifolium pratense) in the same state. Dr. Ogle found that90 per cent of the flowers of Salvia glutinosa had been bitten. In theUnited States Mr. Bailey says it is difficult to find a blossom of thenative Gerardia pedicularia without a hole in it; and Mr. Gentry, inspeaking of the introduced Wistaria sinensis, says "that nearly everyflower had been perforated." (11/12. Dr. Ogle 'Pop. Science Review' July1869 page 267. Bailey 'American Naturalist' November 1873 page 690.Gentry ibid May 1875 page 264.)As far as I have seen, it is always humble-bees which first bite theholes, and they are well fitted for the work by possessing powerfulmandibles; but hive-bees afterwards profit by the holes thus made. Dr.Hermann Muller, however, writes to me that hive-bees sometimes biteholes through the flowers of Erica tetralix. No insects except bees,with the single exception of wasps in the case of Tritoma, have senseenough, as far as I have observed, to profit by the holes already made.Even humble-bees do not always discover that it would be advantageous tothem to perforate certain flowers. There is an abundant supply of nectarin the nectary of Tropaeolum tricolor, yet I have found this plantuntouched in more than one garden, while the flowers of other plants hadbeen extensively perforated; but a few years ago Sir J. Lubbock'sgardener assured me that he had seen humble-bees boring through thenectary of this Tropaeolum. Muller has observed humble-bees trying tosuck at the mouths of the flowers of Primula elatior and of anAquilegia, and, failing in their attempts, they made holes through thecorolla; but they often bite holes, although they could with very littlemore trouble obtain the nectar in a legitimate manner by the mouth ofthe corolla.Dr. W. Ogle has communicated to me a curious case. He gathered inSwitzerland 100 flower-stems of the common blue variety of the monkshood(Aconitum napellus), and not a single flower was perforated; he thengathered 100 stems of a white variety growing close by, and every one ofthe open flowers had been perforated. (11/13. Dr. Ogle 'Popular ScienceReview' July 1869 page 267. Bailey 'American Naturalist' November 1873page 690. Gentry ibid May 1875 page 264.) This surprising difference inthe state of the flowers may be attributed with much probability to theblue variety being distasteful to bees, from the presence of the acridmatter which is so general in the Ranunculaceae, and to its absence inthe white variety in correlation with the loss of the blue tint.According to Sprengel, this plant is strongly proterandrous (11/14. 'DasEntdeckte' etc. page 278.); it would therefore be more or less sterileunless bees carried pollen from the younger to the older flowers.Consequently the white variety, the flowers of which were always bitteninstead of being properly entered by the bees, would fail to yield thefull number of seeds and would be a comparatively rare plant, as Dr.Ogle informs me was the case.Bees show much skill in their manner of working, for they always maketheir holes from the outside close to the spot where the nectar lieshidden within the corolla. All the flowers in a large bed of Stachyscoccinea had either one or two slits made on the upper side of thecorolla near the base. The flowers of a Mirabilis and of Salvia coccineawere perforated in the same manner; whilst those of Salvia grahami, inwhich the calyx is much elongated, had both the calyx and the corollainvariably perforated. The flowers of Pentstemon argutus are broaderthan those of the plants just named, and two holes alongside each otherhad here always been made just above the calyx. In these several casesthe perforations were on the upper side, but in Antirrhinum majus one ortwo holes had been made on the lower side, close to the littleprotuberance which represents the nectary, and therefore directly infront of and close to the spot where the nectar is secreted.But the most remarkable case of skill and judgment known to me, is thatof the perforation of the flowers of Lathyrus sylvestris, as describedby my son Francis. (11/15. 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189.) Thenectar in this plant is enclosed within a tube, formed by the unitedstamens, which surround the pistil so closely that a bee is forced toinsert its proboscis outside the tube; but two natural rounded passagesor orifices are left in the tube near the base, in order that the nectarmay be reached by the bees. Now my son found in sixteen out oftwenty-four flowers on this plant, and in eleven out of sixteen of thoseon the cultivated everlasting pea, which is either a variety of the samespecies or a closely allied one, that the left passage was larger thanthe right one. And here comes the remarkable point,--the humble-beesbite holes through the standard-petal, and they always operated on theleft side over the passage, which is generally the larger of the two. Myson remarks: "It is difficult to say how the bees could have acquiredthis habit. Whether they discovered the inequality in the size of thenectar-holes in sucking the flowers in the proper way, and then utilisedthis knowledge in determining where to gnaw the hole; or whether theyfound out the best situation by biting through the standard at variouspoints, and afterwards remembered its situation in visiting otherflowers. But in either case they show a remarkable power of making useof what they have learnt by experience." It seems probable that bees owetheir skill in biting holes through flowers of all kinds to their havinglong practised the instinct of moulding cells and pots of wax, or ofenlarging their old cocoons with tubes of wax; for they are thuscompelled to work on the inside and outside of the same object.In the early part of the summer of 1857 I was led to observe during someweeks several rows of the scarlet kidney-bean (Phaseolus multiflorus),whilst attending to the fertilisation of this plant, and daily sawhumble- and hive-bees sucking at the mouths of the flowers. But one dayI found several humble-bees employed in cutting holes in flower afterflower; and on the next day every single hive-bee, without exception,instead of alighting on the left wing-petal and sucking the flower inthe proper manner, flew straight without the least hesitation to thecalyx, and sucked through the holes which had been made only the daybefore by the humble-bees; and they continued this habit for manyfollowing days. (11/16. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725.) Mr. Belthas communicated to me (July 28th, 1874) a similar case, with the soledifference that less than half of the flowers had been perforated by thehumble-bees; nevertheless, all the hive-bees gave up sucking at themouths of the flowers and visited exclusively the bitten ones. Now howdid the hive-bees find out so quickly that holes had been made? Instinctseems to be out of the question, as the plant is an exotic. The holescannot be seen by bees whilst standing on the wing-petals, where theyhad always previously alighted. From the ease with which bees weredeceived when the petals of Lobelia erinus were cut off, it was clearthat in this case they were not guided to the nectar by its smell; andit may be doubted whether they were attracted to the holes in theflowers of the Phaseolus by the odour emitted from them. Did theyperceive the holes by the sense of touch in their proboscides, whilstsucking the flowers in the proper manner, and then reason that it wouldsave them time to alight on the outside of the flowers and use theholes? This seems almost too abstruse an act of reason for bees; and itis more probable that they saw the humble-bees at work, andunderstanding what they were about, imitated them and took advantage ofthe shorter path to the nectar. Even with animals high in the scale,such as monkeys, we should be surprised at hearing that all theindividuals of one species within the space of twenty-four hoursunderstood an act performed by a distinct species, and profited by it.I have repeatedly observed with various kinds of flowers that all thehive and humble-bees which were sucking through the perforations, flewto them, whether on the upper or under side of the corolla, without theleast hesitation; and this shows how quickly all the individuals withinthe district had acquired the same knowledge. Yet habit comes into playto a certain extent, as in so many of the other operations of bees. Dr.Ogle, Messrs. Farrer and Belt have observed in the case of Phaseolusmultiflorus that certain individuals went exclusively to theperforations, while others of the same species visited only the mouthsof the flowers. (11/17. Dr. Ogle 'Pop. Science Review' April 1870 page167. Mr. Farrer 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 4th seriesvolume 2 1868 page 258. Mr. Belt in a letter to me.) I noticed in 1861exactly the same fact with Trifolium pratense. So persistent is theforce of habit, that when a bee which is visiting perforated flowerscomes to one which has not been bitten, it does not go to the mouth, butinstantly flies away in search of another bitten flower. Nevertheless, Ionce saw a humble-bee visiting the hybrid Rhododendron azaloides, and itentered the mouths of some flowers and cut holes into the others. Dr.Hermann Muller informs me that in the same district he has seen someindividuals of Bombus mastrucatus boring through the calyx and corollaof Rhinanthus alecterolophus, and others through the corolla alone.Different species of bees may, however, sometimes be observed actingdifferently at the same time on the same plant. I have seen hive-beessucking at the mouths of the flowers of the common bean; humble-bees ofone kind sucking through holes bitten in the calyx, and humble-bees ofanother kind sucking the little drops of fluid excreted by the stipules.Mr. Beal of Michigan informs me that the flowers of the Missouri currant(Ribes aureum) abound with nectar, so that children often suck them; andhe saw hive-bees sucking through holes made by a bird, the oriole, andat the same time humble-bees sucking in the proper manner at the mouthsof the flowers. (11/18. The flowers of the Ribes are however sometimesperforated by humble-bees, and Mr. Bundy says that they were able tobite through and rob seven flowers of their honey in a minute: 'AmericanNaturalist' 1876 page 238.) This statement about the oriole calls tomind what I have before said of certain species of humming-birds boringholes through the flowers of the Brugmansia, whilst other speciesentered by the mouth.The motive which impels bees to gnaw holes through the corolla seems tobe the saving of time, for they lose much time in climbing into and outof large flowers, and in forcing their heads into closed ones. They wereable to visit nearly twice as many flowers, as far as I could judge, ofa Stachys and Pentstemon by alighting on the upper surface of thecorolla and sucking through the cut holes, than by entering in theproper way. Nevertheless each bee before it has had much practice, mustlose some time in making each new perforation, especially when theperforation has to be made through both calyx and corolla. This actiontherefore implies foresight, of which faculty we have abundant evidencein their building operations; and may we not further believe that sometrace of their social instinct, that is, of working for the good ofother members of the community, may here likewise play a part?Many years ago I was struck with the fact that humble-bees as a generalrule perforate flowers only when these grow in large numbers neartogether. In a garden where there were some very large beds of Stachyscoccinea and of Pentstemon argutus, every single flower was perforated,but I found two plants of the former species growing quite separate withtheir petals much scratched, showing that they had been frequentlyvisited by bees, and yet not a single flower was perforated. I foundalso a separate plant of the Pentstemon, and saw bees entering the mouthof the corolla, and not a single flower had been perforated. In thefollowing year (1842) I visited the same garden several times: on the19th of July humble-bees were sucking the flowers of Stachys coccineaand Salvia grahami in the proper manner, and none of the corollas wereperforated. On the 7th of August all the flowers were perforated, eventhose on some few plants of the Salvia which grew at a little distancefrom the great bed. On the 21st of August only a few flowers on thesummits of the spikes of both species remained fresh, and not one ofthese was now bored. Again, in my own garden every plant in several rowsof the common bean had many flowers perforated; but I found three plantsin separate parts of the garden which had sprung up accidentally, andthese had not a single flower perforated. General Strachey formerly sawmany perforated flowers in a garden in the Himalaya, and he wrote to theowner to inquire whether this relation between the plants growingcrowded and their perforation by the bees there held good, and wasanswered in the affirmative. Hence it follows that the red clover(Trifolium pratense) and the common bean when cultivated in great massesin fields,--that Erica tetralix growing in large numbers onheaths,--rows of the scarlet kidney-bean in the kitchen-garden,--andmasses of any species in the flower-garden,--are all eminently liable tobe perforated.The explanation of this fact is not difficult. Flowers growing in largenumbers afford a rich booty to the bees, and are conspicuous from adistance. They are consequently visited by crowds of these insects, andI once counted between twenty and thirty bees flying about a bed ofPentstemon. They are thus stimulated to work quickly by rivalry, and,what is much more important, they find a large proportion of theflowers, as suggested by my son, with their nectaries sucked dry.(11/19. 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189.) They thus waste much time insearching many empty flowers, and are led to bite the holes, so as tofind out as quickly as possible whether there is any nectar present, andif so, to obtain it.Flowers which are partially or wholly sterile unless visited by insectsin the proper manner, such as those of most species of Salvia, ofTrifolium pratense, Phaseolus multiflorus, etc., will fail more or lesscompletely to produce seeds if the bees confine their visits to theperforations. The perforated flowers of those species, which are capableof fertilising themselves, will yield only self-fertilised seeds, andthe seedlings will in consequence be less vigorous. Therefore all plantsmust suffer in some degree when bees obtain their nectar in a feloniousmanner by biting holes through the corolla; and many species, it mightbe thought, would thus be exterminated. But here, as is so generalthroughout nature, there is a tendency towards a restored equilibrium.If a plant suffers from being perforated, fewer individuals will bereared, and if its nectar is highly important to the bees, these intheir turn will suffer and decrease in number; but, what is much moreeffective, as soon as the plant becomes somewhat rare so as not to growin crowded masses, the bees will no longer be stimulated to gnaw holesin the flowers, but will enter them in a legitimate manner. More seedwill then be produced, and the seedlings being the product ofcross-fertilisation will be vigorous, so that the species will tend toincrease in number, to be again checked, as soon as the plant againgrows in crowded masses.CHAPTER XII.GENERAL RESULTS.Cross-fertilisation proved to be beneficial, and self-fertilisationinjurious.Allied species differ greatly in the means by which cross-fertilisationis favoured and self-fertilisation avoided.The benefits and evils of the two processes depend on the degree ofdifferentiation in the sexual elements.The evil effects not due to the combination of morbid tendencies in theparents.Nature of the conditions to which plants are subjected when growing neartogether in a state of nature or under culture, and the effects of suchconditions.Theoretical considerations with respect to the interaction ofdifferentiated sexual elements.Practical lessons.Genesis of the two sexes.Close correspondence between the effects of cross-fertilisation andself-fertilisation, and of the legitimate and illegitimate unions ofheterostyled plants, in comparison with hybrid unions.The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn fromthe observations given in this volume, is that cross-fertilisation isgenerally beneficial, and self-fertilisation injurious. This is shown bythe difference in height, weight, constitutional vigour, and fertilityof the offspring from crossed and self-fertilised flowers, and in thenumber of seeds produced by the parent-plants. With respect to thesecond of these two propositions, namely, that self-fertilisation isgenerally injurious, we have abundant evidence. The structure of theflowers in such plants as Lobelia ramosa, Digitalis purpurea, etc.,renders the aid of insects almost indispensable for their fertilisation;and bearing in mind the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individualover that from the same individual, such plants will almost certainlyhave been crossed during many or all previous generations. So it mustbe, owing merely to the prepotency of foreign pollen, with cabbages andvarious other plants, the varieties of which almost invariablyintercross when grown together. The same inference may be drawn stillmore surely with respect to those plants, such as Reseda andEschscholtzia, which are sterile with their own pollen, but fertile withthat from any other individual. These several plants must therefore havebeen crossed during a long series of previous generations, and theartificial crosses in my experiments cannot have increased the vigour ofthe offspring beyond that of their progenitors. Therefore the differencebetween the self-fertilised and crossed plants raised by me cannot beattributed to the superiority of the crossed, but to the inferiority ofthe self-fertilised seedlings, due to the injurious effects ofself-fertilisation.With respect to the first proposition, namely, that cross-fertilisationis generally beneficial, we likewise have excellent evidence. Plants ofIpomoea were intercrossed for nine successive generations; they werethen again intercrossed, and at the same time crossed with a plant of afresh stock, that is, one brought from another garden; and the offspringof this latter cross were to the intercrossed plants in height as 100 to78, and in fertility as 100 to 51. An analogous experiment withEschscholtzia gave a similar result, as far as fertility was concerned.In neither of these cases were any of the plants the product ofself-fertilisation. Plants of Dianthus were self-fertilised for threegenerations, and this no doubt was injurious; but when these plants werefertilised by a fresh stock and by intercrossed plants of the samestock, there was a great difference in fertility between the two sets ofseedlings, and some difference in their height. Petunia offers a nearlyparallel case. With various other plants, the wonderful effects of across with a fresh stock may be seen in Table 7/C. Several accounts havealso been published of the extraordinary growth of seedlings from across between two varieties of the same species, some of which are knownnever to fertilise themselves; so that here neither self-fertilisationnor relationship even in a remote degree can have come into play. (12/1.See 'Variation under Domestication' chapter 19 2nd edition volume 2 page159.) We may therefore conclude that the above two propositions aretrue,--that cross-fertilisation is generally beneficial andself-fertilisation injurious to the offspring.That certain plants, for instance, Viola tricolor, Digitalis purpurea,Sarothamnus scoparius, Cyclamen persicum, etc., which have beennaturally cross-fertilised for many or all previous generations, shouldsuffer to an extreme degree from a single act of self-fertilisation is amost surprising fact. Nothing of the kkind has been observed in ourdomestic animals; but then we must remember that the closest possibleinterbreeding with such animals, that is, between brothers and sisters,cannot be considered as nearly so close a union as that between thepollen and ovules of the same flower. Whether the evil fromself-fertilisation goes on increasing during successive generations isnot as yet known; but we may infer from my experiments that the increaseif any is far from rapid. After plants have been propagated byself-fertilisation for several generations, a single cross with a freshstock restores their pristine vigour; and we have a strictly analogousresult with our domestic animals. (12/2. Ibid chapter 19 2nd editionvolume 2 page 159.) The good effects of cross-fertilisation aretransmitted by plants to the next generation; and judging from thevarieties of the common pea, to many succeeding generations. But thismay merely be that crossed plants of the first generation are extremelyvigorous, and transmit their vigour, like any other character, to theirsuccessors.Notwithstanding the evil which many plants suffer fromself-fertilisation, they can be thus propagated under favourableconditions for many generations, as shown by some of my experiments, andmore especially by the survival during at least half a century of thesame varieties of the common pea and sweet-pea. The same conclusionprobably holds good with several other exotic plants, which are never ormost rarely cross-fertilised in this country. But all these plants, asfar as they have been tried, profit greatly by a cross with a freshstock. Some few plants, for instance, Ophrys apifera, have almostcertainly been propagated in a state of nature for thousands ofgenerations without having been once intercrossed; and whether theywould profit by a cross with a fresh stock is not known. But such casesought not to make us doubt that as a general rule crossing isbeneficial, any more than the existence of plants which, in a state ofnature, are propagated exclusively by rhizomes, stolons, etc. (theirflowers never producing seeds), (12/3. I have given several cases in my'Variation under Domestication' chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 page152.) (their flowers never producing seeds), should make us doubt thatseminal generation must have some great advantage, as it is the commonplan followed by nature. Whether any species has been reproducedasexually from a very remote period cannot, of course, be ascertained.Our sole means for forming any judgment on this head is the duration ofthe varieties of our fruit trees which have been long propagated bygrafts or buds. Andrew Knight formerly maintained that under thesecircumstances they always become weakly, but this conclusion has beenwarmly disputed by others. A recent and competent judge, Professor AsaGray, leans to the side of Andrew Knight, which seems to me, from suchevidence as I have been able to collect, the more probable view,notwithstanding many opposed facts. (12/4. 'Darwiniana: Essays andReviews pertaining to Darwinism' 1876 page 338.)The means for favouring cross-fertilisation and preventingself-fertilisation, or conversely for favouring self-fertilisation andpreventing to a certain extent cross-fertilisation, are wonderfullydiversified; and it is remarkable that these differ widely in closelyallied plants,--in the species of the same genus, and sometimes in theindividuals of the same species. (12/5. Hildebrand has insisted stronglyto this effect in his valuable observations on the fertilisation of theGramineae: 'Monatsbericht K. Akad. Berlin' October 1872 page 763.) It isnot rare to find hermaphrodite plants and others with separated sexeswithin the same genus; and it is common to find some of the speciesdichogamous and others maturing their sexual elements simultaneously.The dichogamous genus Saxifraga contains proterandrous and proterogynousspecies. (12/6. Dr. Engler 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 page 833.) Severalgenera include both heterostyled (dimorphic or trimorphic forms) andhomostyled species. Ophrys offers a remarkable instance of one specieshaving its structure manifestly adapted for self-fertilisation, andother species as manifestly adapted for cross-fertilisation. Somecon-generic species are quite sterile and others quite fertile withtheir own pollen. From these several causes we often find within thesame genus species which do not produce seeds, while others produce anabundance, when insects are excluded. Some species bear cleistogeneflowers which cannot be crossed, as well as perfect flowers, whilstothers in the same genus never produce cleistogene flowers. Some speciesexist under two forms, the one bearing conspicuous flowers adapted forcross-fertilisation, the other bearing inconspicuous flowers adapted forself-fertilisation, whilst other species in the same genus present onlya single form. Even with the individuals of the same species, the degreeof self-sterility varies greatly, as in Reseda. With polygamous plants,the distribution of the sexes differs in the individuals of the samespecies. The relative period at which the sexual elements in the sameflower are mature, differs in the varieties of Pelargonium; and Carrieregives several cases, showing that the period varies according to thetemperature to which the plants are exposed. (12/7. 'Des Varieties' 1865page 30.)This extraordinary diversity in the means for favouring or preventingcross- and self-fertilisation in closely allied forms, probably dependson the results of both processes being highly beneficial to the species,but directly opposed in many ways to one another and dependent onvariable conditions. Self-fertilisation assures the production of alarge supply of seeds; and the necessity or advantage of this will bedetermined by the average length of life of the plant, which largelydepends on the amount of destruction suffered by the seeds andseedlings. This destruction follows from the most various and variablecauses, such as the presence of animals of several kinds, and the growthof surrounding plants. The possibility of cross-fertilisation dependsmainly on the presence and number of certain insects, often of insectsbelonging to special groups, and on the degree to which they areattracted to the flowers of any particular species in preference toother flowers,--all circumstances likely to change. Moreover, theadvantages which follow from cross-fertilisation differ much indifferent plants, so that it is probable that allied plants would oftenprofit in different degrees by cross-fertilisation. Under theseextremely complex and fluctuating conditions, with two somewhat opposedends to be gained, namely, the safe propagation of the species and theproduction of cross-fertilised, vigorous offspring, it is not surprisingthat allied forms should exhibit an extreme diversity in the means whichfavour either end. If, as there is reason to suspect, self-fertilisationis in some respects beneficial, although more than counterbalanced bythe advantages derived from a cross with a fresh stock, the problembecomes still more complicated.As I only twice experimented on more than a single species in a genus, Icannot say whether the crossed offspring of the several species withinthe same genus differ in their degree of superiority over theirself-fertilised brethren; but I should expect that this would oftenprove to be the case from what was observed with the two species ofLobelia and with the individuals of the same species of Nicotiana. Thespecies belonging to distinct genera in the same family certainly differin this respect. The effects of cross- and self-fertilisation may beconfined either to the growth or to the fertility of the offspring, butgenerally extends to both qualities. There does not seem to exist anyclose correspondence between the degree to which their offspring profitby this process; but we may easily err on this head, as there are twomeans for ensuring cross-fertilisation which are not externallyperceptible, namely, self-sterility and the prepotent fertilisinginfluence of pollen from another individual. Lastly, it has been shownin a former chapter that the effect produced by cross andself-fertilisation on the fertility of the parent-plants does not alwayscorrespond with that produced on the height, vigour, and fertility oftheir offspring. The same remark applies to crossed and self-fertilisedseedlings when these are used as the parent-plants. This want ofcorrespondence probably depends, at least in part, on the number ofseeds produced being chiefly determined by the number of thepollen-tubes which reach the ovules, and this will be governed by thereaction between the pollen and the stigmatic secretion or tissues;whereas the growth and constitutional vigour of the offspring will bechiefly determined, not only by the number of pollen-tubes reaching theovules, but by the nature of the reaction between the contents of thepollen-grains and ovules.There are two other important conclusions which may be deduced from myobservations: firstly, that the advantages of cross-fertilisation do notfollow from some mysterious virtue in the mere union of two distinctindividuals, but from such individuals having been subjected duringprevious generations to different conditions, or to their having variedin a manner commonly called spontaneous, so that in either case theirsexual elements have been in some degree differentiated. And secondly,that the injury from self-fertilisation follows from the want of suchdifferentiation in the sexual elements. These two propositions are fullyestablished by my experiments. Thus, when plants of the Ipomoea and ofthe Mimulus, which had been self-fertilised for the seven previousgenerations and had been kept all the time under the same conditions,were intercrossed one with another, the offspring did not profit in theleast by the cross. Mimulus offers another instructive case, showingthat the benefit of a cross depends on the previous treatment of theprogenitors: plants which had been self-fertilised for the eightprevious generations were crossed with plants which had beenintercrossed for the same number of generations, all having been keptunder the same conditions as far as possible; seedlings from this crosswere grown in competition with others derived from the sameself-fertilised mother-plant crossed by a fresh stock; and the latterseedlings were to the former in height as 100 to 52, and in fertility as100 to 4. An exactly parallel experiment was tried on Dianthus, withthis difference, that the plants had been self-fertilised only for thethree previous generations, and the result was similar though not sostrongly marked. The foregoing two cases of the offspring of Ipomoea andEschscholtzia, derived from a cross with a fresh stock, being as muchsuperior to the intercrossed plants of the old stock, as these latterwere to the self-fertilised offspring, strongly supports the sameconclusion. A cross with a fresh stock or with another variety seems tobe always highly beneficial, whether or not the mother-plants have beenintercrossed or self-fertilised for several previous generations. Thefact that a cross between two flowers on the same plant does no good orvery little good, is likewise a strong corroboration of our conclusion;for the sexual elements in the flowers on the same plant can rarely havebeen differentiated, though this is possible, as flower-buds are in onesense distinct individuals, sometimes varying and differing from oneanother in structure or constitution. Thus the proposition that thebenefit from cross-fertilisation depends on the plants which are crossedhaving been subjected during previous generations to somewhat differentconditions, or to their having varied from some unknown cause as if theyhad been thus subjected, is securely fortified on all sides.Before proceeding any further, the view which has been maintained byseveral physiologists must be noticed, namely, that all the evils frombreeding animals too closely, and no doubt, as they would say, from theself-fertilisation of plants, is the result of the increase of somemorbid tendency or weakness of constitution common to the closelyrelated parents, or to the two sexes of hermaphrodite plants.Undoubtedly injury has often thus resulted; but it is a vain attempt toextend this view to the numerous cases given in my Tables. It should beremembered that the same mother-plant was both self-fertilised andcrossed, so that if she had been unhealthy she would have transmittedhalf her morbid tendencies to her crossed offspring. But plantsappearing perfectly healthy, some of them growing wild, or the immediateoffspring of wild plants, or vigorous common garden-plants, wereselected for experiment. Considering the number of species which weretried, it is nothing less than absurd to suppose that in all these casesthe mother-plants, though not appearing in any way diseased, were weakor unhealthy in so peculiar a manner that their self-fertilisedseedlings, many hundreds in number, were rendered inferior in height,weight, constitutional vigour and fertility to their crossed offspring.Moreover, this belief cannot be extended to the strongly markedadvantages which invariably follow, as far as my experience serves, fromintercrossing the individuals of the same variety or of distinctvarieties, if these have been subjected during some generations todifferent conditions.It is obvious that the exposure of two sets of plants during severalgenerations to different conditions can lead to no beneficial results,as far as crossing is concerned, unless their sexual elements are thusaffected. That every organism is acted on to a certain extent by achange in its environment, will not, I presume, be disputed. It ishardly necessary to advance evidence on this head; we can perceive thedifference between individual plants of the same species which havegrown in somewhat more shady or sunny, dry or damp places. Plants whichhave been propagated for some generations under different climates or atdifferent seasons of the year transmit different constitutions to theirseedlings. Under such circumstances, the chemical constitution of theirfluids and the nature of their tissues are often modified. (12/8.Numerous cases together with references are given in my 'Variation underDomestication' chapter 23 2nd edition volume 2 page 264. With respect toanimals, Mr. Brackenridge 'A Contribution to the Theory of Diathesis'Edinburgh 1869, has well shown that the different organs of animals areexcited into different degrees of activity by differences of temperatureand food, and become to a certain extent adapted to them.) Many othersuch facts could be adduced. In short, every alteration in the functionof a part is probably connected with some corresponding, though oftenquite imperceptible change in structure or composition.Whatever affects an organism in any way, likewise tends to act on itssexual elements. We see this in the inheritance of newly acquiredmodifications, such as those from the increased use or disuse of a part,and even from mutilations if followed by disease. (12/9. 'Variationunder Domestication' chapter 12 2nd edition volume 1 page 466.) We haveabundant evidence how susceptible the reproductive system is to changedconditions, in the many instances of animals rendered sterile byconfinement; so that they will not unite, or if they unite do notproduce offspring, though the confinement may be far from close; and ofplants rendered sterile by cultivation. But hardly any cases afford morestriking evidence how powerfully a change in the conditions of life actson the sexual elements, than those already given, of plants which arecompletely self-sterile in one country, and when brought to another,yield, even in the first generation, a fair supply of self-fertilisedseeds.But it may be said, granting that changed conditions act on the sexualelements, how can two or more plants growing close together, either intheir native country or in a garden, be differently acted on, inasmuchas they appear to be exposed to exactly the same conditions? Althoughthis question has been already considered, it deserves furtherconsideration under several points of view. In my experiments withDigitalis purpurea, some flowers on a wild plant were self-fertilised,and others were crossed with pollen from another plant growing withintwo or three feet's distance. The crossed and self-fertilised plantsraised from the seeds thus obtained, produced flower-stems in number as100 to 47, and in average height as 100 to 70. Therefore the crossbetween these two plants was highly beneficial; but how could theirsexual elements have been differentiated by exposure to differentconditions? If the progenitors of the two plants had lived on the samespot during the last score of generations, and had never been crossedwith any plant beyond the distance of a few feet, in all probabilitytheir offspring would have been reduced to the same state as some of theplants in my experiments,--such as the intercrossed plants of the ninthgeneration of Ipomoea,--or the self-fertilised plants of the eighthgeneration of Mimulus,--or the offspring from flowers on the sameplant,--and in this case a cross between the two plants of Digitaliswould have done no good. But seeds are often widely dispersed by naturalmeans, and one of the above two plants or one of their ancestors mayhave come from a distance, from a more shady or sunny, dry or moistplace, or from a different kind of soil containing other organic orinorganic matter. We know from the admirable researches of Messrs. Lawesand Gilbert that different plants require and consume very differentamounts of inorganic matter. (12/10. 'Journal of the Royal AgriculturalSociety of England' volume 24 part 1.) But the amount in the soil wouldprobably not make so great a difference to the several individuals ofany particular species as might at first be expected; for thesurrounding species with different requirements would tend, fromexisting in greater or lesser numbers, to keep each species in a sort ofequilibrium, with respect to what it could obtain from the soil. So itwould be even with respect to moisture during dry seasons; and howpowerful is the influence of a little more or less moisture in the soilon the presence and distribution of plants, is often well shown in oldpasture fields which still retain traces of former ridges and furrows.Nevertheless, as the proportional numbers of the surrounding plants intwo neighbouring places is rarely exactly the same, the individuals ofthe same species will be subjected to somewhat different conditions withrespect to what they can absorb from the soil. It is surprising how thefree growth of one set of plants affects others growing mingled withthem; I allowed the plants on rather more than a square yard of turfwhich had been closely mown for several years, to grow up; and ninespecies out of twenty were thus exterminated; but whether this wasaltogether due to the kinds which grew up robbing the others ofnutriment, I do not know.Seeds often lie dormant for several years in the ground, and germinatewhen brought near the surface by any means, as by burrowing animals.They would probably be affected by the mere circumstance of having longlain dormant; for gardeners believe that the production of doubleflowers and of fruit is thus influenced. Seeds, moreover, which werematured during different seasons, will have been subjected during thewhole course of their development to different degrees of heat andmoisture.It was shown in the last chapter that pollen is often carried by insectsto a considerable distance from plant to plant. Therefore one of theparents or ancestors of our two plants of Digitalis may have beencrossed by a distant plant growing under somewhat different conditions.Plants thus crossed often produce an unusually large number of seeds; astriking instance of this fact is afforded by the Bignonia, previouslymentioned, which was fertilised by Fritz Muller with pollen from someadjoining plants and set hardly any seed, but when fertilised withpollen from a distant plant, was highly fertile. Seedlings from a crossof this kind grow with great vigour, and transmit their vigour to theirdescendants. These, therefore, in the struggle for life, will generallybeat and exterminate the seedlings from plants which have long grownnear together under the same conditions, and will thus tend to spread.When two varieties which present well-marked differences are crossed,their descendants in the later generations differ greatly from oneanother in external characters; and this is due to the augmentation orobliteration of some of these characters, and to the reappearance offormer ones through reversion; and so it will be, as we may feel almostsure, with any slight differences in the constitution of their sexualelements. Anyhow, my experiments indicate that crossing plants whichhave been long subjected to almost though not quite the same conditions,is the most powerful of all the means for retaining some degree ofdifferentiation in the sexual elements, as shown by the superiority inthe later generations of the intercrossed over the self-fertilisedseedlings. Nevertheless, the continued intercrossing of plants thustreated does tend to obliterate such differentiation, as may be inferredfrom the lessened benefit derived from intercrossing such plants, incomparison with that from a cross with a fresh stock. It seems probable,as I may add, that seeds have acquired their endless curious adaptationsfor wide dissemination, not only that the seedlings would thus beenabled to find new and fitting homes, but that the individuals whichhave been long subjected to the same conditions should occasionallyintercross with a fresh stock. (12/11. See Professor Hildebrand'sexcellent treatise 'Verbreitungsmittel der Pflanzen' 1873.)From the foregoing several considerations we may, I think, conclude thatin the above case of the Digitalis, and even in that of plants whichhave grown for thousands of generations in the same district, as mustoften have occurred with species having a much restricted range, we areapt to over-estimate the degree to which the individuals have beensubjected to absolutely the same conditions. There is at least nodifficulty in believing that such plants have been subjected tosufficiently distinct conditions to differentiate their sexual elements;for we know that a plant propagated for some generations in anothergarden in the same district serves as a fresh stock and has highfertilising powers. The curious cases of plants which can fertilise andbe fertilised by any other individual of the same species, but arealtogether sterile with their own pollen, become intelligible, if theview here propounded is correct, namely, that the individuals of thesame species growing in a state of nature near together, have not reallybeen subjected during several previous generations to quite the sameconditions.Some naturalists assume that there is an innate tendency in all beingsto vary and to advance in organisation, independently of externalagencies; and they would, I presume, thus explain the slight differenceswhich distinguish all the individuals of the same species both inexternal characters and in constitution, as well as the greaterdifferences in both respects between nearly allied varieties. No twoindividuals can be found quite alike; thus if we sow a number of seedsfrom the same capsule under as nearly as possible the same conditions,they germinate at different rates and grow more or less vigorously. Theyresist cold and other unfavourable conditions differently. They would inall probability, as we know to be the case with animals of the samespecies, be somewhat differently acted on by the same poison, or by thesame disease. They have different powers of transmitting theircharacters to their offspring; and many analogous facts could be given.(12/12. Vilmorin as quoted by Verlot 'Des Varieties' pages 32, 38, 39.)Now, if it were true that plants growing near together in a state ofnature had been subjected during many previous generations to absolutelythe same conditions, such differences as those just specified would bequite inexplicable; but they are to a certain extent intelligible inaccordance with the views just advanced.As most of the plants on which I experimented were grown in my garden orin pots under glass, a few words must be added on the conditions towhich they were exposed, as well as on the effects of cultivation. Whena species is first brought under culture, it may or may not be subjectedto a change of climate, but it is always grown in ground broken up, andmore or less manured; it is also saved from competition with otherplants. The paramount importance of this latter circumstance is provedby the multitude of species which flourish and multiply in a garden, butcannot exist unless they are protected from other plants. When thussaved from competition they are able to get whatever they require fromthe soil, probably often in excess; and they are thus subjected to agreat change of conditions. It is probably in chief part owing to thiscause that all plants with rare exceptions vary after being cultivatedfor some generations. The individuals which have already begun to varywill intercross one with another by the aid of insects; and thisaccounts for the extreme diversity of character which many of our longcultivated plants exhibit. But it should be observed that the resultwill be largely determined by the degree of their variability and by thefrequency of the intercrosses; for if a plant varies very little, likemost species in a state of nature, frequent intercrosses tend to giveuniformity of character to it.I have attempted to show that with plants growing naturally in the samedistrict, except in the unusual case of each individual being surroundedby exactly the same proportional numbers of other species having certainpowers of absorption, each will be subjected to slightly differentconditions. This does not apply to the individuals of the same specieswhen cultivated in cleared ground in the same garden. But if theirflowers are visited by insects, they will intercross; and this will giveto their sexual elements during a considerable number of generations asufficient amount of differentiation for a cross to be beneficial.Moreover, seeds are frequently exchanged or procured from other gardenshaving a different kind of soil; and the individuals of the samecultivated species will thus be subjected to a change of conditions. Ifthe flowers are not visited by our native insects, or very rarely so, asin the case of the common and sweet pea, and apparently in that of thetobacco when kept in a hothouse, any differentiation in the sexualelements caused by intercrosses will tend to disappear. This appears tohave occurred with the plants just mentioned, for they were notbenefited by being crossed one with another, though they were greatlybenefited by a cross with a fresh stock.I have been led to the views just advanced with respect to the causes ofthe differentiation of the sexual elements and of the variability of ourgarden plants, by the results of my various experiments, and moreespecially by the four cases in which extremely inconstant species,after having been self-fertilised and grown under closely similarconditions for several generations, produced flowers of a uniform andconstant tint. These conditions were nearly the same as those to whichplants, growing in a garden clear of weeds, are subjected, if they arepropagated by self-fertilised seeds on the same spot. The plants in potswere, however, exposed to less severe fluctuations of climate than thoseout of doors; but their conditions, though closely uniform for all theindividuals of the same generation, differed somewhat in the successivegenerations. Now, under these circumstances, the sexual elements of theplants which were intercrossed in each generation retained sufficientdifferentiation during several years for their offspring to be superiorto the self-fertilised, but this superiority gradually and manifestlydecreased, as was shown by the difference in the result between a crosswith one of the intercrossed plants and with a fresh stock. Theseintercrossed plants tended also in a few cases to become somewhat moreuniform in some of their external characters than they were at first.With respect to the plants which were self-fertilised in eachgeneration, their sexual elements apparently lost, after some years, alldifferentiation, for a cross between them did no more good than a crossbetween the flowers on the same plant. But it is a still more remarkablefact, that although the seedlings of Mimulus, Ipomoea, Dianthus, andPetunia which were first raised, varied excessively in the colour oftheir flowers, their offspring, after being self-fertilised and grownunder uniform conditions for some generations, bore flowers almost asuniform in tint as those on a natural species. In one case also theplants themselves became remarkably uniform in height.The conclusion that the advantages of a cross depend altogether on thedifferentiation of the sexual elements, harmonises perfectly with thefact that an occasional and slight change in the conditions of life isbeneficial to all plants and animals. (12/13. I have given sufficientevidence on this head in my 'Variation under Domestication' chapter 18volume 2 2nd edition page 127.) But the offspring from a cross betweenorganisms which have been exposed to different conditions, profit in anincomparably higher degree than do young or old beings from a merechange in the conditions. In this latter case we never see anything likethe effect which generally follows from a cross with another individual,especially from a cross with a fresh stock. This might, perhaps, havebeen expected, for the blending together of the sexual elements of twodifferentiated beings will affect the whole constitution at a very earlyperiod of life, whilst the organisation is highly flexible. We have,moreover, reason to believe that changed conditions generally actdifferently on the several parts or organs of the same individual(12/14. See, for instance, Brackenridge 'Theory of Diathesis' Edinburgh1869.); and if we may further believe that these now slightlydifferentiated parts react on one another, the harmony between thebeneficial effects on the individual due to changed conditions, andthose due to the interaction of differentiated sexual elements, becomesstill closer.That wonderfully accurate observer, Sprengel, who first showed howimportant a part insects play in the fertilisation of flowers, calledhis book 'The Secret of Nature Displayed;' yet he only occasionally sawthat the object for which so many curious and beautiful adaptations havebeen acquired, was the cross-fertilisation of distinct plants; and heknew nothing of the benefits which the offspring thus receive in growth,vigour, and fertility. But the veil of secrecy is as yet far fromlifted; nor will it be, until we can say why it is beneficial that thesexual elements should be differentiated to a certain extent, and why,if the differentiation be carried still further, injury follows. It isan extraordinary fact that with many species, flowers fertilised withtheir own pollen are either absolutely or in some degree sterile; iffertilised with pollen from another flower on the same plant, they aresometimes, though rarely, a little more fertile; if fertilised withpollen from another individual or variety of the same species, they arefully fertile; but if with pollen from a distinct species, they aresterile in all possible degrees, until utter sterility is reached. Wethus have a long series with absolute sterility at the two ends;--at oneend due to the sexual elements not having been sufficientlydifferentiated, and at the other end to their having been differentiatedin too great a degree, or in some peculiar manner.The fertilisation of one of the higher plants depends, in the firstplace, on the mutual action of the pollen-grains and the stigmaticsecretion or tissues, and afterwards on the mutual action of thecontents of the pollen-grains and ovules. Both actions, judging from theincreased fertility of the parent-plants and from the increased powersof growth in the offspring, are favoured by some degree ofdifferentiation in the elements which interact and unite so as to form anew being. Here we have some analogy with chemical affinity orattraction, which comes into play only between atoms or molecules of adifferent nature. As Professor Miller remarks: "Generally speaking, thegreater the difference in the properties of two bodies, the more intenseis their tendency to mutual chemical action...But between bodies of asimilar character the tendency to unite is feeble." (12/15. 'Elements ofChemistry' 4th edition 1867 part 1 page 11. Dr. Frankland informs methat similar views with respect to chemical affinity are generallyaccepted by chemists.) This latter proposition accords well with thefeeble effects of a plant's own pollen on the fertility of themother-plant and on the growth of the offspring; and the formerproposition accords well with the powerful influence in both ways ofpollen from an individual which has been differentiated by exposure tochanged conditions, or by so-called spontaneous variation. But theanalogy fails when we turn to the negative or weak effects of pollenfrom one species on a distinct species; for although some substanceswhich are extremely dissimilar, for instance, carbon and chlorine, havea very feeble affinity for each other, yet it cannot be said that theweakness of the affinity depends in such cases on the extent to whichthe substances differ. It is not known why a certain amount ofdifferentiation is necessary or favourable for the chemical affinity orunion of two substances, any more than for the fertilisation or union oftwo organisms.Mr. Herbert Spencer has discussed this whole subject at great length,and after stating that all the forces throughout nature tend towards anequilibrium, remarks, "that the need of this union of sperm-cell andgerm-ccell is the need for overthrowing this equilibrium andre-establishing active molecular change in the detached germ--a resultwhich is probably effected by mixing the slightly-differentphysiological units of slightly-different individuals." (12/16.'Principles of Biology' volume 1 page 274 1864. In my 'Origin ofSpecies' published in 1859, I spoke of the good effects from slightchanges in the condition of life and from cross-fertilisation, and ofthe evil effects from great changes in the conditions and from crossingwidely distinct forms (i.e., species), as a series of facts "connectedtogether by some common but unknown bond, which is essentially relatedto the principle of life.") But we must not allow this highlygeneralised view, or the analogy of chemical affinity, to conceal fromus our ignorance. We do not know what is the nature or degree of thedifferentiation in the sexual elements which is favourable for union,and what is injurious for union, as in the case of distinct species. Wecannot say why the individuals of certain species profit greatly, andothers very little by being crossed. There are some few species whichhave been self-fertilised for a vast number of generations, and yet arevigorous enough to compete successfully with a host of surroundingplants. We can form no conception why the advantage from a cross issometimes directed exclusively to the vegetative system, and sometimesto the reproductive system, but commonly to both. It is equallyinconceivable why some individuals of the same species should besterile, whilst others are fully fertile with their own pollen; why achange of climate should either lessen or increase the sterility ofself-sterile species; and why the individuals of some species should beeven more fertile with pollen from a distinct species than with theirown pollen. And so it is with many other facts, which are so obscurethat we stand in awe before the mystery of life.Under a practical point of view, agriculturists and horticulturists maylearn something from the conclusions at which we have arrived. Firstly,we see that the injury from the close breeding of animals and from theself-fertilisation of plants, does not necessarily depend on anytendency to disease or weakness of constitution common to the relatedparents, and only indirectly on their relationship, in so far as theyare apt to resemble each other in all respects, including their sexualnature. And, secondly, that the advantages of cross-fertilisation dependon the sexual elements of the parents having become in some degreedifferentiated by the exposure of their progenitors to differentconditions, or from their having intercrossed with individuals thusexposed, or, lastly, from what we call in our ignorance spontaneousvariation. He therefore who wishes to pair closely related animals oughtto keep them under conditions as different as possible. Some fewbreeders, guided by their keen powers of observation, have acted on thisprinciple, and have kept stocks of the same animals at two or moredistant and differently situated farms. They have then coupled theindividuals from these farms with excellent results. (12/17. 'Variationof Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 17 2nd edition volume2 pages 98, 105.) This same plan is also unconsciously followed wheneverthe males, reared in one place, are let out for propagation to breedersin other places. As some kinds of plants suffer much more fromself-fertilisation than do others, so it probably is with animals fromtoo close interbreeding. The effects of close interbreeding on animals,judging again from plants, would be deterioration in general vigour,including fertility, with no necessary loss of excellence of form; andthis seems to be the usual result.It is a common practice with horticulturists to obtain seeds fromanother place having a very different soil, so as to avoid raisingplants for a long succession of generations under the same conditions;but with all the species which freely intercross by aid of insects orthe wind, it would be an incomparably better plan to obtain seeds of therequired variety, which had been raised for some generations under asdifferent conditions as possible, and sow them in alternate rows withseeds matured in the old garden. The two stocks would then intercross,with a thorough blending of their whole organisations, and with no lossof purity to the variety; and this would yield far more favourableresults than a mere exchange of seeds. We have seen in my experimentshow wonderfully the offspring profited in height, weight, hardiness, andfertility, by crosses of this kind. For instance, plants of Ipomoea thuscrossed were to the intercrossed plants of the same stock, with whichthey grew in competition, as 100 to 78 in height, and as 100 to 51 infertility; and plants of Eschscholtzia similarly compared were as 100 to45 in fertility. In comparison with self-fertilised plants the resultsare still more striking; thus cabbages derived from a cross with a freshstock were to the self-fertilised as 100 to 22 in weight.Florists may learn from the four cases which have been fully described,that they have the power of fixing each fleeting variety of colour, ifthey will fertilise the flowers of the desired kind with their ownpollen for half-a-dozen generations, and grow the seedlings under thesame conditions. But a cross with any other individual of the samevariety must be carefully prevented, as each has its own peculiarconstitution. After a dozen generations of self-fertilisation, it isprobable that the new variety would remain constant even if grown undersomewhat different conditions; and there would no longer be anynecessity to guard against intercrosses between the individuals of thesame variety.With respect to mankind, my son George has endeavoured to discover by astatistical investigation whether the marriages of first cousins are atall injurious, although this is a degree of relationship which would notbe objected to in our domestic animals; and he has come to theconclusion from his own researches and those of Dr. Mitchell that theevidence as to any evil thus caused is conflicting, but on the wholepoints to its being very small. From the facts given in this volume wemay infer that with mankind the marriages of nearly related persons,some of whose parents and ancestors had lived under very differentconditions, would be much less injurious than that of persons who hadalways lived in the same place and followed the same habits of life. Norcan I see reason to doubt that the widely different habits of life ofmen and women in civilised nations, especially amongst the upperclasses, would tend to counterbalance any evil from marriages betweenhealthy and somewhat closely related persons.Under a theoretical point of view it is some gain to science to knowthat numberless structures in hermaphrodite plants, and probably inhermaphrodite animals, are special adaptations for securing anoccasional cross between two individuals; and that the advantages fromsuch a cross depend altogether on the beings which are united, or theirprogenitors, having had their sexual elements somewhat differentiated,so that the embryo is benefited in the same manner as is a mature plantor animal by a slight change in its conditions of life, although in amuch higher degree.Another and more important result may be deduced from my observations.Eggs and seeds are highly serviceable as a means of dissemination, butwe now know that fertile eggs can be produced without the aid of themale. There are also many other methods by which organisms can bepropagated asexually. Why then have the two sexes been developed, andwhy do males exist which cannot themselves produce offspring? The answerlies, as I can hardly doubt, in the great good which is derived from thefusion of two somewhat differentiated individuals; and with theexception of the lowest organisms this is possible only by means of thesexual elements, these consisting of cells separated from the body,containing the germs of every part, and capable of being fusedcompletely together.It has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from theunion of two distinct individuals, especially if their progenitors havebeen subjected to very different conditions, have an immense advantagein height, weight, constitutional vigour and fertility over theself-fertilised offspring from one of the same parents. And this fact isamply sufficient to account for the development of the sexual elements,that is, for the genesis of the two sexes.It is a different question why the two sexes are sometimes combined inthe same individual and are sometimes separated. As with many of thelowest plants and animals the conjugation of two individuals which areeither quite similar or in some degree different, is a commonphenomenon, it seems probable, as remarked in the last chapter, that thesexes were primordially separate. The individual which receives thecontents of the other, may be called the female; and the other, which isoften smaller and more locomotive, may be called the male; though thesesexual names ought hardly to be applied as long as the whole contents ofthe two forms are blended into one. The object gained by the two sexesbecoming united in the same hermaphrodite form probably is to allow ofoccasional or frequent self-fertilisation, so as to ensure thepropagation of the species, more especially in the case of organismsaffixed for life to the same spot. There does not seem to be any greatdifficulty in understanding how an organism, formed by the conjugationof two individuals which represented the two incipient sexes, might havegiven rise by budding first to a monoecious and then to an hermaphroditeform; and in the case of animals even without budding to anhermaphrodite form, for the bilateral structure of animals perhapsindicates that they were aboriginally formed by the fusion of twoindividuals.It is a more difficult problem why some plants and apparently all thehigher animals, after becoming hermaphrodites, have since had theirsexes re-separated. This separation has been attributed by somenaturalists to the advantages which follow from a division ofphysiological labour. The principle is intelligible when the same organhas to perform at the same time diverse functions; but it is not obviouswhy the male and female glands when placed in different parts of thesame compound or simple individual, should not perform their functionsequally well as when placed in two distinct individuals. In someinstances the sexes may have been re-separated for the sake ofpreventing too frequent self-fertilisation; but this explanation doesnot seem probable, as the same end might have been gained by other andsimpler means, for instance dichogamy. It may be that the production ofthe male and female reproductive elements and the maturation of theovules was too great a strain and expenditure of vital force for asingle individual to withstand, if endowed with a highly complexorganisation; and that at the same time there was no need for all theindividuals to produce young, and consequently that no injury, on thecontrary, good resulted from half of them, or the males, failing toproduce offspring.There is another subject on which some light is thrown by the factsgiven in this volume, namely, hybridisation. It is notorious that whendistinct species of plants are crossed, they produce with the rarestexceptions fewer seeds than the normal number. This unproductivenessvaries in different species up to sterility so complete that not even anempty capsule is formed; and all experimentalists have found that it ismuch influenced by the conditions to which the crossed species aresubjected. The pollen of each species is strongly prepotent over that ofany other species, so that if a plant's own pollen is placed on thestigma some time after foreign pollen has been applied to it, any effectfrom the latter is quite obliterated. It is also notorious that not onlythe parent species, but the hybrids raised from them are more or lesssterile; and that their pollen is often in a more or less abortedcondition. The degree of sterility of various hybrids does not alwaysstrictly correspond with the degree of difficulty in uniting the parentforms. When hybrids are capable of breeding inter se, their descendantsare more or less sterile, and they often become still more sterile inthe later generations; but then close interbreeding has hitherto beenpractised in all such cases. The more sterile hybrids are sometimes muchdwarfed in stature, and have a feeble constitution. Other facts could begiven, but these will suffice for us. Naturalists formerly attributedall these results to the difference between species being fundamentallydistinct from that between the varieties of the same species; and thisis still the verdict of some naturalists.The results of my experiments in self-fertilising and cross-fertilisingthe individuals or the varieties of the same species, are strikinglyanalogous with those just given, though in a reversed manner. With themajority of species flowers fertilised with their own pollen yieldfewer, sometimes much fewer seeds, than those fertilised with pollenfrom another individual or variety. Some self-fertilised flowers areabsolutely sterile; but the degree of their sterility is largelydetermined by the conditions to which the parent plants have beenexposed, as was well exemplified in the case of Eschscholtzia andAbutilon. The effects of pollen from the same plant are obliterated bythe prepotent influence of pollen from another individual or variety,although the latter may have been placed on the stigma some hoursafterwards. The offspring from self-fertilised flowers are themselvesmore or less sterile, sometimes highly sterile, and their pollen issometimes in an imperfect condition; but I have not met with any case ofcomplete sterility in self-fertilised seedlings, as is so common withhybrids. The degree of their sterility does not correspond with that ofthe parent-plants when first self-fertilised. The offspring ofself-fertilised plants suffer in stature, weight, and constitutionalvigour more frequently and in a greater degree than do the hybridoffspring of the greater number of crossed species. Decreased height istransmitted to the next generation, but I did not ascertain whether thisapplies to decreased fertility.I have elsewhere shown that by uniting in various ways dimorphic ortrimorphic heterostyled plants, which belong to the same undoubtedspecies, we get another series of results exactly parallel with thosefrom crossing distinct species. (12/18. 'Journal of the Linnean SocietyBotany' volume 10 1867 page 393.) Plants illegitimately fertilised withpollen from a distinct plant belonging to the same form, yield fewer,often much fewer seeds, than they do when legitimately fertilised withpollen from a plant belonging to a distinct form. They sometimes yieldno seed, not even an empty capsule, like a species fertilised withpollen from a distinct genus. The degree of sterility is much affectedby the conditions to which the plants have been subjected. (12/19.'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864 page 180.) Thepollen from a distinct form is strongly prepotent over that from thesame form, although the former may have been placed on the stigma manyhours afterwards. The offspring from a union between plants of the sameform are more or less sterile, like hybrids, and have their pollen in amore or less aborted condition; and some of the seedlings are as barrenand as dwarfed as the most barren hybrid. They also resemble hybrids inseveral other respects, which need not here be specified indetail,--such as their sterility not corresponding in degree with thatof the parent plants,--the unequal sterility of the latter, whenreciprocally united,--and the varying sterility of the seedlings raisedfrom the same seed-capsule.We thus have two grand classes of cases giving results which correspondin the most striking manner with those which follow from the crossing ofso-called true and distinct species. With respect to the differencebetween seedlings raised from cross and self-fertilised flowers, thereis good evidence that this depends altogether on whether the sexualelements of the parents have been sufficiently differentiated, byexposure to different conditions or by spontaneous variation. It isprobable that nearly the same conclusion may be extended to heterostyledplants; but this is not the proper place for discussing the origin ofthe long-styled, short-styled and mid-styled forms, which all belong tothe same species as certainly as do the two sexes of the same species.We have therefore no right to maintain that the sterility of specieswhen first crossed and of their hybrid offspring, is determined by somecause fundamentally different from that which determines the sterilityof the individuals both of ordinary and of heterostyled plants whenunited in various ways. Nevertheless, I am aware that it will take manyyears to remove this prejudice.There is hardly anything more wonderful in nature than the sensitivenessof the sexual elements to external influences, and the delicacy of theiraffinities. We see this in slight changes in the conditions of lifebeing favourable to the fertility and vigour of the parents, whilecertain other and not great changes cause them to be quite sterilewithout any apparent injury to their health. We see how sensitive thesexual elements of those plants must be, which are completely sterilewith their own pollen, but are fertile with that of any other individualof the same species. Such plants become either more or less self-sterileif subjected to changed conditions, although the change may be far fromgreat. The ovules of a heterostyled trimorphic plant are affected verydifferently by pollen from the three sets of stamens belonging to thesame species. With ordinary plants the pollen of another variety ormerely of another individual of the same variety is often stronglyprepotent over its own pollen, when both are placed at the same time onthe same stigma. In those great families of plants containing manythousand allied species, the stigma of each distinguishes with unerringcertainty its own pollen from that of every other species.There can be no doubt that the sterility of distinct species when firstcrossed, and of their hybrid offspring, depends exclusively on thenature or affinities of their sexual elements. We see this in the wantof any close correspondence between the degree of sterility and theamount of external difference in the species which are crossed; andstill more clearly in the wide difference in the results of crossingreciprocally the same two species;--that is, when species A is crossedwith pollen from B, and then B is crossed with pollen from A. Bearing inmind what has just been said on the extreme sensitiveness and delicateaffinities of the reproductive system, why should we feel any surpriseat the sexual elements of those forms, which we call species, havingbeen differentiated in such a manner that they are incapable or onlyfeebly capable of acting on one another? We know that species havegenerally lived under the same conditions, and have retained their ownproper characters, for a much longer period than varieties.Long-continued domestication eliminates, as I have shown in my'Variation under Domestication,' the mutual sterility which distinctspecies lately taken from a state of nature almost always exhibit whenintercrossed; and we can thus understand the fact that the mostdifferent domestic races of animals are not mutually sterile. Butwhether this holds good with cultivated varieties of plants is notknown, though some facts indicate that it does. The elimination ofsterility through long-continued domestication may probably beattributed to the varying conditions to which our domestic animals havebeen subjected; and no doubt it is owing to this same cause that theywithstand great and sudden changes in their conditions of life with farless loss of fertility than do natural species. From these severalconsiderations it appears probable that the difference in the affinitiesof the sexual elements of distinct species, on which their mutualincapacity for breeding together depends, is caused by their having beenhabituated for a very long period each to its own conditions, and to thesexual elements having thus acquired firmly fixed affinities. Howeverthis may be, with the two great classes of cases before us, namely,those relating to the self-fertilisation and cross-fertilisation of theindividuals of the same species, and those relating to the illegitimateand legitimate unions of heterostyled plants, it is quite unjustifiableto assume that the sterility of species when first crossed and of theirhybrid offspring, indicates that they differ in some fundamental mannerfrom the varieties or individuals of the same species.INDEX.Abutilon darwinii, self-sterile in Brazil.moderately self-fertile in England.fertilised by birds.Acacia

OF BURGSTEAD AND ITS FOLK AND ITS NEIGHBOURSOnce upon a time amidst the mountains and hills and falling streamsof a fair land there was a town or thorp in a certain valley.  Thiswas well-nigh encompassed by a wall of sheer cliffs; toward the Eastand the great mountains they drew together till they went near tomeet, and left but a narrow path on either side of a stony streamthat came rattling down into the Dale:  toward the river at that endthe hills lowered somewhat, though they still ended in sheer rocks;but up from it, and more especially on the north side, they swelledinto great shoulders of land, then dipped a little, and rose againinto the sides of huge fells clad with pine-woods, and cleft here andthere by deep ghylls:  thence again they rose higher and steeper, andever higher till they drew dark and naked out of the woods to meetthe snow-fields and ice-rivers of the high mountains.  But that wasfar away from the pass by the little river into the valley; and thesaid river was no drain from the snow-fields white and thick with thegrinding of the ice, but clear and bright were its waters that camefrom wells amidst the bare rocky heaths.The upper end of the valley, where it first began to open out fromthe pass, was rugged and broken by rocks and ridges of water-bornestones, but presently it smoothed itself into mere grassy swellingsand knolls, and at last into a fair and fertile plain swelling upinto a green wave, as it were, against the rock-wall whichencompassed it on all sides save where the river came gushing out ofthe strait pass at the east end, and where at the west end it poureditself out of the Dale toward the lowlands and the plain of the greatriver.Now the valley was some ten miles of our measure from that place ofthe rocks and the stone-ridges, to where the faces of the hills drewsomewhat anigh to the river again at the west, and then fell abackalong the edge of the great plain; like as when ye fare a-sailingpast two nesses of a river-mouth, and the main-sea lieth open beforeyou.Besides the river afore-mentioned, which men called the WelteringWater, there were other waters in the Dale.  Near the eastern pass,entangled in the rocky ground was a deep tarn full of cold springsand about two acres in measure, and therefrom ran a stream which fellinto the Weltering Water amidst the grassy knolls.  Black seemed thewaters of that tarn which on one side washed the rocks-wall of theDale; ugly and aweful it seemed to men, and none knew what laybeneath its waters save black mis-shapen trouts that few cared tobring to net or angle:  and it was called the Death-Tarn.Other waters yet there were:  here and there from the hills on bothsides, but especially from the south side, came trickles of waterthat ran in pretty brooks down to the river; and some of these sprangbubbling up amidst the foot-mounds of the sheer-rocks; some had clefta rugged and strait way through them, and came tumbling down into theDale at diverse heights from their faces.  But on the north sideabout halfway down the Dale, one stream somewhat bigger than theothers, and dealing with softer ground, had cleft for itself a widerway; and the folk had laboured this way wider yet, till they had madethem a road running north along the west side of the stream.  Soothto say, except for the strait pass along the river at the easternend, and the wider pass at the western, they had no other way (saveone of which a word anon) out of the Dale but such as mountain goatsand bold cragsmen might take; and even of these but few.This midway stream was called the Wildlake, and the way along itWildlake's Way, because it came to them out of the wood, which onthat north side stretched away from nigh to the lip of the valley-wall up to the pine woods and the high fells on the east and north,and down to the plain country on the west and south.Now when the Weltering Water came out of the rocky tangle near thepass, it was turned aside by the ground till it swung right up to thefeet of the Southern crags; then it turned and slowly bent roundagain northward, and at last fairly doubled back on itself before itturned again to run westward; so that when, after its second double,it had come to flowing softly westward under the northern crags, ithad cast two thirds of a girdle round about a space of land a littlebelow the grassy knolls and tofts aforesaid; and there in that fairspace between the folds of the Weltering Water stood the Thorpwhereof the tale hath told.The men thereof had widened and deepened the Weltering Water aboutthem, and had bridged it over to the plain meads; and athwart thethroat of the space left clear by the water they had built them astrong wall though not very high, with a gate amidst and a tower oneither side thereof.  Moreover, on the face of the cliff which wasbut a stone's throw from the gate they had made them stairs andladders to go up by; and on a knoll nigh the brow had built a watch-tower of stone strong and great, lest war should come into the landfrom over the hills.  That tower was ancient, and therefrom the Thorphad its name and the whole valley also; and it was called Burgsteadin Burgdale.So long as the Weltering Water ran straight along by the northerncliffs after it had left Burgstead, betwixt the water and the cliffswas a wide flat way fashioned by man's hand.  Thus was the wateragain a good defence to the Thorp, for it ran slow and deep there,and there was no other ground betwixt it and the cliffs save thatroad, which was easy to bar across so that no foemen might passwithout battle, and this road was called the Portway.  For a longmile the river ran under the northern cliffs, and then turned intothe midst of the Dale, and went its way westward a broad streamwinding in gentle laps and folds here and there down to the out-gateof the Dale.  But the Portway held on still underneath the rock-wall,till the sheer-rocks grew somewhat broken, and were cumbered withcertain screes, and at last the wayfarer came upon the break in them,and the ghyll through which ran the Wildlake with Wildlake's Waybeside it, but the Portway still went on all down the Dale and awayto the Plain-country.That road in the ghyll, which was neither wide nor smooth, thewayfarer into the wood must follow, till it lifted itself out of theghyll, and left the Wildlake coming rattling down by many steps fromthe east; and now the way went straight north through the woodland,ever mounting higher, (because the whole set of the land was towardthe high fells,) but not in any cleft or ghyll.  The wood itselfthereabout was thick, a blended growth of diverse kinds of trees, butmost of oak and ash; light and air enough came through their boughsto suffer the holly and bramble and eglantine and other small wood togrow together into thickets, which no man could pass without hewing away.  But before it is told whereto Wildlake's Way led, it must besaid that on the east side of the ghyll, where it first began justover the Portway, the hill's brow was clear of wood for a certainspace, and there, overlooking all the Dale, was the Mote-stead of theDalesmen, marked out by a great ring of stones, amidst of which wasthe mound for the Judges and the Altar of the Gods before it.  Andthis was the holy place of the men of the Dale and of other folkwhereof the tale shall now tell.For when Wildlake's Way had gone some three miles from the Mote-stead, the trees began to thin, and presently afterwards was aclearing and the dwellings of men, built of timber as may well bethought.  These houses were neither rich nor great, nor was the folka mighty folk, because they were but a few, albeit body by body theywere stout carles enough.  They had not affinity with the Dalesmen,and did not wed with them, yet it is to be deemed that they weresomewhat akin to them.  To be short, though they were freemen, yet asregards the Dalesmen were they well-nigh their servants; for theywere but poor in goods, and had to lean upon them somewhat.  Notillage they had among those high trees; and of beasts nought savesome flocks of goats and a few asses.  Hunters they were, andcharcoal-burners, and therein the deftest of men, and they couldshoot well in the bow withal:  so they trucked their charcoal andtheir smoked venison and their peltries with the Dalesmen for wheatand wine and weapons and weed; and the Dalesmen gave them main goodpennyworths, as men who had abundance wherewith to uphold theirkinsmen, though they were but far-away kin.  Stout hands had theseWoodlanders and true hearts as any; but they were few-spoken and tothose that needed them not somewhat surly of speech and grim ofvisage:  brown-skinned they were, but light-haired; well-eyed, withbut little red in their cheeks:  their women were not very fair, forthey toiled like the men, or more.  They were thought to be wiserthan most men in foreseeing things to come.  They were much given tospells, and songs of wizardry, and were very mindful of the oldstory-lays, wherein they were far more wordy than in their dailyspeech.  Much skill had they in runes, and were exceeding deft inscoring them on treen bowls, and on staves, and door-posts and roof-beams and standing-beds and such like things.  Many a day when thesnow was drifting over their roofs, and hanging heavy on the tree-boughs, and the wind was roaring through the trees aloft and rattlingabout the close thicket, when the boughs were clattering in the wind,and crashing down beneath the weight of the gathering freezing snow,when all beasts and men lay close in their lairs, would they sit longhours about the house-fire with the knife or the gouge in hand, withthe timber twixt their knees and the whetstone beside them,hearkening to some tale of old times and the days when their bannerwas abroad in the world; and they the while wheedling into growth outof the tough wood knots and blossoms and leaves and the images ofbeasts and warriors and women.They were called nought save the Woodland-Carles in that day, thoughtime had been when they had borne a nobler name:  and their abode wascalled Carlstead.  Shortly, for all they had and all they had not,for all they were and all they were not, they were well-beloved bytheir friends and feared by their foes.Now when Wildlake's Way was gotten to Carlstead, there was an end ofit toward the north; though beyond it in a right line the wood wasthinner, because of the hewing of the Carles.  But the road itselfturned west at once and went on through the wood, till some fourmiles further it first thinned and then ceased altogether, the groundgoing down-hill all the way:  for this was the lower flank of thefirst great upheaval toward the high mountains.  But presently, afterthe wood was ended, the land broke into swelling downs and windingdales of no great height or depth, with a few scattered trees aboutthe hillsides, mostly thorns or scrubby oaks, gnarled and bent andkept down by the western wind:  here and there also were yew-trees,and whiles the hillsides would be grown over with box-wood, but nonevery great; and often juniper grew abundantly.  This then was thecountry of the Shepherds, who were friends both of the Dalesmen andthe Woodlanders.  They dwelt not in any fenced town or thorp, buttheir homesteads were scattered about as was handy for water andshelter.  Nevertheless they had their own stronghold; for amidmost oftheir country, on the highest of a certain down above a bottom wherea willowy stream winded, was a great earthwork:  the walls thereofwere high and clean and overlapping at the entering in, and amidst ofit was a deep well of water, so that it was a very defensible place:and thereto would they drive their flocks and herds when war was inthe land, for nought but a very great host might win it; and thisstronghold they called Greenbury.These Shepherd-Folk were strong and tall like the Woodlanders, forthey were partly of the same blood, but burnt they were both ruddyand brown:  they were of more words than the Woodlanders but yet notmany-worded.  They knew well all those old story-lays, (and thispartly by the minstrelsy of the Woodlanders,) but they had scantskill in wizardry, and would send for the Woodlanders, both men andwomen, to do whatso they needed therein.  They were very hale andlong-lived, whereas they dwelt in clear bright air, and they mostlywent light-clad even in the winter, so strong and merry were they.They wedded with the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen both; at leastcertain houses of them did so.  They grew no corn; nought but a fewpot-herbs, but had their meal of the Dalesmen; and in the summer theydrave some of their milch-kine into the Dale for the abundance ofgrass there; whereas their own hills and bents and winding valleyswere not plenteously watered, except here and there as in the bottomunder Greenbury.  No swine they had, and but few horses, but of sheepvery many, and of the best both for their flesh and their wool.  Yetwere they nought so deft craftsmen at the loom as were the Dalesmen,and their women were not very eager at the weaving, though theyloathed not the spindle and rock.  Shortly, they were merry folkwell-beloved of the Dalesmen, quick to wrath, though it abode notlong with them; not very curious in their houses and halls, whichwere but little, and were decked mostly with the handiwork of theWoodland-Carles their guests; who when they were abiding with them,would oft stand long hours nose to beam, scoring and nicking andhammering, answering no word spoken to them but with aye or no,desiring nought save the endurance of the daylight.  Moreover, thisshepherd-folk heeded not gay raiment over-much, but commonly wentclad in white woollen or sheep-brown weed.But beyond this shepherd-folk were more downs and more, scantilypeopled, and that after a while by folk with whom they had no kinshipor affinity, and who were at whiles their foes.  Yet was there noenduring enmity between them; and ever after war and battle camepeace; and all blood-wites were duly paid and no long feud followed:nor were the Dalesmen and the Woodlanders always in these wars,though at whiles they were.  Thus then it fared with these people.But now that we have told of the folks with whom the Dalesmen hadkinship, affinity, and friendship, tell we of their chief abode,Burgstead to wit, and of its fashion.  As hath been told, it lay uponthe land made nigh into an isle by the folds of the Weltering Watertowards the uppermost end of the Dale; and it was warded by the deepwater, and by the wall aforesaid with its towers.  Now the Dale atits widest, to wit where Wildlake fell into it, was but nine furlongsover, but at Burgstead it was far narrower; so that betwixt the walland the wandering stream there was but a space of fifty acres, andtherein lay Burgstead in a space of the shape of a sword-pommel:  andthe houses of the kinships lay about it, amidst of gardens andorchards, but little ordered into streets and lanes, save that a waywent clean through everything from the tower-warded gate to thebridge over the Water, which was warded by two other towers on itshither side.As to the houses, they were some bigger, some smaller, as thehousemates needed.  Some were old, but not very old, save two only,and some quite new, but of these there were not many:  they were allbuilt fairly of stone and lime, with much fair and curious carvedwork of knots and beasts and men round about the doors; or whiles awale of such-like work all along the house-front.  For as deft aswere the Woodlanders with knife and gouge on the oaken beams, even sodeft were the Dalesmen with mallet and chisel on the face of the hewnstone; and this was a great pastime about the Thorp.  Within thesehouses had but a hall and solar, with shut-beds out from the hall onone side or two, with whatso of kitchen and buttery and out-bower mendeemed handy.  Many men dwelt in each house, either kinsfolk, or suchas were joined to the kindred.Near to the gate of Burgstead in that street aforesaid and facingeast was the biggest house of the Thorp; it was one of the twoabovesaid which were older than any other.  Its door-posts and thelintel of the door were carved with knots and twining stems fairerthan other houses of that stead; and on the wall beside the doorcarved over many stones was an image wrought in the likeness of a manwith a wide face, which was terrible to behold, although it smiled:he bore a bent bow in his hand with an arrow fitted to its string,and about the head of him was a ring of rays like the beams of thesun, and at his feet was a dragon, which had crept, as it were, fromamidst of the blossomed knots of the door-post wherewith the tail ofhim was yet entwined.  And this head with the ring of rays about itwas wrought into the adornment of that house, both within andwithout, in many other places, but on never another house of theDale; and it was called the House of the Face.  Thereof hath the talemuch to tell hereafter, but as now it goeth on to tell of the ways oflife of the Dalesmen.In Burgstead was no Mote-hall or Town-house or Church, such as we wotof in these days; and their market-place was wheresoever any mightchoose to pitch a booth:  but for the most part this was done in thewide street betwixt the gate and the bridge.  As to a meeting-place,were there any small matters between man and man, these would theAlderman or one of the Wardens deal with, sitting in Court with theneighbours on the wide space just outside the Gate:  but if it wereto do with greater matters, such as great manslayings and blood-wites, or the making of war or ending of it, or the choosing of theAlderman and the Wardens, such matters must be put off to the Folk-mote, which could but be held in the place aforesaid where was theDoom-ring and the Altar of the Gods; and at that Folk-mote both theShepherd-Folk and the Woodland-Carles foregathered with the Dalesmen,and duly said their say.  There also they held their great casts andmade offerings to the Gods for the Fruitfulness of the Year, theingathering of the increase, and in Memory of their Forefathers.Natheless at Yule-tide also they feasted from house to house to beglad with the rest of Midwinter, and many a cup drank at those feaststo the memory of the fathers, and the days when the world was widerto them, and their banners fared far afield.But besides these dwellings of men in the field between the wall andthe water, there were homesteads up and down the Dale whereso menfound it easy and pleasant to dwell:  their halls were built of muchthe same fashion as those within the Thorp; but many had a highgarth-wall cast about them, so that they might make a stout defencein their own houses if war came into the Dale.As to their work afield; in many places the Dale was fair with growthof trees, and especially were there long groves of sweet chestnutstanding on the grass, of the fruit whereof the folk had much gain.Also on the south side nigh to the western end was a wood or two ofyew-trees very great and old, whence they gat them bow-staves, forthe Dalesmen also shot well in the bow.  Much wheat and rye theyraised in the Dale, and especially at the nether end thereof.  Applesand pears and cherries and plums they had in plenty; of which trees,some grew about the borders of the acres, some in the gardens of theThorp and the homesteads.  On the slopes that had grown from thebreaking down here and there of the Northern cliffs, and which facedthe South and the Sun's burning, were rows of goodly vines, whereofthe folk made them enough and to spare of strong wine both white andred.As to their beasts; swine they had a many, but not many sheep, sinceherein they trusted to their trucking with their friends theShepherds; they had horses, and yet but a few, for they were stout ingoing afoot; and, had they a journey to make with women big withbabes, or with children or outworn elders, they would yoke their oxento their wains, and go fair and softly whither they would.  But thesaid oxen and all their neat were exceeding big and fair, far otherthan the little beasts of the Shepherd-Folk; they were either dun ofcolour, or white with black horns (and those very great) and blacktail-tufts and ear-tips.  Asses they had, and mules for the paths ofthe mountains to the east; geese and hens enough, and dogs not a few,great hounds stronger than wolves, sharp-nosed, long-jawed, dun ofcolour, shag-haired.As to their wares; they were very deft weavers of wool and flax, andmade a shift to dye the thrums in fair colours; since both woad andmadder came to them good cheap by means of the merchants of the plaincountry, and of greening weeds was abundance at hand.  Good smithsthey were in all the metals:  they washed somewhat of gold out of thesands of the Weltering Water, and copper and tin they fetched fromthe rocks of the eastern mountains; but of silver they saw little,and iron they must buy of the merchants of the plain, who came tothem twice in the year, to wit in the spring and the late autumn justbefore the snows.  Their wares they bought with wool spun and in thefleece, and fine cloth, and skins of wine and young neat both steersand heifers, and wrought copper bowls, and gold and copper by weight,for they had no stamped money.  And they guested these merchantswell, for they loved them, because of the tales they told them of thePlain and its cities, and the manslayings therein, and the fall ofKings and Dukes, and the uprising of Captains.Thus then lived this folk in much plenty and ease of life, though notdelicately nor desiring things out of measure.  They wrought withtheir hands and wearied themselves; and they rested from their toiland feasted and were merry:  to-morrow was not a burden to them, noryesterday a thing which they would fain forget:  life shamed themnot, nor did death make them afraid.As for the Dale wherein they dwelt, it was indeed most fair andlovely, and they deemed it the Blessing of the Earth, and they trodits flowery grass beside its rippled streams amidst its green tree-boughs proudly and joyfully with goodly bodies and merry hearts.CHAPTER II.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND HIS KINDREDTells the tale, that on an evening of late autumn when the weatherwas fair, calm, and sunny, there came a man out of the wood hard bythe Mote-stead aforesaid, who sat him down at the roots of theSpeech-mound, casting down before him a roe-buck which he had justslain in the wood.  He was a young man of three and twenty summers;he was so clad that he had on him a sheep-brown kirtle and leggingsof like stuff bound about with white leather thongs; he bore a short-sword in his girdle and a little axe withal; the sword with fairwrought gilded hilts and a dew-shoe of like fashion to its sheath.He had his quiver at his back and bare in his hand his bow unstrung.He was tall and strong, very fair of fashion both of limbs and face,white-skinned, but for the sun's tanning, and ruddy-cheeked:  hisbeard was little and fine, his hair yellow and curling, cut somewhatclose, but for its length so plenteous, and so thick, that none couldfail to note it.  He had no hat nor hood upon his head, nought but afillet of golden beads.As he sat down he glanced at the dale below him with a well-pleasedlook, and then cast his eyes down to the grass at his feet, as thoughto hold a little longer all unchanged the image of the fair place hehad just seen.  The sun was low in the heavens, and his slant beamsfell yellow all up the dale, gilding the chestnut groves grown duskand grey with autumn, and the black masses of the elm-boughs, andgleaming back here and there from the pools of the Weltering Water.Down in the midmost meadows the long-horned dun kine were movingslowly as they fed along the edges of the stream, and a dog wasbounding about with exceeding swiftness here and there among them.At a sharply curved bight of the river the man could see a littlevermilion flame flickering about, and above it a thin blue veil ofsmoke hanging in the air, and clinging to the boughs of the willowsanear; about it were a dozen menfolk clear to see, some sitting, somestanding, some walking to and fro, but all in company together:  fourof were brown-clad and short-skirted like himself, and from above thehand of one came a flash of light as the sun smote upon the steel ofhis spear.  The others were long-skirted and clad gayer, and amongstthem were red and blue and green and white garments, and they wereclear to be seen for women.  Just as the young man looked up again,those of them who were sitting down rose up, and those that werestrolling drew nigh, and they joined hands together, and fell todancing on the grass, and the dog and another one with him came up tothe dancers and raced about and betwixt them; and so clear to seewere they all and so little, being far away, that they looked likedainty well-wrought puppets.The young man sat smiling at it for a little, and then rose up andshouldered his venison, and went down into Wildlake's Way, andpresently was fairly in the Dale and striding along the Portwaybeside the northern cliffs, whose greyness was gilded yet by the lastrays of the sun, though in a minute or two it would go under thewestern rim.  He went fast and cheerily, murmuring to himselfsnatches of old songs; none overtook him on the road, but he overtookdivers folk going alone or in company toward Burgstead; swains andold men, mothers and maidens coming from the field and the acre, orgoing from house to house; and one or two he met but not many.  Allthese greeted him kindly, and he them again; but he stayed not tospeak with any, but went as one in haste.It was dusk by then he passed under the gate of Burgstead; he wentstraight thence to the door of the House of the Face, and entered asone who is at home, and need go no further, nor abide a bidding.The hall he came into straight out of the open air was long andsomewhat narrow and not right high; it was well-nigh dark now within,but since he knew where to look, he could see by the flicker thatleapt up now and then from the smouldering brands of the hearthamidmost the hall under the luffer, that there were but three mentherein, and belike they were even they whom he looked to find there,and for their part they looked for his coming, and knew his step.He set down his venison on the floor, and cried out in a cheeryvoice:  'Ho, Kettel!  Are all men gone without doors to sleep so nearthe winter-tide, that the Hall is as dark as a cave?  Hither to me!Or art thou also sleeping?'A voice came from the further side of the hearth:  'Yea, lord, asleepI am, and have been, and dreaming; and in my dream I dealt with theflesh-pots and the cake-board, and thou shalt see my dream come truepresently to thy gain.'Quoth another voice:  'Kettel hath had out that share of his dreamalready belike, if the saw sayeth sooth about cooks.  All ye havebeen away, so belike he hath done as Rafe's dog when Rafe ran awayfrom the slain buck.'He laughed therewith, and Kettel with him, and a third voice joinedthe laughter.  The young man also laughed and said:  'Here I bringthe venison which my kinsman desired; but as ye see I have brought itover-late:  but take it, Kettel.  When cometh my father from thestithy?'Quoth Kettel:  'My lord hath been hard at it shaping the Yule-tidesword, and doth not lightly leave such work, as ye wot, but he willbe here presently, for he has sent to bid us dight for supperstraightway.'Said the young man:  'Where are there lords in the dale, Kettel, orhast thou made some thyself, that thou must be always throwing themin my teeth?''Son of the Alderman,' said Kettel, 'ye call me Kettel, which is noname of mine, so why should I not call thee lord, which is no dignityof thine, since it goes well over my tongue from old use and wont?But here comes my mate of the kettle, and the women and lads.  Sitdown by the hearth away from their hurry, and I will fetch thee thehand-water.'The young man sat down, and Kettel took up the venison and went hisways toward the door at the lower end of the hall; but ere he reachedit it opened, and a noisy crowd entered of men, women, boys, anddogs, some bearing great wax candles, some bowls and cups and dishesand trenchers, and some the boards for the meal.The young man sat quiet smiling and winking his eyes at the suddenflood of light let into the dark place; he took in without looking atthis or the other thing the aspect of his Fathers' House, so longfamiliar to him; yet to-night he had a pleasure in it above his wont,and in all the stir of the household; for the thought of the woodwherein he had wandered all day yet hung heavy upon him.  Came one ofthe girls and cast fresh brands on the smouldering fire and stirredit into a blaze, and the wax candles were set up on the dais, so thatbetween them and the mew-quickened fire every corner of the hall wasbright.  As aforesaid it was long and narrow, over-arched with stoneand not right high, the windows high up under the springing of theroof-arch and all on the side toward the street; over against themwere the arches of the shut-beds of the housemates.  The walls werebare that evening, but folk were wont to hang up hallings of wovenpictures thereon when feasts and high-days were toward; and all alongthe walls were the tenter-hooks for that purpose, and divers weaponsand tools were hanging from them here and there.  About the daisbehind the thwart-table were now stuck for adornment leavy boughs ofoak now just beginning to turn with the first frosts.  High up on thegable wall above the tenter-hooks for the hangings were carven fairimagery and knots and twining stems; for there in the hewn atone wasset forth that same image with the rayed head that was on the outsidewall, and he was smiting the dragon and slaying him; but here insidethe house all this was stained in fair and lively colours, and thesun-like rays round the head of the image were of beaten gold.  Atthe lower end of the hall were two doors going into the butteries,and kitchen, and other out-bowers; and above these doors was a loftupborne by stone pillars, which loft was the sleeping chamber of thegoodman of the house; but the outward door was halfway between thesaid loft and the hearth of the hall.So the young man took the shoes from his feet and then sat watchingthe women and lads arraying the boards, till Kettel came again to himwith an old woman bearing the ewer and basin, who washed his feet andpoured the water over his hands, and gave him the towel with fair-broidered ends to dry them withal.Scarce had he made an end of this ere through the outer door came inthree men and a young woman with them; the foremost of these was aman younger by some two years than the first-comer, but so like himthat none might misdoubt that he was his brother; the next was an oldman with a long white beard, but hale and upright; and lastly came aman of middle-age, who led the young woman by the hand.  He wastaller than the first of the young men, though the other who enteredwith him outwent him in height; a stark carle he was, broad acrossthe shoulders, thin in the flank, long-armed and big-handed; verynoble and well-fashioned of countenance, with a straight nose andgrey eyes underneath a broad brow:  his hair grown somewhat scantywas done about with a fillet of golden beads like the young men hissons.  For indeed this was their father, and the master of the House.His name was Iron-face, for he was the deftest of weapon-smiths, andhe was the Alderman of the Dalesmen, and well-beloved of them; hiskindred was deemed the noblest of the Dale, and long had they dweltin the House of the Face.  But of his sons the youngest, the new-comer, was named Hall-face, and his brother the elder Face-of-god;which name was of old use amongst the kindred, and many great men andstout warriors had borne it aforetime:  and this young man, in greatlove had he been gotten, and in much hope had he been reared, andtherefore had he been named after the best of the kindred.  But hismother, who was hight the Jewel, and had been a very fair woman, wasdead now, and Iron-face lacked a wife.Face-of-god was well-beloved of his kindred and of all the Folk ofthe Dale, and he had gotten a to-name, and was called Gold-manebecause of the abundance and fairness of his hair.As for the young woman that was led in by Iron-face, she was thebetrothed of Face-of-god, and her name was the Bride.  She lookedwith such eyes of love on him when she saw him in the hall, as thoughshe had never seen him before but once, nor loved him but sinceyesterday; though in truth they had grown up together and had seeneach other most days of the year for many years.  She was of thekindred with whom the chiefs and great men of the Face mostly wedded,which was indeed far away kindred of them.  She was a fair woman andstrong:  not easily daunted amidst perils she was hardy and handy andlight-foot:  she could swim as well as any, and could shoot well inthe bow, and wield sword and spear:  yet was she kind andcompassionate, and of great courtesy, and the very dogs and kinetrusted in her and loved her.  Her hair was dark red of hue, long andfine and plenteous, her eyes great and brown, her brow broad and veryfair, her lips fine and red:  her cheek not ruddy, yet nowise sallow,but clear and bright:  tall she was and of excellent fashion, butwell-knit and well-measured rather than slender and wavering as thewillow-bough.  Her voice was sweet and soft, her words few, butexceeding dear to the listener.  In short, she was a woman born to bethe ransom of her Folk.Now as to the names which the menfolk of the Face bore, and they anancient kindred, a kindred of chieftains, it has been said that intimes past their image of the God of the Earth had over his treenface a mask of beaten gold fashioned to the shape of the image; andthat when the Alderman of the Folk died, he to wit who served the Godand bore on his arm the gold-ring between the people and the altar,this visor or face of God was laid over the face of him who had beenin a manner his priest, and therewith he was borne to mound; and thenew Alderman and priest had it in charge to fashion a new visor forthe God; and whereas for long this great kindred had been chieftainsof the people, they had been, and were all so named, that the wordFace was ever a part of their names.CHAPTER III.  THEY TALK OF DIVERS MATTERS IN THE HALLNow Face-of-god, who is also called Gold-mane, rose up to meet thenew-comers, and each of them greeted him kindly, and the Bride kissedhim on the cheek, and he her in likewise; and he looked kindly onher, and took her hand, and went on up the hall to the dais,following his father and the old man; as for him, he was of thekindred of the House, and was foster-father of Iron-face and of hissons both; and his name was Stone-face:  a stark warrior had he beenwhen he was young, and even now he could do a man's work in thebattlefield, and his understanding was as good as that of a man inhis prime.  So went these and four others up on to the dais and satdown before the thwart-table looking down the hall, for the meat wasnow on the board; and of the others there were some fifty men andwomen who were deemed to be of the kindred and sat at the endlongtables.So then the Alderman stood up and made the sign of the Hammer overthe meat, the token of his craft and of his God.  Then they fell towith good hearts, for there was enough and to spare of meat anddrink.  There was bread and flesh (though not Gold-mane's venison),and leeks and roasted chestnuts of the grove, and red-cheeked applesof the garth, and honey enough of that year's gathering, and medlarssharp and mellow:  moreover, good wine of the western bents went upand down the hall in great gilded copper bowls and in mazers girt andlipped with gold.But when they were full of meat, and had drunken somewhat, they fellto speech, and Iron-face spake aloud to his son, who had but beenspeaking softly to the Bride as one playmate to the other:  but theAlderman said:  'Scarce are the wood-deer grown, kinsman, when I mustneeds eat sheep's flesh on a Thursday, though my son has lain abroadin the woods all night to hunt for me.'And therewith he smiled in the young man's face; but Gold-manereddened and said:  'So is it, kinsman, I can hit what I can see; butnot what is hidden.'Iron-face laughed and said:  'Hast thou been to the Woodland-Carles?are their women fairer than our cousins?'Face-of-god took up the Bride's hand in his and kissed it and laid itto his cheek; and then turned to his father and said:  'Nay, father,I saw not the Wood-carles, nor went to their abode; and on no day doI lust after their women.  Moreover, I brought home a roebuck of thefattest; but I was over-late for Kettel, and the flesh was ready forthe board by then I came.''Well, son,' quoth Iron-face, for he was merry, 'a roebuck is but alittle deer for such big men as are thou and I.  But I rede thee takethe Bride along with thee the next time; and she shall seek whilestthou sleepest, and hit when thou missest.'Then Face-of-god smiled, but he frowned somewhat also, and he said:'Well were that, indeed!  But if ye must needs drag a true tale outof me:  that roebuck I shot at the very edge of the wood nigh to theMote-stead as I was coming home:  harts had I seen in the wood andits lawns, and boars, and bucks, and loosed not at them:  for indeedwhen I awoke in the morning in that wood-lawn ye wot of, I wanderedup and down with my bow unbent.  So it was that I fared as if I wereseeking something, I know not what, that should fill up somethinglacking to me, I know not what.  Thus I felt in myself even so longas I was underneath the black boughs, and there was none beside meand before me, and none to turn aback to:  but when I came out againinto the sunshine, and I saw the fair dale, and the happy abode lyingbefore me, and folk abroad in the meads merry in the eventide; thenwas I full fain of it, and loathed the wood as an empty thing thathad nought to give me; and lo you! all that I had been longing for inthe wood, was it not in this House and ready to my hand?--and that isgood meseemeth.'Therewith he drank of the cup which the Bride put into his hand aftershe had kissed the rim, but when he had set it down again he spakeonce more:'And yet now I am sitting honoured and well-beloved in the House ofmy Fathers, with the holy hearth sparkling and gleaming down therebefore me; and she that shall bear my children sitting soft and kindby my side, and the bold lads I shall one day lead in battle drinkingout of my very cup:  now it seems to me that amidst all this, thedark cold wood, wherein abide but the beasts and the Foes of theGods, is bidding me to it and drawing me thither.  Narrow is the Daleand the World is wide; I would it were dawn and daylight, that Imight be afoot again.'And he half rose up from his place.  But his father bent his brow onhim and said:  'Kinsman, thou hast a long tongue for a half-trainedwhelp:  nor see I whitherward thy mind is wandering, but if it be onthe road of a lad's desire to go further and fare worse.  Hearkenthen, I will offer thee somewhat!  Soon shall the West-countrymerchants be here with their winter truck.  How sayest thou? hastthou a mind to fare back with them, and look on the Plain and itsCities, and take and give with the strangers?  To whom indeed thoushalt be nothing save a purse with a few lumps of gold in it, ormaybe a spear in the stranger's band on the stricken field, or a bowon the wall of an alien city.  This is a craft which thou mayst welllearn, since thou shalt be a chieftain; a craft good to learn,however grievous it be in the learning.  And I myself have beenthere; for in my youth I desired sore to look on the world beyond themountains; so I went, and I filled my belly with the fruit of my owndesires, and a bitter meat was that; but now that it has passedthrough me, and I yet alive, belike I am more of a grown man forhaving endured its gripe.  Even so may it well be with thee, son; sogo if thou wilt; and thou shalt go with my blessing, and with goldand wares and wain and spearmen.''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'I thank thee, for it is well offered; but Iwill not go, for I have no lust for the Plain and its Cities; I lovethe Dale well, and all that is round about it; therein will I liveand die.'Therewith he fell a-musing; and the Bride looked at him anxiously,but spake not.  Sooth to say her heart was sinking, as though sheforeboded some new thing, which should thrust itself into their merrylife.But the old man Stone-face took up the word and said:'Son Gold-mane, it behoveth me to speak, since belike I know thewild-wood better than most, and have done for these three-score andten years; to my cost.  Now I perceive that thou longest for the woodand the innermost of it; and wot ye what?  This longing will atwhiles entangle the sons of our chieftains, though this Alderman thatnow is hath been free therefrom, which is well for him.  For, timewas this longing came over me, and I went whither it led me:overlong it were to tell of all that befell me because of it, and howmy heart bled thereby.  So sorry were the tidings that came of it,that now meseemeth my heart should be of stone and not my face, hadit not been for the love wherewith I have loved the sons of thekindred.  Therefore, son, it were not ill if ye went west away withthe merchants this winter, and learned the dealings of the cities,and brought us back tales thereof.'But Gold-mane cried out somewhat angrily, 'I tell thee, foster-father, that I have no mind for the cities and their men and theirfools and their whores and their runagates.  But as for the wood andits wonders, I have done with it, save for hunting there along withothers of the Folk.  So let thy mind be at ease; and for the rest, Iwill do what the Alderman commandeth, and whatso my father craveth ofme.''And that is well, son,' said Stone-face, 'if what ye say come topass, as sore I misdoubt me it will not.  But well it were, well itwere!  For such things are in the wood, yea and before ye come to itsinnermost, as may well try the stoutest heart.  Therein are Kobbolds,and Wights that love not men, things unto whom the grief of men is asthe sound of the fiddle-bow unto us.  And there abide the ghosts ofthose that may not rest; and there wander the dwarfs and themountain-dwellers, the dealers in marvels, the givers of gifts thatdestroy Houses; the forgers of the curse that clingeth and the murderthat flitteth to and fro.  There moreover are the lairs of Wights inthe shapes of women, that draw a young man's heart out of his body,and fill up the empty place with desire never to be satisfied, thatthey may mock him therewith and waste his manhood and destroy him.Nor say I much of the strong-thieves that dwell there, since thou arta valiant sword; or of them who have been made Wolves of the HolyPlaces; or of the Murder-Carles, the remnants and off-scourings ofwicked and wretched Folks--men who think as much of the life of a manas of the life of a fly.  Yet happiest is the man whom they shalltear in pieces, than he who shall live burdened by the curse of theFoes of the Gods.'The housemaster looked on his son as the old carle spake, and a cloudgathered on his face a while; and when Stone-face had made an end hespake:'This is long and evil talk for the end of a merry day, O fosterer!Wilt thou not drink a draught, O Redesman, and then stand up and setthy fiddle-bow a-dancing, and cause it draw some fair words after it?For my cousin's face hath grown sadder than a young maid's should be,and my son's eyes gleam with thoughts that are far away from us andabroad in the wild-wood seeking marvels.'Then arose a man of middle-age from the top of the endlong bench onthe east side of the hall:  a man tall, thin and scant-haired, with anose like an eagle's neb:  he reached out his hand for the bowl, andwhen they had given to him he handled it, and raised it aloft andcried:'Here I drink a double health to Face-of-god and the Bride, and thelove that lieth between them, and the love betwixt them twain andus.'He drank therewith, and the wine went up and down the hall, and allmen drank, both carles and queens, with shouting and great joy.  ThenRedesman put down the cup (for it had come into his hands again), andreached his hand to the wall behind him, and took down his fiddlehanging there in its case, and drew it out and fell to tuning it,while the hall grew silent to hearken:  then he handled the bow andlaid it on the strings till they wailed and chuckled sweetly, andwhen the song was well awake and stirring briskly, then he lifted uphis voice and sang:The Minstrel saith:'O why on this morning, ye maids, are ye tripping   Aloof from the meadows yet fresh with the dew,Where under the west wind the river is lipping   The fragrance of mint, the white blooms and the blue?For rough is the Portway where panting ye wander;   On your feet and your gown-hems the dust lieth dun;Come trip through the grass and the meadow-sweet yonder,   And forget neath the willows the sword of the sun.The Maidens answer:Though fair are the moon-daisies down by the river,   And soft is the grass and the white clover sweet;Though twixt us and the rock-wall the hot glare doth quiver,   And the dust of the wheel-way is dun on our feet;Yet here on the way shall we walk on this morning   Though the sun burneth here, and sweet, cool is the mead;For here when in old days the Burg gave its warning,   Stood stark under weapons the doughty of deed.Here came on the aliens their proud words a-crying,   And here on our threshold they stumbled and fell;Here silent at even the steel-clad were lying,   And here were our mothers the story to tell.Here then on the morn of the eve of the wedding   We pray to the Mighty that we too may bearSuch war-walls for warding of orchard and steading,   That the new days be merry as old days were dear.'Therewith he made an end, and shouts and glad cries arose all aboutthe hall; and an old man arose and cried:  'A cup to the memory ofthe Mighty of the Day of the Warding of the Ways.'  For you must knowthis song told of a custom of the Folk, held in memory of a time ofbygone battle, wherein they had overthrown a great host of aliens onthe Portway betwixt the river and the cliffs, two furlongs from thegate of Burgstead.  So now two weeks before Midsummer those maidenswho were presently to be wedded went early in the morning to thatplace clad in very fair raiment, swords girt to their sides andspears in their hands, and abode there on the highway from morn tilleven as though they were a guard to it.  And they made merry there,singing songs and telling tales of times past:  and at the sunsettingtheir grooms came to fetch them away to the Feast of the Eve of theWedding.While the song was a-singing Face-of-god took the Bride's hand in hisand caressed it, and was soft and blithe with her; and she reddenedand trembled for pleasure, and called to mind wedding feasts that hadbeen, and fair brides that she had seen thereat, and she forgot herfears and her heart was at peace again.And Iron-face looked well-pleased on the two from time to time, andsmiled, but forbore words to them.But up and down the hall men talked with one another about thingslong ago betid:  for their hearts were high and they desired deeds;but in that fair Dale so happy were the years from day to day thatthere was but little to tell of.  So deepened the night and waned,and Gold-mane and the Bride still talked sweetly together, and atwhiles kindly to the others; and by seeming he had clean forgottenthe wood and its wonders.Then at last the Alderman called for the cup of good-night, and mendrank thereof and went their ways to bed.CHAPTER IV.  FACE-OF-GOD FARETH TO THE WOOD AGAINWhen it was the earliest morning and dawn was but just beginning,Face-of-god awoke and rose up from his bed, and came forth into thehall naked in his shirt, and stood by the hearth, wherein the piled-up embers were yet red, and looked about and could see nothingstirring in the dimness:  then he fetched water and washed the night-tide off him, and clad himself in haste, and was even as he wasyesterday, save that he left his bow and quiver in their place andtook instead a short casting-spear; moreover he took a leathern scripand went therewith to the buttery, and set therein bread and fleshand a little gilded beaker; and all this he did with but littlenoise; for he would not be questioned, lest he should have to answerhimself as well as others.Thus he went quietly out of doors, for the door was but latched,since no bolts or bars or locks were used in Burgstead, and throughthe town-gate, which stood open, save when rumours of war were about.He turned his face straight towards Wildlake's Way, walking briskly,but at whiles looking back over his shoulder toward the East to notewhat way was made by the dawning, and how the sky lightened above themountain passes.By then he was come to the place where the Maiden Ward was held inthe summer the dawn was so far forward that all things had their duecolours, and were clear to see in the shadowless day.  It was abright morning, with an easterly air stirring that drave away thehaze and dried the meadows, which had otherwise been rimy; for it wascold.  Gold-mane lingered on the place a little, and his eyes fell onthe road, as dusty yet as in Redesman's song; for the autumn had beenvery dry, and the strip of green that edged the outside of the waywas worn and dusty also.  On the edge of it, half in the dusty road,half on the worn grass, was a long twine of briony red-berried andblack-leaved; and right in the midst of the road were two twigs ofgreat-leaved sturdy pollard oak, as though they had been thrown asidethere yesterday by women or children a-sporting; and the deep whitedust yet held the marks of feet, some bare, some shod, crossing eachother here and there.  Face-of-god smiled as he passed on, as a manwith a happy thought; for his mind showed him a picture of the Brideas she would be leading the Maiden Ward next summer, and singingfirst among the singers, and he saw her as clearly as he had oftenseen her verily, and before him was the fashion of her hands and allher body, and the little mark on her right wrist, and the place whereher arm whitened, because the sleeve guarded it against the sun,which had long been pleasant unto him, and the little hollow in herchin, and the lock of red-brown hair waving in the wind above herbrow, and shining in the sun as brightly as the Alderman's cunningestwork of golden wire.  Soft and sweet seemed that picture, till healmost seemed to hear her sweet voice calling to him, and desire ofher so took hold of the youth, that it stirred him up to go swiftlieras he strode on, the day brightening behind him.Now was it nigh sunrise, and he began to meet folk on the way, thoughnot many; since for most their way lay afield, and not towards theBurg.  The first was a Woodlander, tall and gaunt, striding besidehis ass, whose panniers were laden with charcoal.  The carle'sdaughter, a little maiden of seven winters, riding on the ass's backbetwixt the panniers, and prattling to herself in the cold morning;for she was pleased with the clear light in the east, and the smoothwide turf of the meadows, as one who had not often been far from theshadow of the heavy trees of the wood, and their dark wall roundabout the clearing where they dwelt.  Face-of-god gave the twain thesele of the day in merry fashion as he passed them by, and the soberdark-faced man nodded to him but spake no word, and the child stayedher prattle to watch him as he went by.Then came the sound of the rattle of wheels, and, as he doubled anangle of the rock-wall, he came upon a wain drawn by four dun kine,wherein lay a young woman all muffled up against the cold with fursand cloths; beside the yoke-beasts went her man, a well-knit trim-faced Dalesman clad bravely in holiday raiment, girt with a goodlysword, bearing a bright steel helm on his head, in his hand a longspear with a gay red and white shaft done about with copper bands.He looked merry and proud of his wain-load, and the woman was smilingkindly on him from out of her scarlet and fur; but now she turned aweary happy face on Gold-mane, for they knew him, as did all men ofthe Dale.So he stopped when they met, for the goodman had already stayed hisslow beasts, and the goodwife had risen a little on her cushions togreet him, yet slowly and but a little, for she was great with child,and not far from her time.  That knew Gold-mane well, and what wastoward, and why the goodman wore his fine clothes, and why the wainwas decked with oak-boughs and the yoke-beasts with their best gildedbells and copper-adorned harness.  For it was a custom with many ofthe kindreds that the goodwife should fare to her father's house tolie in with her first babe, and the day of her coming home was made agreat feast in the house.  So then Face-of-god cried out:  'Hail tothee, O Warcliff!  Shrewd is the wind this morning, and thou dostwell to heed it carefully, this thine orchard, this thy garden, thisthy fair apple-tree!  To a good hall thou wendest, and the Wine ofIncrease shall be sweet there this even.'Then smiled Warcliff all across his face, and the goodwife hung herhead and reddened.  Said the goodman:  'Wilt thou not be with us, sonof the Alderman, as surely thy father shall be?''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'though I were fain of it:  my own matterscarry me away.''What matters?' said Warcliff; 'perchance thou art for the citiesthis autumn?'Face-of-god answered somewhat stiffly:  'Nay, I am not;' and thenmore kindly, and smiling, 'All roads lead not down to the Plain,friend.''What road then farest thou away from us?' said the goodwife.'The way of my will,' he answered.'And what way is that?' said she; 'take heed, lest I get a longing toknow.  For then must thou needs tell me, or deal with the carle therebeside thee.''Nay, goodwife,' said Face-of-god, 'let not that longing take thee;for on that matter I am even as wise as thou.  Now good speed to theeand to the new-comer!'Therewith he went close up to the wain, and reached out his hand toher, and she gave him hers and he kissed it, and so went his wayssmiling kindly on them.  Then the carle cried to his kine, and theybent down their heads to the yoke; and presently, as he walked on, heheard the rumble of the wain mingling with the tinkling of theirbells, which in a little while became measured and musical, andsounded above the creaking of the axles and the rattle of the gearand the roll of the great wheels over the road:  and so it grewthinner and thinner till it all died away behind him.He was now come to where the river turned away from the sheer rock-wall, which was not so high there as in most other places, as therehad been in old time long screes from the cliff, which had now growntogether, with the waxing of herbs and the washing down of the earthon to them, and made a steady slope or low hill going down riverward.Over this the road lifted itself above the level of the meadows,keeping a little way from the cliffs, while on the other side itsbank was somewhat broken and steep here and there.  As Face-of-godcame up to one of these broken places, the sun rose over the easternpass, and the meadows grew golden with its long beams.  He lingered,and looked back under his hand, and as he did so heard the voices andlaughter of women coming up from the slope below him, and presently ayoung woman came struggling up the broken bank with hand and knee,and cast herself down on the roadside turf laughing and panting.  Shewas a long-limbed light-made woman, dark-faced and black-haired:amidst her laughter she looked up and saw Gold-mane, who had stoppedat once when he saw her; she held out her hands to him, and saidlightly, though her face flushed withal:'Come hither, thou, and help the others to climb the bank; for theyare beaten in the race, and now must they do after my will; that wasthe forfeit.'He went up to her, and took her hands and kissed them, as was thecustom of the Dale, and said:'Hail to thee, Long-coat! who be they, and whither away this morningearly?'She looked hard at him, and fondly belike, as she answered slowly:'They be the two maidens of my father's house, whom thou knowest; andour errand, all three of us, is to Burgstead, the Feast of the Wineof Increase which shall be drunk this even.'As she spake came another woman half up the bank, to whom went Face-of-god, and, taking her hands, drew her up while she laughed merrilyin his face:  he saluted her as he had Long-coat, and then with alaugh turned about to wait for the third; who came indeed, but aftera little while, for she had abided, hearing their voices.  Her alsoGold-mane drew up, and kissed her hands, and she lay on the grass byLong-coat, but the second maiden stood up beside the young man.  Shewas white-skinned and golden-haired, a very fair damsel, whereas thelast-comer was but comely, as were well-nigh all the women of theDale.Said Face-of-god, looking on the three:  'How comes it, maidens, thatye are but in your kirtles this sharp autumn morning? or where haveye left your gowns or your cloaks?'For indeed they were clad but in close-fitting blue kirtles of finewool, embroidered about the hems with gold and coloured threads.The last-comer laughed and said:  'What ails thee, Gold-mane, to beso careful of us, as if thou wert our mother or our nurse?  Yet ifthou must needs know, there hang our gowns on the thorn-bush downyonder; for we have been running a match and a forfeit; to wit, thatshe who was last on the highway should go down again and bring themup all three; and now that is my day's work:  but since thou arthere, Alderman's son, thou shalt go down instead of me and fetch themup.'But he laughed merrily and outright, and said:  'That will I not, forthere be but twenty-four hours in the day, and what between eatingand drinking and talking to fair maidens, I have enough to do inevery one of them.  Wasteful are ye women, and simple is yourforfeit.  Now will I, who am the Alderman's son, give forth a doom,and will ordain that one of you fetch up the gowns yourselves, andthat Long-coat be the one; for she is the fleetest-footed and ablestthereto.  Will ye take my doom? for later on I shall not be wiser.''Yea,' said the fair woman, 'not because thou art the Alderman's son,but because thou art the fairest man of the Dale, and mayst bid uspoor souls what thou wilt.'Face-of-god reddened at her words, and the speaker and the last-comerlaughed; but Long-coat held her peace:  she cast one very sober lookon him, and then ran lightly down the bent; he drew near the edge ofit, and watched her going; for her light-foot slimness was fair tolook on:  and he noted that when she was nigh the thorn-bush whereonhung the bright-broidered gowns, and deemed belike that she was notseen, she kissed both her hands where he had kissed them erst.Thereat he drew aback and turned away shyly, scarce looking at theother twain, who smiled on him with somewhat jeering looks; but hebade them farewell and departed speedily; and if they spoke, it wasbut softly, for he heard their voices no more.He went on under the sunlight which was now gilding the outstandingstones of the cliffs, and still his mind was set upon the Bride; andhis meeting with the mother of the yet unborn baby, and with thethree women with their freshness and fairness, did somehow turn histhought the more upon her, since she was the woman who was to be hisamongst all women, for she was far fairer than any one of them; andthrough all manner of life and through all kinds of deeds would he bewith her, and know more of her fairness and kindness than any othercould:  and him-seemed he could see pictures of her and of him amidstall these deeds and ways.Now he went very swiftly; for he was eager, though he knew not forwhat, and he thought but little of the things on which his eyes fell.He met none else on the road till he was come to Wildlake's Way,though he saw folk enough down in the meadows; he was soon amidst thefirst of the trees, and without making any stay set his face east andsomewhat north, that is, toward the slopes that led to the greatmountains.  He said to himself aloud, as he wended the wood:'Strange! yestereven I thought much of the wood, and I set my mind onnot going thither, and this morning I thought nothing of it, and heream I amidst its trees, and wending towards its innermost.'His way was easy at first, because the wood for a little space wasall of beech, so that there was no undergrowth, and he went lightlybetwixt the tall grey and smooth boles; albeit his heart was noughtso gay as it was in the dale amidst the sunshine.  After a while thebeech-wood grew thinner, and at last gave out altogether, and he cameinto a space of rough broken ground with nought but a few scrubbyoaks and thorn-bushes growing thereon here and there.  The sun washigh in the heavens now, and shone brightly down on the waste, thoughthere were a few white clouds high up above him.  The rabbitsscuttled out of the grass before him; here and there he turned asidefrom a stone on which lay coiled an adder sunning itself; now andagain both hart and hind bounded away from before him, or a sounderof wild swine ran grunting away toward closer covert.  But nought didhe see but the common sights and sounds of the woodland; nor did helook for aught else, for he knew this part of the woodlandindifferent well.He held on over this treeless waste for an hour or more, when theground began to be less rugged, and he came upon trees again, butthinly scattered, oak and ash and hornbeam not right great, withthickets of holly and blackthorn between them.  The set of the groundwas still steadily up to the east and north-east, and he followed itas one who wendeth an assured way.  At last before him seemed to risea wall of trees and thicket; but when he drew near to it, lo! anopening in a certain place, and a little path as if men were wont tothread the tangle of the wood thereby; though hitherto he had notedno slot of men, nor any sign of them, since he had plunged into thedeep of the beech-wood.  He took the path as one who needs must, andwent his ways as it led.  In sooth it was well-nigh blind, but he wasa deft woodsman, and by means of it skirted many a close thicket thathad otherwise stayed him.  So on he went, and though the boughs wereclose enough overhead, and the sun came through but in flecks, hejudged that it was growing towards noon, and he wotted well that hewas growing aweary.  For he had been long afoot, and the more part ofthe time on a rough way, or breasting a slope which was at whilessteep enough.At last the track led him skirting about an exceeding close thicketinto a small clearing, through which ran a little woodland rillamidst rushes and dead leaves:  there was a low mound near theeastern side of this wood-lawn, as though there had been once adwelling of man there, but no other sign or slot of man was there.So Face-of-god made stay in that place, casting himself down besidethe rill to rest him and eat and drink somewhat.  Whatever thoughtshad been with him through the wood (and they been many) concerninghis House and his name, and his father, and the journey he might maketo the cities of the Westland, and what was to befall him when he waswedded, and what war or trouble should be on his hands--all this wasnow mingled together and confused by this rest amidst his weariness.He laid down his scrip, and drew his meat from it and ate what hewould, and dipping his gilded beaker into the brook, drank watersmacking of the damp musty savour of the woodland; and then his headsank back on a little mound in the short turf, and he fell asleep atonce.  A long dream he had in short space; and therein were blent histhoughts of the morning with the deeds of yesterday; and othermatters long forgotten in his waking hours came back to his slumberin unordered confusion:  all which made up for him pictures clear,but of little meaning, save that, as oft befalls in dreams, whateverhe was a-doing he felt himself belated.When he awoke, smiling at something strange in his gone-by dream, helooked up to the heavens, thinking to see signs of the even at hand,for he seemed to have been dreaming so long.  The sky was thinlyovercast by now, but by his wonted woodcraft he knew the whereaboutsof the sun, and that it was scant an hour after noon.  He sat theretill he was wholly awake, and then drank once more of the woodlandwater; and he said to himself, but out loud, for he was fain of thesound of a man's voice, though it were but his own:'What is mine errand hither?  Whither wend I?  What shall I have doneto-morrow that I have hitherto left undone?  Or what manner of manshall I be then other than I am now?'Yet though he said the words he failed to think the thought, or itleft him in a moment of time, and he thought but of the Bride and herkindness.  Yet that abode with him but a moment, and again he sawhimself and those two women on the highway edge, and Long-coatlingering on the slope below, kissing his kisses on her hands; and hewas sorry that she desired him over-much, for she was a fair womanand a friendly.  But all that also flowed from him at once, and hehad no thought in him but that he also desired something that helacked:  and this was a burden to him, and he rose up frowning, andsaid to himself, 'Am I become a mere sport of dreams, whether I sleepor wake?  I will go backward--or forward, but will think no more.'Then he ordered his gear again, and took the path onward and upwardtoward the Great Mountains; and the track was even fainter thanbefore for a while, so that he had to seek his way diligently.CHAPTER V.  FACE-OF-GOD FALLS IN WITH MENFOLK ON THE MOUNTAINNow he plodded on steadily, and for a long time the forest changedbut little, and of wild things he saw only a few of those that lovethe closest covert.  The ground still went up and up, though atwhiles were hollows, and steeper bents out of them again, and thehalf-blind path or slot still led past the close thickets and fallentrees, and he made way without let or hindrance.  At last once morethe wood began to thin, and the trees themselves to be smaller andgnarled and ill-grown:  therewithal the day was waning, and the skywas quite clear again as the afternoon grew into a fair autumnevening.Now the trees failed altogether, and the slope grown steeper wascovered with heather and ling; and looking up, he saw before himquite near by seeming in the clear even (though indeed they were yetfar away) the snowy peaks flushed with the sinking sun against thefrosty dark-grey eastern sky; and below them the dark rock-mountains,and below these again, and nigh to him indeed, the fells covered withpine-woods and looking like a wall to the heaths he trod.He stayed a little while and turned his head to look at the waywhereby he had come; but that way a swell of the oak-forest hideverything but the wood itself, making a wall behind him as the pine-wood made a wall before.  There came across him then a sharp memoryof the boding words which Stone-face had spoken last night, and hefelt as if he were now indeed within the trap.  But presently helaughed and said:  'I am a fool:  this comes of being alone in thedark wood and the dismal waste, after the merry faces of the Dale hadswept away my foolish musings of yesterday and the day before.  Lo!here I stand, a man of the Face, sword and axe by my side; if deathcome, it can but come once; and if I fear not death, what shall makeme afraid?  The Gods hate me not, and will not hurt me; and they arenot ugly, but beauteous.'Therewith he strode on again, and soon came to a place where theground sank into a shallow valley and the ling gave place to grassfor a while, and there were tall old pines scattered about, andbetwixt them grey rocks; this he passed through, climbing a steepbent out of it, and the pines were all about him now, though growingwide apart, till at last he came to where they thickened into a wood,not very close, wherethrough he went merrily, singing to himself andswinging his spear.  He was soon through this wood, and came on to awide well-grassed wood-lawn, hedged by the wood aforesaid on threesides, but sloping up slowly toward the black wall of the thickerpine-wood on the fourth side, and about half a furlong overthwart andendlong.  The sun had set while he was in the last wood, but it wasstill broad daylight on the wood-lawn, and as he stood there he wasware of a house under the pine-wood on the other side, built long andlow, much like the houses of the Woodland-Carles, but rougherfashioned and of unhewn trees.  He gazed on it, and said aloud tohimself as his wont was:'Marvellous! here is a dwelling of man, scarce a day's journey fromBurgstead; yet have I never heard tell of it:  may happen some of theWoodland-Carles have built it, and are on some errand of huntingpeltries up in the mountains, or maybe are seeking copper and tinamong the rocks.  Well, at least let us go see what manner of mendwell there, and if they are minded for a guest to-night; for fainwere I of a bed beneath a roof, and of a board with strong meat anddrink on it.'Therewith he set forward, not heeding much that the wood he hadpassed through was hard on his left hand; but he had gone but twentypaces when he saw a red thing at the edge of the wood, and then aglitter, and a spear came whistling forth, and smote his own spear sohard close to the steel that it flew out of his hand; then came agreat shout, and a man clad in a scarlet kirtle ran forth on him.Face-of-god had his axe in his hand in a twinkling, and ran at onceto meet his foe; but the man had the hill on his side as he rushed onwith a short-sword in his hand.  Axe and sword clashed together for amoment of time, and then both the men rolled over on the grasstogether, and Face-of-god as he fell deemed that he heard the shrillcry of a woman.  Now Face-of-god found that he was the nethermost,for if he was strong, yet was his foe stronger; the axe had flown outof his hand also, while the strange man still kept a hold of hisshort-sword; and presently, though he still struggled all he could,he saw the man draw back his hand to smite with the said sword; andat that nick of time the foeman's knee was on his breast, his lefthand was doubled back behind him, and his right wrist was grippedhard in the stranger's left hand.  Even therewith his ears, sharpenedby the coming death, heard the sound of footsteps and flutteringraiment drawing near; something dark came between him and the sky;there was the sound of a great stroke, and the big man loosened hisgrip and fell off him to one side.Face-of-god leapt up and ran to his axe and got hold of it; butturning round found himself face to face with a tall woman holding inher hand a stout staff like the limb of a tree.  She was calm andsmiling, though forsooth it was she who had stricken the stroke andstayed the sword from his throat.  His hand and axe dropped down tohis side when he saw what it was that faced him, and that the womanwas young and fair; so he spake to her and said:'What aileth, maiden? is this man thy foe? doth he oppress thee?shall I slay him?'She laughed and said:  'Thou art open-handed in thy proffers:  hemight have asked the like concerning thee but a minute ago.''Yea, yea,' said Gold-mane, laughing also, 'but he asked it not ofthee.''That is sooth,' she said, 'but since thou hast asked me, I will tellthee that if thou slay him it will be my harm as well as his; and inmy country a man that taketh a gift is not wont to break the giver'shead with it straightway.  The man is my brother, O stranger, andpresently, if thou wilt, thou mayst be eating at the same board withhim.  Or if thou wilt, thou mayst go thy ways unhurt into the wood.But I had liefer of the twain that thou wert in our house to-night;for thou hast a wrong against us.'Her voice was sweet and clear, and she spake the last words kindly,and drew somewhat nigher to Gold-mane.  Therewithal the smitten mansat up, and put his hand to his head, and quoth he:'Angry is my sister! good it is to wear the helm abroad when sheshaketh the nut-trees.'' Nay,' said she, 'it is thy luck that thou wert bare-headed, elsehad I been forced to smite thee on the face.  Thou churl, since whenhath it been our wont to thrust knives into a guest, who is come ofgreat kin, a man of gentle heart and fair face?  Come hither andhandsel him self-doom for thy fool's onset!'The man rose to his feet and said:  'Well, sister, least said,soonest mended.  A clout on the head is worse than a woman's chiding;but since ye have given me one, ye may forbear the other.'Therewith he drew near to them.  He was a very big-made man, moststalwarth, with dark red hair and a thin pointed beard; his nose wasstraight and fine, his eyes grey and well-opened, but somewhat fiercewithal.  Yet was he in nowise evil-looking; he seemed some thirtysummers old.  He was clad in a short scarlet kirtle, a goodlygarment, with a hood of like web pulled off his head on to hisshoulders:  he bore a great gold ring on his left arm, and a collarof gold came down on to his breast from under his hood.As for the woman, she was clad in a long white linen smock, and overit a short gown of dark blue woollen, and she had skin shoes on herfeet.Now the man came up to Face-of-god, and took his hand and said:  'Ideemed thee a foe, and I may not have over-many foes alive:  but itseems that thou art to be a friend, and that is well and better; soherewith I handsel thee self-doom in the matter of the onslaught.'Then Face-of-god laughed and said:  'The doom is soon given forth;against the tumble on the grass I set the clout on the head; there isnought left over to pay to any man's son.'Said the scarlet-clad man:  'Belike by thine eyes thou art a trueman, and wilt not bewray me.  Now is there no foeman here, but rathermaybe a friend both now and in time to come.'  Therewith he cast hisarms about Face-of-god and kissed him.  But Face-of-god turned aboutto the woman and said:  'Is the peace wholly made?'She shook her head and said soberly:  'Nay, thou art too fair for awoman to kiss.'He flushed red, as his wont was when a woman praised him; yet was hisheart full of pleasure and well-liking.  But she laid her hand on hisshoulder and said:  'Now is it for thee to choose betwixt the wild-wood and the hall, and whether thou wilt be a guest or a wayfarerthis night.'As she touched him there took hold of him a sweetness of pleasure hehad never felt erst, and he answered:  'I will be thy guest and notthy stranger.''Come then,' she said, and took his hand in hers, so that he scarcefelt the earth under his feet, as they went all three together towardthe house in the gathering dusk, while eastward where the peaks ofthe great mountains dipped was a light that told of the rising of themoon.CHAPTER VI.  OF FACE-OF-GOD AND THOSE MOUNTAIN-DWELLERSA yard or two from the threshold Gold-mane hung back a moment,entangled in some such misgiving as a man is wont to feel when he isjust about to do some new deed, but is not yet deep in the story; hisnew friends noted that, for they smiled each in their own way, andthe woman drew her hand away from his.  Face-of-god held out hisstill as though to take hers again, and therewithal he changedcountenance and said as though he had stayed but to ask thatquestion:'Tell me thy name, tall man; and thou, fair woman, tell me thine; forhow can we talk together else?'The man laughed outright and said:  'The young chieftain thinks thatthis house also should be his!  Nay, young man, I know what is in thythought, be not ashamed that thou art wary; and be assured!  We shallhurt thee no more than thou hast been hurt.  Now as to my name; thename that was born with me is gone:  the name that was given me hathbeen taken from me:  now I belike must give myself a name, and thatshall be Wild-wearer; but it may be that thou thyself shalt one daygive me another, and call me Guest.'His sister gazed at him solemnly as he spoke, and Face-of-godbeholding her the while, deemed that her beauty grew and grew tillshe seemed as aweful as a Goddess; and into his mind it came thatthis over-strong man and over-lovely woman were nought mortal, andthey withal dealing with him as father and mother deal with a waywardchild:  then for a moment his heart failed him, and he longed for thepeace of Burgdale, and even the lonely wood.  But therewith sheturned to him and let her hand come into his again, and looked kindlyon him and said:  'And as for me, call me the Friend; the name isgood and will serve for many things.'He looked down from her face and his eyes lighted on her hand, andwhen he noted even amid the evening dusk how fair and lovely it wasfashioned, and yet as though it were deft in the crafts that thedaughters of menfolk use, his fear departed, and the pleasure of hislonging filled his heart, and he drew her hand to him to kiss it; butshe held it back.  Then he said:  'It is the custom of the Dale toall women.'So she let him kiss her hand, heeding the kiss nothing, and saidsoberly:'Then art thou of Burgdale, and if it were lawful to guess, I wouldsay that thy name is Face-of-god, of the House of the Face.''Even so it is,' said he, 'but in the Dale those that love me domostly call me Gold-mane.''It is well named,' she said, 'and seldom wilt thou be calledotherwise, for thou wilt be well-beloved.  But come in now, Gold-mane, for night is at hand, and here have we meat and lodging such asan hungry and weary man may take; though we be broken people,dwellers in the waste.'Therewith she led him gently over the threshold into the hall, and itseemed to him as if she were the fairest and the noblest of all theQueens of ancient story.When he was in the house he looked and saw that, rough as it waswithout it lacked not fairness within.  The floor was of hard-troddenearth strewn with pine-twigs, and with here and there brown bearskinslaid on it:  there was a standing table near the upper end athwartthe hall, and a days beyond that, but no endlong table.  Gold-manelooked to the shut-beds, and saw that they were large and fair,though there were but a few of them; and at the lower end was a loftfor a sleeping chamber dight very fairly with broidered cloths.  Thehangings on the walls, though they left some places bare which werehung with fresh boughs, were fairer than any he had ever seen, sothat he deemed that they must come from far countries and the City ofCities:  therein were images wrought of warriors and fair women ofold time and their dealings with the Gods and the Giants, andWondrous wights; and he deemed that this was the story of some greatkindred, and that their token and the sign of their banner must needsbe the Wood-wolf, for everywhere was it wrought in these picturedwebs.  Perforce he looked long and earnestly at these fair things,for the hall was not dark yet, because the brands on the hearth wereflaming their last, and when Wild-wearer beheld him so gazing, hestood up and looked too for a moment, and then smote his right handon the hilt of his sword, and turned away and strode up and down thehall as one in angry thought.But the woman, even the Friend, bestirred herself for the service ofthe guest, and brought water for his hands and feet, and when she hadwashed him, bore him the wine of Welcome and drank to him and badehim drink; and he all the while was shamefaced; for it was to him asif one of the Ladies of the Heavenly Burg were doing him service.Then she went away by a door at the lower end of the hall, and Wild-wearer came and sat down by Gold-mane, and fell a-talking with himabout the ways of the Dalesmen, and their garths, and the pasturesand growths thereof; and what temper the carles themselves were of;which were good men, which were ill, which was loved and whichscorned; no otherwise than if he had been the goodman of someneighbouring dale; and Gold-mane told him whatso he knew, for he sawno harm therein.After a while the outer door opened, and there came in a woman ofsome five-and-twenty winters, trimly and strongly built; short-skirted she was and clad as a hunter, with a bow in her hand and aquiver at her back:  she unslung a pouch, which she emptied at Wild-wearer's feet of a leash of hares and two brace of mountain grouse;of Face-of-god she took but little heed.Said Wild-wearer:  'This is good for to-morrow, not for to-day; themeat is well-nigh on the board.'Then Gold-mane smiled, for he called to mind his home-coming ofyesterday.  But the woman said:'The fault is not mine; she told me of the coming guest but threehours agone.''Ay?' said Wild-wearer, 'she looked for a guest then?''Yea, certes,' said the woman, 'else why went I forth this afternoon,as wearied as I was with yesterday?''Well, well,' said Wild-wearer, 'get to thy due work or go play; Imeddle not with meat! and for thee all jests are as bitter earnest.''And with thee, chief,' she said, 'it is no otherwise; surely I ammade on thy model.''Thy tongue is longer, friend,' said he; 'now tarry if thou wilt, andif the supper's service craveth thee not.'She turned away with one keen look at Face-of-god, and departedthrough the door at the lower end of the hall.By this time the hall was dusk, for there were no candles there, andthe hearth-fire was but smouldering.  Wild-wearer sat silent andmusing now, and Face-of-god spake not, for he was deep in wild andhappy dreams.  At last the lower door opened and the fair woman cameinto the hall with a torch in either hand, after whom came thehuntress, now clad in a dark blue kirtle, and an old woman yetstraight and hale; and these twain bore in the victuals and thetable-gear.  Then the three fell to dighting the board, and when itwas all ready, and Gold-mane and Wild-wearer were set down to it, andwith them the fair woman and the huntress, the old woman threw goodstore of fresh brands on the hearth, so that the light shone intoevery corner; and even therewith the outer door opened, and four moremen entered, whereof one was old, but big and stalwarth, the otherthree young:  they were all clad roughly in sheep-brown weed, but hadhelms upon their heads and spears in their hands and great swordsgirt to their sides; and they seemed doughty men and ready forbattle.  One of the young men cast down by the door the carcass of abig-horned mountain sheep, and then they all trooped off to the out-bower by the lower door, and came back presently fairly clad andwithout their weapons.  Wild-wearer nodded to them kindly, and theysat at table paying no more heed to Face-of-god than to cast him anod for salutation.Then said the old woman to them:  'Well, lads, have ye been doing orsleeping?''Sleeping, mother,' said one of the young men, 'as was but due afterlast night was, and to-morrow shall be.'Said the huntress:  'Hold thy peace, Wood-wise, and let thy tonguehelp thy teeth to deal with thy meat; for this is not the talkinghour.''Nay, Bow-may,' said another of the swains, 'since here is a new man,now is the time to talk to him.'Said the huntress:  ''Tis thine hands that talk best, Wood-wont; itis not they that shall bring thee to shame.'Spake the third:  'What have we to do with shame here, far away fromdooms and doomers, and elders, and wardens, and guarded castles?  Ifthe new man listeth to speak, let him speak; or to fight, then lethim; it shall ever be man to man.'Then spake the old woman:  'Son Wood-wicked, hold thy peace, andforget the steel that ever eggeth thee on to draw.'Therewith she set the last matters on the board, while the threeswains sat and eyed Gold-mane somewhat fiercely, now that words hadstirred them, and he had sat there saying nothing, as one who wasbetter than they, and contemned them; but now spake Wild-wearer:'Whoso hungreth let him eat!  Whoso would slumber, let him to bed.But he who would bicker, it must needs be with me.  Here is a man ofthe Dale, who hath sought the wood in peace, and hath found us.  Hishand is ready and his heart is guileless:  if ye fear him, run awayto the wood, and come back when he is gone; but none shall mock himwhile I sit by:  now, lads, be merry and blithe with the guest.'Then the young men greeted Gold-mane, and the old man said:  'Artthou of Burgstead? then wilt thou be of the House of the Face, andthy name will be Face-of-god; for that man is called the fairest ofthe Dale, and there shall be none fairer than thou.'Face-of-god laughed and said:  'There be but few mirrors in Burgdale,and I have no mind to journey west to the cities to see what mannerof man I be:  that were ill husbandry.  But now I have heard thenames of the three swains, tell me thy name, father!'Spake the huntress:  'This is my father's brother, and his name isWood-father; or ye shall call him so:  and I am called Bow-maybecause I shoot well in the bow:  and this old carline is my eme'swife, and now belike my mother, if I need one.  But thou, fair-facedDalesman, little dost thou need a mirror in the Dale so long as womenabide there; for their faces shall be instead of mirrors to tell theewhether thou be fair and lovely.'Thereat they all laughed and fell to their victual, which wasabundant, of wood-venison and mountain-fowl, but of bread was nogreat plenty; wine lacked not, and that of the best; and Gold-manenoted that the cups and the apparel of the horns and mazers were notof gold nor gilded copper, but of silver; and he marvelled thereat,for in the Dale silver was rare.So they ate and drank, and Gold-mane looked ever on the Friend, andspake much with her, and he deemed her friendly indeed, and sheseemed most pleased when he spoke best, and led him on to do so.Wild-wearer was but of few words, and those somewhat harsh; yet washe as a man striving to be courteous and blithe; but of the othersBow-may was the greatest speaker.Wild-wearer called healths to the Sun, and the Moon, and the Hosts ofHeaven; to the Gods of the Earth; to the Woodwights; and to theGuest.  Other healths also he called, the meaning of which was darkto Gold-mane; to wit, the Jaws of the Wolf; the Silver Arm; the RedHand; the Golden Bushel; and the Ragged Sword.  But when he asked theFriend concerning these names what they might signify, she shook herhead and answered not.At last Wild-wearer cried out:  'Now, lads, the night weareth and theguest is weary:  therefore whoso of you hath in him any minstrelsy,now let him make it, for later on it shall be over-late.'Then arose Wood-wont and went to his shut-bed and groped therein, andtook from out of it a fiddle in its case; and he opened the case anddrew from it a very goodly fiddle, and he stood on the floor amidstof the hall and Bow-may his cousin with him; and he laid his bow onthe fiddle and woke up song in it, and when it was well awake shefell a-singing, and he to answering her song, and at the last allthey of the house sang together; and this is the meaning of the wordswhich they sang:She singeth.Now is the rain upon the day,   And every water's wide;Why busk ye then to wear the way,   And whither will ye ride?He singeth.Our kine are on the eyot still,   The eddies lap them round;All dykes the wind-worn waters fill,   And waneth grass and ground.She singeth.O ride ye to the river's brim   In war-weed fair to see?Or winter waters will ye swim   In hauberks to the knee?He singeth.Wild is the day, and dim with rain,   Our sheep are warded ill;The wood-wolves gather for the plain,   Their ravening maws to fill.She singeth.Nay, what is this, and what have ye,   A hunter's band, to bearThe Banner of our Battle-glee   The skulking wolves to scare?He singeth.O women, when we wend our ways   To deal with death and dread,The Banner of our Fathers' Days   Must flap the wind o'erhead.She singeth.Ah, for the maidens that ye leave!   Who now shall save the hay?What grooms shall kiss our lips at eve,   When June hath mastered May?He singeth.The wheat is won, the seed is sown,   Here toileth many a maid,And ere the hay knee-deep hath grown   Your grooms the grass shall wade.They sing all together.Then fair befall the mountain-side   Whereon the play shall be!And fair befall the summer-tide   That whoso lives shall see.Face-of-god thought the song goodly, but to the others it was wellknown.  Then said Wood-father:'O foster-son, thy foster-brother hath sung well for a wood abider;but we are deeming that his singing shall be but as a starling to athrostle matched against thy new-come guest.  Therefore, Dalesman,sing us a song of the Dale, and if ye will, let it be of gardens andpleasant houses of stone, and fair damsels therein, and swains withthem who toil not over-much for a scant livelihood, as do they of thewaste, whose heads may not be seen in the Holy Places.'Said Gold-mane:  'Father, it is ill to set the words of a lonely manafar from his kin against the song that cometh from the heart of anoble house; yet may I not gainsay thee, but will sing to thee what Imay call to mind, and it is called the Song of the Ford.'Therewith he sang in a sweet and clear voice:  and this is themeaning of his words:In hay-tide, through the day new-born,   Across the meads we come;Our hauberks brush the blossomed corn   A furlong short of home.Ere yet the gables we behold   Forth flasheth the red sun,And smites our fallow helms and cold   Though all the fight be done.In this last mend of mowing-grass   Sweet doth the clover smell,Crushed neath our feet red with the pass   Where hell was blent with hell.And now the willowy stream is nigh,   Down wend we to the ford;No shafts across its fishes fly,   Nor flasheth there a sword.But lo! what gleameth on the bank   Across the water wan,As when our blood the mouse-ear drank   And red the river ran?Nay, hasten to the ripple clear,   Look at the grass beyond!Lo ye the dainty band and dear   Of maidens fair and fond!Lo how they needs must take the stream!   The water hides their feet;On fair kind arms the gold doth gleam,   And midst the ford we meet.Up through the garden two and two,   And on the flowers we drip;Their wet feet kiss the morning dew   As lip lies close to lip.Here now we sing; here now we stay:   By these grey walls we tellThe love that lived from out the fray,   The love that fought and fell.When he was done they all said that he had sung well, and that thesong was sweet.  Yet did Wild-wearer smile somewhat; and Bow-may saidoutright:  'Soft is the song, and hath been made by lads andminstrels rather than by warriors.''Nay, kinswoman,' said Wood-father, 'thou art hard to please; theguest is kind, and hath given us that I asked for, and I give him allthanks therefor.'Face-of-god smiled, but he heeded little what they said, for as hesang he had noted that the Friend looked kindly on him; and hethought he saw that once or twice she put out her hand as if to touchhim, but drew it back again each time.  She spake after a little andsaid:'Here now hath been a stream of song running betwixt the Mountain andthe Dale even as doth a river; and this is good to come between ourdreams of what hath been and what shall be.'  Then she turned toGold-mane, and said to him scarce loud enough for all to hear:'Herewith I bid thee good-night, O Dalesman; and this other word Ihave to thee:  heed not what befalleth in the night, but sleep thybest, for nought shall be to thy scathe.  And when thou wakest in themorning, if we are yet here, it is well; but if we are not, thenabide us no long while, but break thy fast on the victual thou wiltfind upon the board, and so depart and go thy ways home.  And yetthou mayst look to it to see us again before thou diest.'Therewith she held out her hand to him, and he took it and kissed it;and she went to her chamber-aloft at the lower end of the hall.  Andwhen she was gone, once more he had a deeming of her that she was ofthe kindred of the Gods.  At her departure him-seemed that the hallgrew dull and small and smoky, and the night seemed long to him anddoubtful the coming of the day.CHAPTER VII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND ON THE MOUNTAINSo now went all men to bed; and Face-to-god's shut-bed was overagainst the outer door and toward the lower end of the hall, and onthe panel about it hung the weapons and shields of men.  Fair wasthat chamber and roomy, and the man was weary despite his eagerness,so that he went to sleep as soon as his head touched the pillow; butwithin a while (he deemed about two hours after midnight) he wasawaked by the clattering of the weapons against the panel, and thesound of men's hands taking them down; and when he was fully awake,he heard withal men going up and down the house as if on errands:but he called to mind what the Friend had said to him, and he did notso much as turn himself toward the hall; for he said:  'Belike thesemen are outlaws and Wolves of the Holy Places, yet by seeming theyare good fellows and nought churlish, nor have I to do with taking upthe feud against them.  I will abide the morning.  Yet meseemeth thatshe drew me hither:  for what cause?'Therewith he fell asleep again, and dreamed no more.  But when heawoke the sun was shining broad upon the hall-floor, and he sat upand listened, but could hear no sound save the moaning of the wind inthe pine-boughs and the chatter of the starlings about the gables ofthe house; and the place seemed so exceeding lonely to him that hewas in a manner feared by that loneliness.Then he arose and clad himself, and went forth into the hall andgazed about him, and at first he deemed indeed that there was no onetherein.  But at last he looked and beheld the upper gable and thereunderneath a most goodly hanging was the glorious shape of a womansitting on a bench covered over with a cloth of gold and silver; andhe looked and looked to see if the woman might stir, and if she werealive, and she turned her head toward him, and lo it was the Friend;and his heart rose to his mouth for wonder and fear and desire.  Fornow he doubted whether the other folk were aught save shows andshadows, and she the Goddess who had fashioned them out of nothingfor his bewilderment, presently to return to nothing.Yet whatever he might fear or doubt, he went up the hall towards hertill he was quite nigh to her, and there he stood silent, wonderingat her beauty and desiring her kindness.Grey-eyed she was like her brother; but her hair the colour of redwheat:  her lips full and red, her chin round, her nose fine andstraight.  Her hands and all her body fashioned exceeding sweetly anddelicately; yet not as if she were an image of which the like mightbe found if the craftsman were but deft enough to make a perfectthing, but in such a way that there was none like to her for thosethat had eyes to behold her as she was; and none could ever be madelike to her, even by such a master-craftsman as could fashion a bodywithout a blemish.She was clad in a white smock, whose hems were broidered with goldwire and precious gems of the Mountains, and over that a gown wovenof gold and silver:  scarce hath the world such another.  On her headwas a fillet of gold and gems, and there were wondrous gold rings onher arms:  her feet lay bare on the dark grey wolf-skin that wasstretched before her.She smiled kindly upon his solemn and troubled face, and her voicesounded strangely familiar to him coming from all that loveliness, asshe said:  'Hail, Face-of-god! here am I left alone, although Ideemed last night that I should be gone with the others.  Therefoream I fain to show myself to thee in fairer array than yesternight;for though we dwell in the wild-wood, from the solace of folk, yetare we not of thralls' blood.  But come now, I bid thee break thyfast and talk with me a little while; and then shalt thou depart inpeace.'Spake Face-of-god, and his voice trembled as he spake:  'What artthou?  Last night I deemed at whiles once and again that thou wert ofthe Gods; and now that I behold thee thus, and it is broad daylight,and of those others is no more to be seen than if they had neverlived, I cannot but deem that it is even so, and that thou comestfrom the City that shall never perish.  Now if thou be a goddess, Ihave nought to pray thee, save to slay me speedily if thou hast amind for my death.  But if thou art a woman--'She broke in:  'Gold-mane, stay thy prayer and hold thy peace forthis time, lest thou repent when repentance availeth not.  And this Isay because I am none of the Gods nor akin to them, save far offthrough the generations, as art thou also, and all men of goodlykindred.  Now I bid thee eat thy meat, since 'tis ill talking betwixta full man and a fasting; and I have dight it myself with mine ownhands; for Bow-may and the Wood-mother went away with the rest threehours before dawn.  Come sit and eat as thou hast a hardy heart; asforsooth thou shouldest do if I were a very goddess.  Take heed,friend, lest I take thee for some damsel of the lower Dale arrayed inEarl's garments.'She laughed therewith, and leaned toward him and put forth her handto him, and he took it and caressed it; and the exceeding beauty ofher body and of the raiment which was as it were a part of her andher loveliness, made her laughter and her friendly words strange tohim, as if one did not belong to the other; as in a dream it mightbe.  Nevertheless he did as she bade him, and sat at the board andate, while she leaned forward on the arm of her chair and spake tohim in friendly wise.  And he wondered as she spake that she knew somuch of him and his:  and he kept saying to himself:  'She drew mehither; wherefore did she so?'But she said:  'Gold-mane, how fareth thy father the Alderman? is heas good a wright as ever?'He told her:  Yea, that ever was his hammer on the iron, the copper,and the gold, and that no wright in the Dale was as deft as he.Said she:  'Would he not have had thee seek to the Cities, to see theways of the outer world?''Yea,' said he.She said:  'Thou wert wise to naysay that offer; thou shalt haveenough to do in the Dale and round about it in twelve months' time.''Art thou foresighted?' said he.'Folk have called me so,' she said, 'but I wot not.  But thy brotherHall-face, how fareth he?''Well;' said he, 'to my deeming he is the Sword of our House, and theWarrior of the Dale, if the days were ready for him.''And Stone-face, that stark ancient,' she said, 'doth he still lovethe Folk of the Dale, and hate all other folks?''Nay,' he said, 'I know not that, but I know that he loveth as, andabove all me and my father.'Again she spake:  'How fareth the Bride, the fair maid to whom thouart affianced?'As she spake, it was to him as if his heart was stricken cold; but heput a force upon himself, and neither reddened nor whitened, norchanged countenance in any way; so he answered:'She was well the eve of yesterday.'  Then he remembered what shewas, and her beauty and valour, and he constrained himself to say:'Each day she groweth fairer; there is no man's son and no daughterof woman that does not love her; yea, the very beasts of field andfold love her.'The Friend looked at him steadily and spake no word, but a red flushmounted to her cheeks and brow and changed her face; and he marvelledthereat; for still he misdoubted that she was a Goddess.  But itpassed away in a moment, and she smiled and said:'Guest, thou seemest to wonder that I know concerning thee and theDale and thy kindred.  But now shalt thou wot that I have been in theDale once and again, and my brother oftener still; and that I haveseen thee before yesterday.''That is marvellous,' quoth he, 'for sure am I that I have not seenthee.''Yet thou hast seen me,' she said; 'yet not altogether as I am now;'and therewith she smiled on him friendly.'How is this?' said he; 'art thou a skin-changer?''Yea, in a fashion,' she said.  'Hearken! dost thou perchanceremember a day of last summer when there was a market holden inBurgstead; and there stood in the way over against the House of theFace a tall old carle who was trucking deer-skins for diverse gear;and with him was a queen, tall and dark-skinned, somewhat well-liking, her hair bound up in a white coif so that none of it could beseen; by the token that she had a large stone of mountain blue set insilver stuck in the said coif?'As she spoke she set her hand to her bosom and drew something fromit, and held forth her hand to Gold-mane, and lo amidst the palm thegreat blue stone set in silver.'Wondrous as a dream is this,' said Face-of-god, 'for these twain Iremember well, and what followed.'She said:  'I will tell thee that.  There came a man of the Shepherd-Folk, drunk or foolish, or both, who began to chaffer with the bigcarle; but ever on the queen were his eyes set, and presently he putforth his hand to her to clip her, whereon the big carle hove up hisfist and smote him, so that he fell to earth noseling.  Then ran thefolk together to hale off the stranger and help the shepherd, and itwas like that the stranger should be mishandled.  Then there thrustthrough the press a young man with yellow hair and grey eyes, whocried out, "Fellows, let be!  The stranger had the right of it; thisis no matter to make a quarrel or a court case of.  Let the market goon!  This man and maid are true folk."  So when the folk heard theyoung man and his bidding, they forebore and let the carle and thequeen be, and the shepherd went his ways little hurt.  Now then, whowas this young man?'Quoth Gold-mane:  'It was even I, and meseemeth it was no great deedto do.''Yea,' she said, 'and the big carle was my brother, and the tallqueen, it was myself.''How then,' said he, 'for she was as dark-skinned as a dwarf, andthou so bright and fair?'She said:  'Well, if the woods are good for nothing else, yet arethey good for the growing of herbs, and I know the craft of simpling;and with one of these herbs had I stained my skin and my brother'salso.  And it showed the darker beneath the white coif.''Yea,' said he, 'but why must ye needs fare in feigned shapes?  Yewould have been welcome guests in the Dale howsoever ye had come.''I may not tell thee hereof as now,' said she.Said Gold-mane:  'Yet thou mayst belike tell me wherefore was thatthy brother desired to slay me yesterday, if he knew me, who I was.''Gold-mane,' she said, 'thou art not slain, so little story need bemade of that:  for the rest, belike he knew thee not at that moment.So it falls with us, that we look to see foes rather than friends inthe wild-woods.  Many uncouth things are therein.  Moreover, I musttell thee of my brother that whiles he is as the stalled bull latelet loose, and nothing is good to him save battle and onset; and thenis he blind and knows not friend from foe.'  Said Face-of-god:  'Thouhast asked of me and mine; wilt thou not tell me of thee and thine?''Nay,' she said, 'not as now; thou must betake thee to the way.Whither wert thou wending when thou happenedst upon us?'He said:  'I know not; I was seeking something, but I knew not what--meseemeth that now I have found it.''Art thou for the great mountains seeking gems?' she said.  'Yet gonot thither to-day:  for who knoweth what thou shalt meet there thatshall be thy foe?'He said:  'Nay, nay; I have nought to do but to abide here as long asI may, looking upon thee and hearkening to thy voice.'Her eyes were upon his, but yet she did not seem to see him, and fora while she answered not; and still he wondered that mere wordsshould come from so fair a thing; for whether she moved foot, orhand, or knee, or turned this way or that, each time she stirred itwas a caress to his very heart.He spake again:  'May I not abide here a while?  What scathe may bein that?''It is not so,' she said; 'thou must depart, and that straightway:lo, there lieth thy spear which the Wood-mother hath brought in fromthe waste.  Take thy gear to thee and wend thy ways.  Have patience!I will lead thee to the place where we first met and there give theefarewell.'Therewith she arose and he also perforce, and when they came to thedoorway she stepped across the threshold and then turned back andgave him her hand and so led him forth, the sun flashing back fromher golden raiment.  Together they went over the short grey grass ofthat hillside till they came to the place where he had arisen fromthat wrestle with her brother.  There she stayed him and said:'This is the place; here must we part.'But his heart failed him and he faltered in his speech as he said:'When shall I see thee again?  Wilt thou slay me if I seek to theehither once more?''Hearken,' she said, 'autumn is now a-dying into winter:  let winterand its snows go past:  nor seek to me hither; for me thou should'stnot find, but thy death thou mightest well fall in with; and I wouldnot that thou shouldest die.  When winter is gone, and spring is onthe land, if thou hast not forgotten us thou shalt meet us again.Yet shalt thou go further than this Woodland Hall.  In Shadowy Valeshalt thou seek to me then, and there will I talk with thee.''And where,' said he, 'is Shadowy Vale? for thereof have I neverheard tell.'She said:  'The token when it cometh to thee shall show thee thereofand the way thither.  Art thou a babbler, Gold-mane?'He said:  'I have won no prize for babbling hitherto.'She said:  'If thou listest to babble concerning what hath befallenthee on the Mountain, so do, and repent it once only, that is, thylife long.''Why should I say any word thereof?' said he.  'Dost thou not knowthe sweetness of such a tale untold?'He spake as one who is somewhat wrathful, and she answered humbly andkindly:'Well is that.  Bide thou the token that shall lead thee to ShadowyVale.  Farewell now.'She drew her hand from his, and turned and went her ways swiftly tothe house:  he could not choose but gaze on her as she wentglittering-bright and fair in that grey place of the mountains, tillthe dark doorway swallowed up her beauty.  Then he turned away andtook the path through the pine-woods, muttering to himself as hewent:'What thing have I done now that hitherto I had not done?  Whatmanner of man am I to-day other than the man I was yesterday?'CHAPTER VIII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME AGAIN TO BURGSTEADFace-of-God went back through the wood by the way he had come, payinglittle heed to the things about him.  For whatever he thought ofstrayed not one whit from the image of the Fair Woman of theMountain-side.He went through the wood swiftlier than yesterday, and made no stayfor noon or aught else, nor did he linger on the road when he wascome into the Dale, either to speak to any or to note what they did.So he came to the House of the Face about dusk, and found no manwithin the hall either carle or queen.  So he cried out on the folk,and there came in a damsel of the house, whom he greeted kindly andshe him again.  He bade her bring the washing-water, and she did soand washed his feet and his hands.  She was a fair maid enough, aswere most in the Dale, but he heeded her little; and when she wasdone he kissed not her cheek for her pains, as his wont was, but lether go her ways unthanked.  But he went to his shut-bed and openedhis chest, and drew fair raiment from it, and did off his wood-gear,and did on him a goodly scarlet kirtle fairly broidered, and a collarwith gems of price therein, and other braveries.  And when he was soattired he came out into the hall, and there was old Stone-facestanding by the hearth, which was blazing brightly with fresh brands,so that things were clear to see.Stone-face noted Gold-mane's gay raiment, for he was not wont to wearsuch attire, save on the feasts and high days when he behoved to.  Sothe old man smiled and said:'Welcome back from the Wood!  But what is it?  Hast thou been weddedthere, or who hath made thee Earl and King?'Said Face-of-god:  'Foster-father, sooth it is that I have been tothe wood, but there have I seen nought of manfolk worse than myself.Now as to my raiment, needs must I keep it from the moth.  And I amweary withal, and this kirtle is light and easy to me.  Moreover, Ilook to see the Bride here again, and I would pleasure her with thesight of gay raiment upon me.''Nay,' said Stone-face, 'hast thou not seen some woman in the woodarrayed like the image of a God? and hath she not bidden thee thus toworship her to-night?  For I know that such wights be in the wood,and that such is their wont.'Said Gold-mane:  'I worship nought save the Gods and the Fathers.Nor saw I in the wood any such as thou sayest.'Therewith Stone-face shook his head; but after a while he said:'Art thou for the wood to-morrow?''Nay,' said Gold-mane angrily, knitting his brows.'The morrow of to-morrow,' said Stone-face, 'is the day when we lookto see the Westland merchants:  after all, wilt thou not go hencewith them when they wend their ways back before the first snowsfall?''Nay,' said he, 'I have no mind to it, fosterer; cease egging me onhereto.'Then Stone-face shook his head again, and looked on him long, andmuttered:  'To the wood wilt thou go to-morrow or next day; or someday when doomed is thine undoing.'Therewith entered the service and torches, and presently after camethe Alderman with Hall-face; and Iron-face greeted his son and saidto him:  'Thou hast not hit the time to do on thy gay raiment, forthe Bride will not be here to-night; she bideth still at the Feast atthe Apple-tree House:  or wilt thou be there, son?''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'I am over-weary.  And as for my raiment, itis well; it is for thine honour and the honour of the name.'So to table they went, and Iron-face asked his son of his ways again,and whether he was quite fixed in his mind not to go down to thePlain and the Cities:  'For,' said he, 'the morrow of to-morrow shallthe merchants be here, and this were great news for them if the sonof the Alderman should be their faring-fellow back.'But Face-of-god answered without any haste or heat:  'Nay, father, itmay not be:  fear not, thou shalt see that I have a good will to workand live in the Dale.'And in good sooth, though he was a young man and loved mirth and theways of his own will, he was a stalwarth workman, and few could mow amatch with him in the hay-month and win it; or fell trees ascertainly and swiftly, or drive as straight and clean a furrowthrough the stiff land of the lower Dale; and in other matters alsowas he deft and sturdy.CHAPTER IX.  THOSE BRETHREN FARE TO THE YEWWOOD WITH THE BRIDENext morning Face-of-god dight himself for work, and took his axe;for his brother Hall-face had bidden him go down with him to the Yew-wood and cut timber there, since he of all men knew where to gostraight to the sticks that would quarter best for bow-staves;whereas the Alderman had the right of hewing in that wood.  So theywent forth, those brethren, from the House of the Face, but when theywere gotten to the gate, who should be there but the Bride awaitingthem, and she with an ass duly saddled for bearing the yew-sticks.Because Hall-face had told her that he and belike Gold-mane weregoing to hew in the wood, and she thought it good to be of thecompany, as oft had befallen erst.  When they met she greeted Face-of-god and kissed him as her wont was; and he looked upon her and sawhow fair she was, and how kind and friendly were her eyes that beheldhim, and how her whole face was eager for him as their lips parted.Then his heart failed him, when he knew that he no longer desired heras she did him, and he said within himself:'Would that she had been of our nighest kindred!  Would that I hadhad a sister and that this were she!'So the three went along the highway down the Dale, and Hall-face andthe Bride talked merrily together and laughed, for she was happy,since she knew that Gold-mane had been to the wood and was back safeand much as he had been before.  So indeed it seemed of him; forthough at first he was moody and of few words, yet presently hecursed himself for a mar-sport, and so fell into the talk, andenforced himself to be merry; and soon he was so indeed; for hethought:  'She drew me thither:  she hath a deed for me to do.  Ishall do the deed and have my reward.  Soon will the spring-tide behere, and I shall be a young man yet when it comes.'So came they to the place where he had met the three maidensyesterday; there they also turned from the highway; and as they wentdown the bent, Gold-mane could not but turn his eyes on the beauty ofthe Bride and the lovely ways of her body:  but presently heremembered all that had betid, and turned away again as one who isnoting what it behoves him not to note.  And he said to himself:'Where art thou, Gold-mane?  Whose art thou?  Yea, even if that hadbeen but a dream that I have dreamed, yet would that this fair womanwere my sister!'So came they to the Yew-wood, and the brethren fell to work, and theBride with them, for she was deft with the axe and strong withal.But at midday they rested on the green slope without the Yew-wood;and they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples, and drank redwine of the Dale.  And while they were resting after their meat, theBride sang to them, and her song was a lay of time past; and here yehave somewhat of it:'Tis over the hill and over the dale   Men ride from the city fast and far,If they may have a soothfast tale,   True tidings of the host of war.And first they hap on men-at-arms,   All clad in steel from head to foot:Now tell true tale of the new-come harms,   And the gathered hosts of the mountain-root.Fair sirs, from murder-carles we flee,   Whose fashion is as the mountain-trolls';No man can tell how many they be,   And the voice of their host as the thunder rolls.They were weary men at the ending of day,   But they spurred nor stayed for longer word.Now ye, O merchants, whither away?   What do ye there with the helm and the sword?O we must fight for life and gear,   For our beasts are spent and our wains are stayed,And the host of the Mountain-men draws near,   That maketh all the world afraid.They left the chapmen on the hill,   And through the eve and through the nightThey rode to have true tidings still,   And were there on the way when the dawn was bright.O damsels fair, what do ye then   To loiter thus upon the way,And have no fear of the Mountain-men,   The host of the carles that strip and slay?O riders weary with the road,   Come eat and drink on the grass hereby!And lay you down in a fair abode   Till the midday sun is broad and high;Then unto you shall we come aback,   And lead you forth to the Mountain-men,To note their plenty and their lack,   And have true tidings there and then.'Tis over the hill and over the dale   They ride from the mountain fast and far;And now have they learned a soothfast tale,   True tidings of the host of war.It was summer-tide and the Month of Hay,   And men and maids must fare afield;But we saw the place were the bow-staves lay,   And the hall was hung with spear and shield.When the moon was high we drank in the hall,   And they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe,And they said:  Come back when the chestnuts fall,   And the wine-carts wend across the hythe.Come oft and o'er again, they said;   Wander your ways; but we abideFor all the world in the little stead;   For wise are we, though the world be wide.Yea, come in arms if ye will, they said;   And despite your host shall we abideFor life or death in the little stead;   For wise are we, though the world be wide.So she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreadingwide before her, and a robin came nigh from out of a thorn-bush andsung his song also, the sweet herald of coming winter; and thelapwings wheeled about, black and white, above the meadow by theriver, sending forth their wheedling pipe as they hung above the softturf.She felt the brothers near her, and knew their friendliness from ofold, and she was happy; nor had she looked closer at Gold-mane wouldshe have noted any change in him belike; for the meat and the goodwine, and the fair sunny time, and the Bride's sweet voice, and theancient song softened his heart while it fed the desire therein.So in a while they arose from their rest and did what was left themof their work, and so went back to Burgstead through the fairafternoon; by seeming all three in all content.  But yet Gold-mane,as from time to time he looked upon the Bride, kept saying tohimself:  'O if she had been but my sister! sweet had the kinshipbeen!'CHAPTER X.  NEW TIDINGS IN THE DALEIt was three days thereafter that Gold-mane, leading an ass, wentalong the highway to fetch home certain fleeces which were needed forthe house from a stead a little west of Wildlake; but he had gonescant half a mile ere he fell in with a throng of folk going toBurgstead.  They were of the Shepherds; they had weapons with them,and some were clad in coats of fence.  They went along making a greatnoise, for they were all talking each to each at the same time, andseemed very hot and eager about some matter.  When they saw Gold-maneanigh, they stopped, and the throng opened as if to let him intotheir midmost; so he mingled with them, and they stood in a ringabout him and an old man more ill-favoured than it was the wont ofthe Dalesmen to be.For he was long, stooping, gaunt and spindle-shanked, his hands bigand crippled with gout:  his cheeks were red after an old man'sfashion, covered with a crimson network like a pippin; his lips thinand not well hiding his few teeth; his nose long like a snipe's neb.In short, a shame and a laughing-stock to the Folk, and a man whomthe kindreds had in small esteem, and that for good reasons.Face-of-god knew him at once for a notable close-fist and starve-allfool of the Shepherds; and his name was now become Penny-thumb theLean, whatever it might once have been.So Face-of-god greeted all men, and they him again; and he said:'What aileth you, neighbours?  Your weapons, are bare, but I see notthat they be bloody.  What is it, goodman Penny-thumb?'Penny-thumb did but groan for all answer; but a stout carle who stoodby with a broad grin on his face answered and said:'Face-of-god, evil tidings be abroad; the strong-thieves of the woodare astir; and some deem that the wood-wights be helping them.''Yea, and what is the deed they have done?' said Gold-mane.Said the carle:  'Thou knowest Penny-thumb's abode?''Yea surely,' said Face-of-god; 'fair are the water-meadows about it;great gain of cheese can be gotten thence.''Hast thou been within the house?' said the carle.'Nay,' said Gold-mane.Then spake Penny-thumb:  'Within is scant gear:  we gather for othersto scatter; we make meat for others' mouths.'The carle laughed:  'Sooth is that,' said he, 'that there is littlegear therein now; for the strong-thieves have voided both hall andbower and byre.''And when was that?' said Face-of-god.'The night before last night,' said the carle, 'the door was smittenon, and when none answered it was broken down.''Yea,' quoth Penny-thumb, 'a host entered, and they in arms.''No host was within,' said the carle, 'nought but Penny-thumb and hissister and his sister's son, and three carles that work for him; andone of them, Rusty to wit, was the worst man of the hill-country.These then the host whereof the goodman telleth bound, but withoutdoing them any scathe; and they ransacked the house, and took awaymuch gear; yet left some.''Thou liest,' said Penny-thumb; 'they took little and left none.'Thereat all men laughed, for this seemed to them good game, andanother man said:  'Well, neighbour Penny-thumb, if it was so little,thou hast done unneighbourly in giving us such a heap of troubleabout it.'And they laughed again, but the first carle said:  'True it is,goodman, that thou wert exceeding eager to raise the hue and cryafter that little when we happed upon thee and thy housemates boundin your chairs yesterday morning.  Well, Alderman's son, short is thetale to tell:  we could not fail to follow the gear, and the slot ledus into the wood, and ill is the going there for us shepherds, whoare used to the bare downs, save Rusty, who was a good woodsman andlifted the slot for us; so he outwent us all, and ran out of sight ofus, so presently we came upon him dead-slain, with the manslayer'sspear in his breast.  What then could we do but turn back again, fornow was the wood blind now Rusty was dead, and we knew not whither tofollow the fray; and the man himself was but little loss:  so back weturned, and told goodman Penny-thumb of all this, for we had left himalone in his hall lamenting his gear; so we bided to-day's morn, andhave come out now, with our neighbour and the spear, and the deadcorpse of Rusty.  Stand aside, neighbours, and let the Alderman's sonsee it.'They did so, and there was the corpse of a thin-faced tall wiry man,somewhat foxy of aspect, lying on a hand-bier covered with blackcloth.'Yea, Face-of-god,' said the carle, 'he is not good to see now he isdead, yet alive was he worser:  but, look you, though the man was nogood man, yet was he of our people, and the feud is with us; so wewould see the Alderman, and do him to wit of the tidings, that he maycall the neighbours together to seek a blood-wite for Rusty andatonement for the ransacking.  Or what sayest thou?''Have ye the spear that ye found in Rusty?' quoth Gold-mane.'Yea verily,' said the carle.  'Hither with it, neighbours; give itto the Alderman's son.'So the spear came into his hand, and he looked at it and said:'This is no spear of the smiths' work of the Dale, as my father willtell you.  We take but little keep of the forging of spearheads here,so that they be well-tempered and made so as to ride well on theshaft; but this head, daintily is it wrought, the blood-trench asclean and trim as though it were an Earl's sword.  See you withalthis inlaying of runes on the steel?  It is done with no tin orcopper, but with very silver; and these bands about the shaft be ofsilver also.  It is a fair weapon, and the owner hath a loss of itgreater than his gain in the slaying of Rusty; and he will have leftit in the wound so that he might be known hereafter, and that hemight be said not to have murdered Rusty but to have slain him.  Orhow think ye?'They all said that this seemed like to be; but that if the man whohad slain Rusty were one of the ransackers they might have a blood-wite of him, if they could find him.  Gold-mane said that so it was,and therewithal he gave the shepherds good-speed and went on his way.But they came to Burgstead and found the Alderman, and in due timewas a Court held, and a finding uttered, and outlawry given forth forthe manslaying and the ransacking against certain men unknown.  Asfor the spear, it was laid up in the House of the Face.But Face-of-god pondered these matters in his mind, for suchransackings there had been none of in late years; and he said tohimself that his friends of the Mountain must have other folk, ofwhich the Dalesmen knew nought, whose gear they could lift, or howcould they live in that place.  And he marvelled that they shouldrisk drawing the Dalesmen's wrath upon them; whereas they of the Dalewere strong men not easily daunted, albeit peaceable enough if notstirred to wrath.  For in good sooth he had no doubt concerning thatspear, whose it was and whence it came:  for that very weapon hadbeen leaning against the panel of his shut-bed the night he slept onthe Mountain, and all the other spears that he saw there were more orless of the same fashion, and adorned with silver.Albeit all that he knew, and all that he thought of, he kept in hisown heart and said nothing of it.So wore the autumn into early winter; and the Westland merchants camein due time, and departed without Face-of-god, though his father madehim that offer one last time.  He went to and fro about his work inthe Dale, and seemed to most men's eyes nought changed from what hehad been.  But the Bride noted that he saw her less often than hiswont was, and abode with her a lesser space when he met her; and shecould not think what this might mean; nor had she heart to ask himthereof, though she was sorry and grieved, but rather withdrew hercompany from him somewhat; and when she perceived that he noted itnot, and made no question of it, then was she the sorrier.But the first winter-snow came on with a great storm of wind from thenorth-east, so that no man stirred abroad who was not compelledthereto, and those who went abroad risked life and limb thereby.Next morning all was calm again, and the snow was deep, but it didnot endure long, for the wind shifted to the southwest and the thawcame, and three days after, when folk could fare easily again up anddown the Dale, came tidings to Burgstead and the Alderman from theLower Dale, how a house called Greentofts had been ransacked there,and none knew by whom.  Now the goodman of Greentofts was littleloved of the neighbours:  he was grasping and overbearing, and hadoften cowed others out of their due:  he was very cross-grained, bothat home and abroad:  his wife had fled from his hand, neither did hissons find it good to abide with him:  therewithal he was wealthy ofgoods, a strong man and a deft man-at-arms.  When his sons and hiswife departed from him, and none other of the Dalesmen cared to abidewith him, he went down into the Plain, and got thence men to be withhim for hire, men who were not well seen to in their own land.  Theseto the number of twelve abode with him, and did his bidding whenso itpleased them.  Two more had he had who had been slain by good men ofthe Dale for their masterful ways; and no blood-wite had been paidfor them, because of their ill-doings, though they had not been madeoutlaws.  This man of Greentofts was called Harts-bane after hisfather, who was a great hunter.Now the full tidings of the ransacking were these:  The storm begantwo hours before sunset, and an hour thereafter, when it was quitedark, for without none could see because the wind was at its heightand the drift of the snow was hard and full, the hall-door flew open;and at first men thought it had been the wind, until they saw in thedimness (for all lights but the fire on the hearth had been quenched)certain things tumbling in which at first they deemed were wolves;but when they took swords and staves against them, lo they were metby swords and axes, and they saw that the seeming wolves were menwith wolf-skins drawn over them.  So the new-comers cowed them thatthey threw down their weapons, and were bound in their places; butwhen they were bound, and had had time to note who the ransackerswere, they saw that there were but six of them all told, who hadcowed and bound Harts-bane and his twelve masterful men; and thisthey deemed a great shaming to them, as might well be.So then the stead was ransacked, and those wolves took away what theywould, and went their ways through the fierce storm, and none couldtell whether they had lived or died in it; but at least neither themen nor their prey were seen again; nor did they leave any slot, fornext morning the snow lay deep over everything.No doubt had Gold-mane but that these ransackers were his friends ofthe Mountain; but he held his peace, abiding till the winter shouldbe over.CHAPTER XI.  MEN MAKE OATH AT BURGSTEAD ON THE HOLY BOARA week after the ransacking at Greentofts the snow and the wintercame on in earnest, and all the Dale lay in snow, and men went onskids when they fared up and down the Dale or on the Mountain.All was now tidingless till Yule over, and in Burgstead was therefeasting and joyance enough; and especially at the House of the Facewas high-tide holden, and the Alderman and his sons and Stone-faceand all the kindred and all their men sat in glorious attire withinthe hall; and many others were there of the best of the kindreds ofBurgstead who had been bidden.Face-of-god sat between his father and Stone-face; and he looked upand down the tables and the hall and saw not the Bride, and his heartmisgave him because she was not there, and he wondered what hadbefallen and if she were sick of sorrow.But Iron-face beheld him how he gazed about, and he laughed; for hewas exceeding merry that night and fared as a young man.  Then hesaid to his son:  'Whom seekest thou, son? is there someone lacking?'Face-of-god reddened as one who lies unused to it, and said:'Yea, kinsman, so it is that I was seeking the Bride my kinswoman.''Nay,' said Iron-face, 'call her not kinswoman:  therein is ill-luck,lest it seem that thou art to wed one too nigh thine own blood.  Callher the Bride only:  to thee and to me the name is good.  Well, son,desirest thou sorely to see her?''Yea, yea, surely,' said Face-of-god; but his eyes went all about thehall still, as though his mind strayed from the place and that homeof his.Said Iron-face:  'Have patience, son, thou shalt see her anon, andthat in such guise as shall please thee.'Therewithal came the maidens with the ewers of wine, and they filledall horns and beakers, and then stood by the endlong tables on eitherside laughing and talking with the carles and the older women; andthe hall was a fair sight to see, for the many candles burned brightand the fire on the hearth flared up, and those maids were clad infair raiment, and there was none of them but was comely, and somewere fair, and some very fair:  the walls also were hung with goodlypictured cloths, and the image of the God of the Face looked downsmiling terribly from the gable-end above the high-seat.Thus as they sat they heard the sound of a horn winded close outsidethe hall door, and the door was smitten on.  Then rose Iron-facesmiling merrily, and cried out:'Enter ye, whether ye be friends or foes:  for if ye be foemen, yetshall ye keep the holy peace of Yule, unless ye be the foes of allkindreds and nations, and then shall we slay you.'Thereat some who knew what was toward laughed; but Gold-mane, who hadbeen away from Burgstead some days past, marvelled and knit hisbrows, and let his right hand fall on his sword-hilt.  For this folk,who were of merry ways, were wont to deal diversely with the Yule-tide customs in the manner of shows; and he knew not that this wasone of them.Now was the Outer door thrown open, and there entered seven men,whereof two were all-armed in bright war-gear, and two bore slug-horns, and two bore up somewhat on a dish covered over with a pieceof rich cloth, and the seventh stood before them all wrapped up in adark fur mantle.Thus they stood a moment; and when he saw their number, back to Gold-mane's heart came the thought of those folk on the Mountain:  forindeed he was somewhat out of himself for doubt and longing, elsewould he have deemed that all this was but a Yule-tide play.Now the men with the slug-horns set them to their mouths and blew along blast; while the first of the new-comers set hand to the claspsof the fur cloak and let it fall to the ground, and lo! a womanexceeding beauteous, clad in glistering raiment of gold and fine web;her hair wreathed with bay, and in her hand a naked sword withgoodly-wrought golden hilt and polished blue-gleaming blade.Face-of-god started up in his sear, and stared like a man new-wakenedfrom a strange dream:  because for one moment he deemed verily thatit was the Woman of the Mountain arrayed as he had last seen her, andhe cried aloud 'The Friend, the Friend!'His father brake out into loud laughter thereat, and clapped his sonon the shoulder and said:  'Yea, yea, lad, thou mayst well say theFriend; for this is thine old playmate whom thou hast been lookinground the hall for, arrayed this eve in such fashion as is meet forher goodliness and her worthiness.  Yea, this is the Friend indeed!'Then waxed Face-of-god as red as blood for shame, and he sat him downin his place again:  for now he wotted what was toward, and saw thatthis fair woman was the Bride.But Stone-face from the other side looked keenly on him.Then blew the horns again, and the Bride stepped daintily up thehall, and the sweet odour of her raiment went from her about thefire-warmed dwelling, and her beauty moved all hearts with love.  Sostood she at the high-table; and those two who bore the burden set itdown thereon and drew off the covering, and lo! there was the HolyBoar of Yule on which men were wont to make oath of deeds that theywould do in the coming year, according to the custom of theirforefathers.  Then the Bride laid the goodly sword beside the dish,and then went round the table and sat down betwixt Face-of-god andStone-face, and turned kindly to Gold-mane, and was glad; for now washis fair face as its wont was to be.  He in turn smiled upon her, forshe was fair and kind and his fellow for many a day.Now the men-at-arms stood each side the Boar, and out from them oneach side stood the two hornsmen:  then these blew up again, whereonthe Alderman stood up and cried:'Ye sons of the brave who have any deed that ye may be desirous ofdoing, come up, come lay your hand on the sword, and the point of thesword to the Holy Beast, and swear the oath that lieth on yourhearts.'Therewith he sat down, and there strode a man up the hall, strong-built and sturdy, but short of stature; black-haired, red-bearded,and ruddy-faced:  and he stood on the dais, and took up the sword andlaid its point on the Boar, and said:'I am Bristler, son of Brightling, a man of the Shepherds.  Here bythe Holy Boar I swear to follow up the ransackers of Penny-thumb andthe slayers of Rusty.  And I take this feud upon me, although they beno good men, because I am of the kin and it falleth to me, sinceothers forbear; and when the Court was hallowed hereon I was away outof the Dale and the Downs.  So help me the Warrior, and the God ofthe Earth.'Then the Alderman nodded his head to him kindly, and reached him outa cup of wine, and as he drank there went up a rumour of praise fromthe hall; and men said that his oath was manly and that he was liketo keep it; for he was a good man-at-arms and a stout heart.Then came up three men of the Shepherds and two of the Dale and sworeto help Bristler in his feud, and men thought it well sworn.After that came a braggart, a man very gay of his raiment, and sworewith many words that if he lived the year through he would be acaptain over the men of the Plain, and would come back again withmany gifts for his friends in the Dale.  This men deemed foolishlysworn, for they knew the man; so they jeered at him and laughed as hewent back to his place ashamed.Then swore three others oaths not hard to be kept, and men laughedand were merry.At last uprose the Alderman, and said:  'Kinsmen, and good fellows,good days and peaceable are in the Dale as now; and of such dayslittle is the story, and little it availeth to swear a deed ofderring-do:  yet three things I swear by this Beast; and first togainsay no man's asking if I may perform it; and next to set rightabove law and mercy above custom; and lastly, if the days change andwar cometh to us or we go to meet it, I will be no backwarder in theonset than three fathoms behind the foremost.  So help me theWarrior, and the God of the Face and the Holy Earth!'Therewith he sat down, and all men shouted for joy of him, and saidthat it was most like that he would keep his oath.Last of all uprose Face-of-god and took up the sword and looked atit; and so bright was the blade that he saw in it the image of thegolden braveries which the Bride bore, and even some broken image ofher face.  Then he handled the hilt and laid the point on the Boar,and cried:'Hereby I swear to wed the fairest woman of the Earth before the yearis worn to an end; and that whether the Dalesmen gainsay me or themen beyond the Dale.  So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Faceand the Holy Earth!'Therewith he sat down; and once more men shouted for the love of himand of the Bride, and they said he had sworn well and like achieftain.But the Bride noted him that neither were his eyes nor his voice liketo their wont as he swore, for she knew him well; and thereat was sheill at ease, for now whatever was new in him was to her a threat ofevil to come.Stone-face also noted him, and he knew the young man better than allothers save the Bride, and he saw withal that she was ill-pleased,and he said to himself:  'I will speak to my fosterling to-morrow ifI may find him alone.'So came the swearing to an end, and they fell to on their meat andfeasted on the Boar of Atonement after they had duly given the Godstheir due share, and the wine went about the hall and men were merrytill they drank the parting cup and fared to rest in the shut-beds,and whereso else they might in the Hall and the House, for there weremany men there.CHAPTER XII.  STONE-FACE TELLETH CONCERNING THE WOOD-WIGHTSEarly on the morrow Gold-mane arose and clad himself and went out-a-doors and over the trodden snow on to the bridge over the WelteringWater, and there betook himself into one of the coins of safety builtover the up-stream piles; there he leaned against the wall and turnedhis face to the Thorp, and fell to pondering on his case.  And firsthe thought about his oath, and how that he had sworn to wed theMountain Woman, although his kindred and her kindred should gainsayhim, yea and herself also.  Great seemed that oath to him, yet atthat moment he wished he had made it greater, and made all thekindred, yea and the Bride herself, sure of the meaning of the wordsof it:  and he deemed himself a dastard that he had not done so.Then he looked round him and beheld the winter, and he fell into merelonging that the spring were come and the token from the Mountain.Things seemed too hard for him to deal with, and he between a mightyfolk and two wayward women; and he went nigh to wish that he hadtaken his father's offer and gone down to the Cities; and even had hemet his bane:  well were that!  And, as young folk will, he set towork making a picture of his deeds there, had he been there.  Heshowed himself the stricken fight in the plain, and the press, andthe struggle, and the breaking of the serried band, and himselfamidst the ring of foemen doing most valiantly, and falling there atlast, his shield o'er-heavy with the weight of foemen's spears for aman to uphold it.  Then the victory of his folk and the lamentationand praise over the slain man of the Mountain Dales, and the burialof the valiant warrior, the praising weeping folk meeting him at theCity-gate, laid stark and cold in his arms on the gold-hung garlandedbier.There ended his dream, and he laughed aloud and said:  'I am a fool!All this were good and sweet if I should see it myself; and forsooththat is how I am thinking of it, as if I still alive should seemyself dead and famous!'Then he turned a little and looked at the houses of the Thorp lyingdark about the snowy ways under the starlit heavens of the wintermorning:  dark they were indeed and grey, save where here and therethe half-burned Yule-fire reddened the windows of a hall, or where,as in one place, the candle of some early waker shone white in achamber window.  There was scarce a man astir, he deemed, and nosound reached him save the crowing of the cocks muffled by theirhouses, and a faint sound of beasts in the byres.Thus he stood a while, his thoughts wandering now, till presently heheard footsteps coming his way down the street and turned towardthem, and lo it was the old man Stone-face.  He had seen Gold-mane goout, and had risen and followed him that he might talk with himapart.  Gold-mane greeted him kindly, though, sooth to say, he wasbut half content to see him; since he doubted, what was verily thecase, that his foster-father would give him many words, counsellinghim to refrain from going to the wood, and this was loathsome to him;but he spake and said:'Meseems, father, that the eastern sky is brightening toward dawn.''Yea,' quoth Stone-face.'It will be light in an hour,' said Face-of-god.'Even so,' said Stone-face.'And a fair day for the morrow of Yule,' said the swain.'Yea,' said Stone-face, 'and what wilt thou do with the fair day?Wilt thou to the wood?''Maybe, father,' said Gold-mane; 'Hall-face and some of the swainsare talking of elks up the fells which may be trapped in the drifts,and if they go a-hunting them, I may go in their company.''Ah, son,' quoth Stone-face, 'thou wilt look to see other kind ofbeasts than elks.  Things may ye fall in with there who may not beimpounded in the snow like to elks, but can go light-foot on the topof the soft drift from one place to another.'Said Gold-mane:  'Father, fear me not; I shall either refrain me fromthe wood, or if I go, I shall go to hunt the wood-deer with otherhunters.  But since thou hast come to me, tell me more about thewood, for thy tales thereof are fair.''Yea,' said Stone-face, 'fair tales of foul things, as oft itbefalleth in the world.  Hearken now! if thou deemest that what thouseekest shall come readier to thine hand because of the winter andthe snow, thou errest.  For the wights that waylay the bodies andsouls of the mighty in the wild-wood heed such matters nothing; yeaand at Yule-tide are they most abroad, and most armed for the fray.Even such an one have I seen time agone, when the snow was deep andthe wind was rough; and it was in the likeness of a woman clad insuch raiment as the Bride bore last night, and she trod the snowlight-foot in thin raiment where it would scarce bear the skids of adeft snow-runner.  Even so she stood before me; the icy wind blew herraiment round about her, and drifted the hair from her garlanded headtoward me, and she as fair and fresh as in the midsummer days.  Upthe fell she fared, sweetest of all things to look on, and beckonedon me to follow; on me, the Warrior, the Stout-heart; and I followed,and between us grief was born; but I it was that fostered that childand not she.  Always when she would be, was she merry and lovely; andeven so is she now, for she is of those that be long-lived.  And Iwot that thou hast seen even such an one!''Tell me more of thy tales, foster-father,' said Gold-mane, 'and fearnot for me!''Ah, son,' he said, 'mayst thou have no such tales to tell to thosethat shall be young when thou art old.  Yet hearken!  We sat in thehall together and there was no third; and methought that the birdssang and the flowers bloomed, and sweet was their savour, though itwas midwinter.  A rose-wreath was on her head; grapes were on theboard, and fair unwrinkled summer apples on the day that we feastedtogether.  When was the feast? sayst thou.  Long ago.  What was thehall, thou sayest, wherein ye feasted?  I know not if it were on theearth or under it, or if we rode the clouds that even.  But on themorrow what was there but the stark wood and the drift of the snow,and the iron wind howling through the branches, and a lonely man, awanderer rising from the ground.  A wanderer through the wood and upthe fell, and up the high mountain, and up and up to the edges of theice-river and the green caves of the ice-hills.  A wanderer inspring, in summer, autumn and winter, with an empty heart and aburning never-satisfied desire; who hath seen in the uncouth placesmany an evil unmanly shape, many a foul hag and changing uglysemblance; who hath suffered hunger and thirst and wounding andfever, and hath seen many things, but hath never again seen that fairwoman, or that lovely feast-hall.'All praise and honour to the House of the Face, and the bounteousvaliant men thereof! and the like praise and honour to the fair womenwhom they wed of the valiant and goodly House of the Steer!''Even so say I,' quoth Gold-mane calmly; 'but now wend we aback tothe House, for it is morning indeed, and folk will be stirringthere.'So they turned from the bridge together; and Stone-face was kind andfatherly, and was telling his foster-son many wise things concerningthe life of a chieftain, and the giving-out of dooms and thegathering for battle; to all which talk Face-of-god seemed to hearkengladly, but indeed hearkened not at all; for verily his eyes werebeholding that snowy waste, and the fair woman upon it; even such anone as Stone-face had told of.CHAPTER XIII.  THEY FARE TO THE HUNTING OF THE ELKWhen they came into the Hall, the hearth-fire had been quickened, andthe sleepers on the floor had been wakened, and all folk were astir.So the old man sat down by the hearth while Gold-mane busied himselfin fetching wood and water, and in sweeping out the Hall, and othersuch works of the early morning.  In a little while Hall-face and theother young men and warriors were afoot duly clad, and the Aldermancame from his chamber and greeted all men kindly.  Soon meat was setupon the boards, and men broke their fast; and day dawned while theywere about it, and ere it was all done the sun rose clear and golden,so that all men knew that the day would be fair, for the frost seemedhard and enduring.Then the eager young men and the hunters, and those who knew themountain best drew together about the hearth, and fell to talking ofthe hunting of the elk; and there were three there who knew both thewoods and also the fells right up to the ice-rivers better than anyother; and these said that they who were fain of the hunting of theelk would have no likelier time than that day for a year to come.Short was the rede betwixt them, for they said they would go to thework at once and make the most of the short winter daylight.  So theywent each to his place, and some outside that House to their fathers'houses to fetch each man his gear.  Face-of-god for his part went tohis shut-bed, and stood by his chest, and opened it, and drew out ofit a fine hauberk of ring-mail which his father had made for him:for though Face-of-god was a deft wright, he was not by a long way sodeft as his father, who was the deftest of all men of that time andcountry; so that the alien merchants would give him what he would forhis hauberks and helms, whenso he would chaffer with them, which wasbut seldom.  So Face-of-god did on this hauberk over his kirtle, andover it he cast his foul-weather weed, so that none might see it:  hegirt a strong war-sword to his side, cast his quiver over hisshoulder, and took his bow in his hand, although he had little lustto shoot elks that day, even as Stone-face had said; therewithal hetook his skids, and went forth of the hall to the gate of the Burg;whereto gathered the whole company of twenty-three, and Gold-mane thetwenty-fourth.  And each man there had his skids and his bow andquiver, and whatso other weapon, as short-sword, or wood-knife, oraxe, seemed good to him.So they went out-a-gates, and clomb the stairway in the cliff whichled to the ancient watch-tower:  for it was on the lower slopes ofthe fells which lay near to the Weltering Water that they looked tofind the elks, and this was the nighest road thereto.  When they hadgotten to the top they lost no time, but went their ways nearly dueeast, making way easily where there were but scattered trees close tothe lip of the sheer cliffs.They went merrily on their skids over the close-lying snow, and weresoon up on the great shoulders of the fells that went up from thebank of the Weltering Water:  at noon they came into a little dalewherein were a few trees, and there they abided to eat their meat,and were very merry, making for themselves tables and benches of thedrifted snow, and piling it up to windward as a defence against thewind, which had now arisen, little but bitter from the south-east; sothat some, and they the wisest, began to look for foul weather:wherefore they tarried the shorter while in the said dale or hollow.But they were scarcely on their way again before the aforesaid south-east wind began to grow bigger, and at last blew a gale, and broughtup with it a drift of fine snow, through which they yet made theirway, but slowly, till the drift grew so thick that they could not seeeach other five paces apart.Then perforce they made stay, and gathered together under a bentwhich by good luck they happened upon, where they were sheltered fromthe worst of the drift.  There they abode, till in less than anhour's space the drift abated and the wind fell, and in a littlewhile after it was quite clear, with the sun shining brightly and theyoung waxing moon white and high up in the heavens; and the frost washarder than ever.This seemed good to them; but now that they could see each other'sfaces they fell to telling over their company, and there was nonemissing save Face-of-god.  They were somewhat dismayed thereat, butknew not what to do, and they deemed he might not be far off, eithera little behind or a little ahead; and Hall-face said:'There is no need to make this to-do about my brother; he can takegood care of himself; neither does a warrior of the Face die becauseof a little cold and frost and snow-drift.  Withal Gold-mane is awilful man, and of late days hath been wilful beyond his wont; let usnow find the elks.'So they went on their ways hoping to fall in with him again.  No longstory need be made of their hunting, for not very far from where theyhad taken shelter they came upon the elks, many of them, impounded inthe drifts, pretty much where the deft hunters looked to find them.There then was battle between the elks and the men, till the beastswere all slain and only one man hurt:  then they made them sleighsfrom wood which they found in the hollows thereby, and they laid thecarcasses thereon, and so turned their faces homeward, dragging theirprey with them.  But they met not Face-of-god either there or on theway home; and Hall-face said:  'Maybe Gold-mane will lie on the fellto-night; and I would I were with him; for adventures oft befall suchfolk when they abide in the wilds.'Now it was late at night by then they reached Burgstead, so laden asthey were with the dead beasts; but they heeded the night little, forthe moon was well-nigh as bright as day for them.  But when they cameto the gate of the Thorp, there were assembled the goodmen and swainsto meet them with torches and wine in their honour.  There also wasGold-mane come back before them, yea for these two hours; and hestood clad in his holiday raiment and smiled on them.Then was there some jeering at him that he was come back empty-handedfrom the hunting, and that he was not able to abide the wind and thedrift; but he laughed thereat, for all this was but game and play,since men knew him for a keen hunter and a stout woodsman; and theyhad deemed it a heavy loss of him if he had been cast away, as somefeared he had been:  and his brother Hall-face embraced him andkissed him, and said to him:  'Now the next time that thou farest tothe wood will I be with thee foot to foot, and never leave thee, andthen meseemeth I shall wot of the tale that hath befallen thee, andbelike it shall be no sorry one.'Face-of-god laughed and answered but little, and they all betook themto the House of the Face and held high feast therein, for as late asthe night was, in honour of this Hunting of the Elk.No man cared to question Face-of-god closely as to how or where hehad strayed from the hunt; for he had told his own tale at once assoon as he came home, to wit, that his right-foot skid-strap hadbroken, and even while he stopped to mend it came on that drift andweather; and that he could not move from that place without losinghis way, and that when it had cleared he knew not whither they hadgone because the snow had covered their slot.  So he deemed it notunlike that they had gone back, and that he might come up with one ortwo on the way, and that in any case he wotted well that they couldlook after themselves; so he turned back, not going very swiftly.All this seemed like enough, and a little matter except to jestabout, so no man made any question concerning it:  only old Stone-face said to himself:'Now were I fain to have a true tale out of him, but it is littlelikely that anything shall come of my much questioning; and it is illforcing a young man to tell lies.'So he held his peace, and the feast went on merrily and blithely.CHAPTER XIV.  CONCERNING FACE-OF-GOD AND THE MOUNTAINBut it must be told of Gold-mane that what had befallen him was inthis wise.  His skid-strap brake in good sooth, and he stayed to mendit; but when he had done what was needful, he looked up and saw noman nigh, what for the drift, and that they had gone on somewhat; sohe rose to his feet, and without more delay, instead of keeping ontoward the elk-ground and the way his face had been set, he turnedhimself north-and-by-east, and went his ways swiftly towards thatairt, because he deemed that it might lead him to the Mountain-hallwhere he had guested.  He abode not for the storm to clear, but sweptoff through the thick of it; and indeed the wind was somewhat at hisback, so that he went the swiftlier.  But when the drift was gottento its very worst, he sheltered himself for a little in a hollowbehind a thorn-bush he stumbled upon.  As soon as it began to abatehe went on again, and at last when it was quite clear, and the sunshone out, he found himself on a long slope of the fells covered deepwith smooth white snow, and at the higher end a great crag risingbare fifty feet above the snow, and more rocks, but none so great,and broken ground as he judged (the snow being deep) about it on thehither side; and on the further, three great pine-trees all bent downand mingled together by their load of snow.Thitherward he made, as a man might, seeing nothing else to notebefore him; but he had not made many strides when forth from behindthe crag by the pine-trees came a man; and at first Face-of-godthought it might be one of his hunting-fellows gone astray, and hehailed him in a loud voice, but as he looked he saw the sun flashback from a bright helm on the new-comer's head; albeit he kept onhis way till there was but a space of two hundred yards between them;when lo! the helm-bearer notched a shaft to his bent bow and loosedat Face-of-god, and the arrow came whistling and passed six inches byhis right ear.  Then Face-of-god stopped perplexed with his case; forhe was on the deep snow in his skids, with his bow unbent, and heknew not how to bend it speedily.  He was loth to turn his back andflee, and indeed he scarce deemed that it would help him.  Meanwhileof his tarrying the archer loosed again at him, and this time theshaft flew close to his left ear.  Then Face-of-god thought to casthimself down into the snow, but he was ashamed; till there came athird shaft which flew over his head amidmost and close to it.  'Goodshooting on the Mountain!' muttered he; 'the next shaft will beamidst my breast, and who knows whether the Alderman's handiwork willkeep it out.'So he cried aloud:  'Thou shootest well, brother; but art thou a foe?If thou art, I have a sword by my side, and so hast thou; come hitherto me, and let us fight it out friendly if we must needs fight.'A laugh came down the wind to him clear but somewhat shrill, and thearcher came swiftly towards him on his skids with no weapon in hishand save his bow; so that Face-of-god did not draw his sword, butstood wondering.As they drew nearer he beheld the face of the new-comer, and deemedthat he had seen it before; and soon, for all that it was hoodedclose by the ill-weather raiment, he perceived it to be the face ofBow-may, ruddy and smiling.She laughed out loud again, as she stopped herself within three feetof him, and said:'Yea, friend Yellow-hair, we heard of the elks and looked to see theehereabouts, and I knew thee at once when I came out from behind thecrag and saw thee stand bewildered.'Said Gold-mane:  'Hail to thee, Bow-may! and glad am I to see thee.But thou liest in saying that thou knewest me; else why didst thoushoot those three shafts at me?  Surely thou art not so quick as thatwith all thy friends:  these be sharp greetings of you Mountain-folk.''Thou lad with the sweet mouth,' she said, 'I like to see thee andhear thee talk, but now must I hasten thy departure; so stand we hereno longer.  Let us get down into the wood where we can do off ourskids and sit down, and then will I tell thee the tidings.  Come on!'And she caught his hand in hers, and they went speedily down theslopes toward the great oak-wood, the wind whistling past their ears.'Whither are we going?' said he.Said she:  'I am to show thee the way back home, which thou wilt notknow surely amidst this snow.  Come, no words! thou shalt not have mytale from me till we are in the wood:  so the sooner we are there thesooner shalt thou be pleased.'So Face-of-god held his peace, and they went on swiftly side by side.But it was not Bow-may's wont to be silent for long, so presently shesaid:'Thou art good so do as I bid thee; but see thou, sweet playmate, forall thou art a chieftain's son, thou wert but feather-brained to askme why I shot at thee.  I shoot at thee! that were a fine tale totell her this even!  Or dost thou think that I could shoot at a bigman on the snow at two hundred paces and miss him three times?Unless I aimed to miss.''Yea, Bow-may,' said he, 'art thou so deft a Bow-may?  Thou shalt bein my company whenso I fare to battle.''Indeed,' she said, 'therein thou sayest but the bare truth:  nowhereelse shall I be, and thou shalt find my bow no worse than a goodshield.'He laughed somewhat lightly; but she looked on him soberly and said:'Laugh in that fashion on the day of battle, and we shall be wellcontent with thee!'So on they sped very swiftly, for their way was mostly down hill, sothat they were soon amongst the outskirting trees of the wood, andpresently after reached the edge of the thicket, beyond which theground was but thinly covered with snow.There they took off their skids, and went into the thick wood and satdown under a hornbeam tree; and ere Gold-mane could open his mouth tospeak Bow-may began and said:'Well it was that I fell in with thee, Dalesman, else had there beenmurders of men to tell of; but ever she ordereth all things wisely,though unwisely hast thou done to seek to her.  Hearken! dost thouthink that thou hast done well that thou hast me here with my tale?Well, hadst thou busied thyself with the slaying of elks, or withsitting quietly at home, yet shouldest thou have heard my tale, andthou shouldest have seen me in Burgstead in a day or two to tell theeconcerning the flitting of the token.  And ill it is that I havemissed it, for fain had I been to behold the House of the Face, andto have seen thee sitting there in thy dignity amidst the kindred ofchieftains.'And she sighed therewith.  But he said:  'Hold up thine heart, Bow-may!  On the word of a true man that shall befall thee one day.  Butcome, playmate, give me thy tale!''Yea,' she said, 'I must now tell thee in the wild-wood what else Ihad told thee in the Hall.  Hearken closely, for this is the message:'Seek not to me again till thou hast the token; else assuredly wiltthou be slain, and I shall be sorry for many a day.  Thereof as now Imay not tell thee more.  Now as to the token:  When March is worn twoweeks fail not to go to and fro on the place of the Maiden Ward foran hour before sunrise every day till thou hear tidings.''Now,' quoth Bow-may, 'hast thou hearkened and understood?''Yea,' said he.She said:  'Then tell me the words of my message concerning thetoken.'  And he did so word for word.  Then she said:'It is well, there is no more to say.  Now must I lead thee till thouknowest the wood; and then mayst thou get on to the smooth snowagain, and so home merrily.  Yet, thou grey-eyed fellow, I will havemy pay of thee before I do that last work.'Therewith she turned about to him and took his head between herhands, and kissed him well favouredly both cheeks and mouth; and shelaughed, albeit the tears stood in her eyes as she said:  'Nowsmelleth the wood sweeter, and summer will come back again.  And eventhus will I do once more when we stand side by side in battle array.'He smiled kindly on her and nodded as they both rose up from theearth:  she had taken off her foul-weather gloves while they spake,and he kissed her hand, which was shapely of fashion albeit somewhatbrown, and hard of palm, and he said in friendly wise:'Thou art a merry faring-fellow, Bow-may, and belike shalt be withala true fighting-fellow.  Come now, thou shalt be my sister and I thybrother, in despite of those three shafts across the snow.'He laughed therewith; she laughed not, but seemed glad, and saidsoberly:'Yea, I may well be thy sister; for belike I also am of the people ofthe Gods, who have come into these Dales by many far ways.  I am ofthe House of the Ragged Sword of the Kindred of the Wolf.  Come,brother, let us toward Wildlake's Way.'Therewith she went before him and led through the thicket as by anassured and wonted path, and he followed hard at heel; but histhought went from her for a while; for those words of brother andsister that he had spoken called to his mind the Bride, and theirkindness of little children, and the days when they seemed to havenought to do but to make the sun brighter, and the flowers fairer,and the grass greener, and the birds happier each for the other; anda hard and evil thing it seemed to him that now he should be makingall these things nought and dreary to her, now when he had become aman and deeds lay before him.  Yet again was he solaced by what Bow-may had said concerning battle to come; for he deemed that she musthave had this from the Friend's foreseeing; and he longed sore fordeeds to do, wherein all these things might be cleared up and washenclean as it were.So passed they through the wood a long way, and it was getting darktherein, and Gold-mane said:'Hold now, Bow-may, for I am at home here.'She looked around and said:  'Yea, so it is:  I was thinking of manythings.  Farewell and live merrily till March comes and the token!'Therewith she turned and went her ways and was soon out of sight, andhe went lightly through the wood, and then on skids over the hardsnow along the Dale's edge till he was come to the watch-tower, whenthe moon was bright in heaven.Thus was he at Burgstead and the House of the Face betimes, andbefore the hunters were gotten back.CHAPTER XV.  MURDER AMONGST THE FOLK OF THE WOODLANDERSSo wore away midwinter tidingless.  Stone-face spake no more to Face-of-god about the wood and its wights, when he saw that the young manhad come back hale and merry, seemed not to crave over-much to goback thither.  As for the Bride, she was sad, and more thanmisdoubted all; but dauntless as she was in matters that try men'shardihood, she yet lacked heart to ask of Face-of-god what hadbefallen him since the autumn-tide, or where he was with her.  So sheput a force upon herself not to look sad or craving when she was inhis company, as full oft she was; for he rather sought her thanshunned her.  For when he saw her thus, he deemed things werechanging with her as they had changed with him, and he bethought himof what he had spoken to Bow-may, and deemed that even so he mightspeak with the Bride when the time came, and that she would not begrieved beyond measure, and all would be well.Now came on the thaw, and the snow went, and the grass grew all upand down the Dale, and all waters were big.  And about this timearose rumours of strange men in the wood, uncouth, vile, andmurderous, and many of the feebler sort were made timorous thereby.But a little before March was born came new tidings from theWoodlanders; to wit:  There came on a time to the house of a woodlandcarle, a worthy goodman well renowned of all, two wayfarers in thefirst watch of the night; and these men said that they were wendingdown to the Plain from a far-away dale, Rose-dale to wit, which allmen had heard of, and that they had strayed from the way and wereexceeding weary, and they craved a meal's meat and lodging for thenight.This the goodman might nowise gainsay, and he saw no harm in it,wherefore he bade them abide and be merry.These men, said they who told the tidings, were outlanders, and noman had seen any like them before:  they were armed, and bore shortbows made of horn, and round targets, and coats-of-fence done overwith horn scales; they had crooked swords girt to their sides, andaxes of steel forged all in one piece, right good weapons.  They wereclad in scarlet and had much silver on their raiment and about theirweapons, and great rings of the same on their arms; and all thissilver seemed brand-new.Now the Woodland Carle gave them of such things as he had, and waskind and blithe to them:  there were in his house besides himselffive men of his sons and kindred, and his wife and three daughtersand two other maids.  So they feasted after the Woodlanders' fashion,and went to bed a little before midnight.  Two hours after, the carleawoke and heard a little stir, and he looked and saw the guests ontheir feet amidst the hall clad in all their war-gear; and they hadbetwixt them his two youngest daughters, maids of fifteen and twelvewinters, and had bound their hands and done clouts over their mouths,so that they might not cry out; and they were just at point to carrythem off.  Thereat the goodman, naked as he was, caught up his swordand made at these murder-carles, and or ever they were ware of him hehad hewn down one and turned to face the other, who smote at him withhis steel axe and gave him a great wound on the shoulder, andtherewithal fled out at the open door and forth into the wood.The Woodlander made no stay to raise the cry (there was no need, forthe hall was astir now from end to end, and men getting to theirweapons), but ran out after the felon even as he was; and, in spiteof his grievous hurt, overran him no long way from the house beforehe had gotten into the thicket.  But the man was nimble and strong,and the goodman unsteady from his wound, and by then the others ofthe household came up with the hue and cry he had gotten two moresore wounds and was just making an end of throttling the felon withhis bare hands.  So he fell into their arms fainting from weakness,and for all they could do he died in two hours' time from that axe-wound in his shoulder, and another on the side of the head, and aknife-thrust in his side; and he was a man of sixty winters.But the stranger he had slain outright; and the one whom he hadsmitten in the hall died before the dawn, thrusting all help aside,and making no sound of speech.When these tidings came to Burgstead they seemed great to men, and toGold-mane more than all.  So he and many others took their weaponsand fared up to Wildlake's Way, and so came to the Woodland Carles.But the Woodlanders had borne out the carcasses of those felons andlaid them on the green before Wood-grey's door (for that was the nameof the dead goodman), and they were saying that they would not burysuch accursed folk, but would bear them a little way so that theyshould not be vexed with the stink of them, and cast them into thethicket for the wolf and the wild-cat and the stoat to deal with; andthey should lie there, weapons and silver and all; and they deemed itbase to strip such wretches, for who would wear their raiment or beartheir weapons after them.There was a great ring of folk round about them when they ofBurgstead drew near, and they shouted for joy to see theirneighbours, and made way before them.  Then the Dalesmen cursed thesemurderers who had slain so good a man, and they all praised hismanliness, whereas he ran out into the night naked and wounded afterhis foe, and had fallen like his folk of old time.It was a bright spring afternoon in that clearing of the Wood, andthey looked at the two dead men closely; and Gold-mane, who had beensomewhat silent and moody till then, became merry and wordy; for hebeheld the men and saw that they were utterly strange to him:  theywere short of stature, crooked-legged, long-armed, very strong fortheir size:  with small blue eyes, snubbed-nosed, wide-mouthed, thin-lipped, very swarthy of skin, exceeding foul of favour.  He and allothers wondered who they were, and whence they came, for never hadthey seen their like; and the Woodlanders, who often guestedoutlanders strayed from the way of divers kindreds and nations, saidalso that none such had they ever seen.  But Stone-face, who stood byGold-mane, shook his head and quoth he:'The Wild-wood holdeth many marvels, and these be of them:  the spawnof evil wights quickeneth therein, and at other whiles it meltethaway again like the snow; so may it be with these carcasses.'And some of the older folk of the Woodlanders who stood by hearkenedwhat he said, and deemed his words wise, for they remembered theirancient lore and many a tale of old time.Thereafter they of Burgstead went into Wood-grey's hall, or as manyof them as might, for it was but a poor place and not right great.There they saw the goodman laid on the dais in all his war-gear,under the last tie-beam of his hall, whereon was carved amidst muchgoodly work of knots and flowers and twining stems the image of theWolf of the Waste, his jaws open and gaping:  the wife and daughtersof the goodman and other women of the folk stood about the biersinging some old song in a low voice, and some sobbing therewithal,for the man was much beloved:  and much people of the Woodlanders wasin the hall, and it was somewhat dusk within.So the Burgstead men greeted that folk kindly and humbly, and againthey fell to praising the dead man, saying how his deed should longbe remembered in the Dale and wide about; and they called him afearless man and of great worth.  And the women hearkened, and ceasedtheir crooning and their sobbing, and stood up proudly and raisedtheir heads with gleaming eyes; and as the words of the Burgstead menended, they lifted up their voices and sang loudly and clearly,standing together in a row, ten of them, on the dais of that poorhall, facing the gable and the wolf-adorned tie-beam, heeding noughtas they sang what was about or behind them.And this is some of what they sang:Why sit ye bare in the spinning-room?Why weave ye naked at the loom?Bare and white as the moon we be,That the Earth and the drifting night may see.Now what is the worst of all your work?What curse amidst the web shall lurk?The worst of the work our hands shall winIs wrack and ruin round the kin.Shall the woollen yarn and the flaxen threadBe gear for living men or dead?The woollen yarn and the flaxen threadShall flare 'twixt living men and dead.O what is the ending of your day?When shall ye rise and wend away?Our day shall end to-morrow morn,When we hear the voice of the battle-horn.Where first shall eyes of men beholdThis weaving of the moonlight cold?There where the alien host abidesThe gathering on the Mountain-sides.How long aloft shall the fair web flyWhen the bows are bent and the spears draw nigh?From eve to morn and morn till eveAloft shall fly the work we weave.What then is this, the web ye win?What wood-beast waxeth stark therein?We weave the Wolf and the gift of warFrom the men that were to the men that are.So sang they:  and much were all men moved at their singing, andthere was none but called to mind the old days of the Fathers, andthe years when their banner went wide in the world.But the Woodlanders feasted them of Burgstead what they might, andthen went the Dalesmen back to their houses; but on the morrow'smorrow they fared thither again, and Wood-grey was laid in moundamidst a great assemblage of the Folk.Many men said that there was no doubt that those two felons were ofthe company of those who had ransacked the steads of Penny-thumb andHarts-bane; and so at first deemed Bristler the son of Brightling:but after a while, when he had had time to think of it, he changedhis mind; for he said that such men as these would have slain firstand ransacked afterwards:  and some who loved neither Penny-thumb norHarts-bane said that they would not have been at the pains to choosefor ransacking the two worst men about the Dale, whose loss was noloss to any but themselves.As for Gold-mane he knew not what to think, except that his friendsof the Mountain had had nought to do with it.So wore the days awhile.CHAPTER XVI.  THE BRIDE SPEAKETH WITH FACE-OF-GODFebruary had died into March, and March was now twelve days old, on afair and sunny day an hour before noon; and Face-of-god was in ameadow a scant mile down the Dale from Burgstead.  He had beendriving a bull into a goodman's byre nearby, and had had to spendtoil and patience both in getting him out of the fields and into thebyre; for the beast was hot with the spring days and the new grass.So now he was resting himself in happy mood in an exceeding pleasantplace, a little meadow to wit, on one side whereof was a greatorchard or grove of sweet chestnuts, which went right up to the feetof the Southern Cliffs:  across the meadow ran a clear brook towardsthe Weltering Water, free from big stones, in some places dammed upfor the flooding of the deep pasture-meadow, and with the grassgrowing on its lips down to the very water.  There was a low bankjust outside the chestnut trees, as if someone had raised a dykeabout them when they were young, which had been trodden low andspreading through the lapse of years by the faring of many men andbeasts.  The primroses bloomed thick upon it now, and here and therealong it was a low blackthorn bush in full blossom; from the mid-meadow and right down to the lip of the brook was the grass well nighhidden by the blossoms of the meadow-saffron, with daffodilssprinkled about amongst them, and in the trees and bushes the birds,and chiefly the blackbirds, were singing their loudest.There sat Face-of-god on the bank resting after his toil, and happywas his mood; since in two days' wearing he should be pacing theMaiden Ward awaiting the token that was to lead him to Shadowy Vale;so he sat calling to mind the Friend as he had last seen her, andstriving as it were to set her image standing on the flowery grassbefore him, till all the beauty of the meadow seemed bare and emptyto him without her.  Then it fell into his mind that this had been abeloved trysting-place betwixt him and the Bride, and that often whenthey were little would they come to gather chestnuts in the grove,and thereafter sit and prattle on the old dyke; or in spring when theseason was warm would they go barefoot into the brook, seeking itstreasures of troutlets and flowers and clean-washed agate pebbles.Yea, and time not long ago had they met here to talk as lovers, andsat on that very bank in all the kindness of good days without ablemish, and both he and she had loved the place well for its wealthof blossoms and deep grass and goodly trees and clear running stream.As he thought of all this, and how often there he had praised tohimself her beauty, which he scarce dared praise to her, he frownedand slowly rose to his feet, and turned toward the chestnut-grove, asthough he would go thence that way; but or ever he stepped down fromthe dyke he turned about again, and even therewith, like the veryimage and ghost of his thought, lo! the Bride herself coming up fromout the brook and wending toward him, her wet naked feet gleaming inthe sun as they trod down the tender meadow-saffron and brushed pastthe tufts of daffodils.  He stood staring at her discomforted, for onthat day he had much to think of that seemed happy to him, and hedeemed that she would now question him, and his mind pondered diversways of answering her, and none seemed good to him.  She drew nearand let her skirts fall over her feet, and came to him, her gown hemdragging over the flowers:  then she stood straight up before him andgreeted him, but reached not forth her hand to him nor touched him.Her face was paler that its wont, and her voice trembled as she spaketo him and said:'Face-of-god, I would ask thee a gift.''All gifts,' he said, 'that thou mayest ask, and I may give, lie opento thee.'She said:  'If I be alive when the time comes this gift thou maystwell give me.''Sweet kinswoman,' said he, 'tell me what it is that thou wouldesthave of me.'  And he was ill-at-ease as he waited for her answer.She said:  'Ah, kinsman, kinsman!  Woe on the day that maketh kinshipaccursed to me because thou desirest it!'He held his peace and was exceeding sorry; and she said:'This is the gift that I ask of thee, that in the days to come whenthou art wedded, thou wilt give me the second man-child whom thoubegettest.'He said:  'This shalt thou have, and would that I might give theemuch more.  Would that we were little children together other again,as when we played here in other days.'She said:  'I would have a token of thee that thou shalt show to theGod, and swear on it to give me the gift.  For the times change.''What token wilt thou have?' said he.She said:  'When next thou farest to the Wood, thou shalt bring meback, it maybe a flower from the bank ye sit upon, or a splinter fromthe dais of the hall wherein ye feast, or maybe a ring or some matterthat the strangers are wont to wear.  That shall be the token.'She spoke slowly, hanging her head adown, but she lifted it presentlyand looked into his face and said:'Woe's me, woe's me, Gold-mane!  How evil is this day, when bewailingme I may not bewail thee also!  For I know that thine heart is glad.All through the winter have I kept this hidden in my heart, and durstnot speak to thee.  But now the spring-tide hath driven me to it.Let summer come, and who shall say?'Great was his grief, and his shame kept him silent, and he had noword to say; and again she said:'Tell me, Gold-mane, when goest thou thither?'He said:  'I know not surely, may happen in two days, may happen inten.  Why askest thou?''O friend!' she said, 'is it a new thing that I should ask theewhither thou goest and whence thou comest, and the times of thycoming and going.  Farewell to-day!  Forget not the token.  Woe's me,that I may not kiss thy fair face!'She spread her arms abroad and lifted up her face as one who waileth,but no sound came from her lips; then she turned about and went awayas she had come.But as for him he stood there after she was gone in all confusion, asif he were undone:  for he felt his manhood lessened that he shouldthus and so sorely have hurt a friend, and in a manner against hiswill.  And yet he was somewhat wroth with her, that she had come uponhim so suddenly, and spoken to him with such mastery, and in so fewwords, and he with none to make answer to her, and that she had somarred his pleasure and his hope of that fair day.  Then he sat himdown again on the flowery bank, and little by little his heartsoftened, and he once more called to mind many a time when they hadbeen there before, and the plays and the games they had had togetherthere when they were little.  And he bethought him of the days thatwere long to him then, and now seemed short to him, and as if theywere all grown together into one story, and that a sweet one.  Thenhis breast heaved with a sob, and the tears rose to his eyes andburned and stung him, and he fell a-weeping for that sweet tale, andwept as he had wept once before on that old dyke when there had beensome child's quarrel between them, and she had gone away and lefthim.Then after a while he ceased his weeping, and looked about him lestanyone might be coming, and then he arose and went to and fro in thechestnut-grove for a good while, and afterwards went his ways fromthat meadow, saying to himself:  'Yet remaineth to me the morrow ofto-morrow, and that is the first of the days of the watching for thetoken.'But all that day he was slow to meet the eyes of men; and in the hallthat eve he was silent and moody; for from time to time it came overhim that some of his manhood had departed from him.CHAPTER XVII.  THE TOKEN COMETH FROM THE MOUNTAINThe next day wore away tidingless; and the day after Face-of-godarose betimes; for it was the first day of his watch, and he was atthe Maiden Ward before the time appointed on a very fair and brightmorning, and he went to and fro on that place, and had no tidings.So he came away somewhat cast down, and said within himself:  'Is itbut a lie and a mocking when all is said?'On the morrow he went thither again, and the morn was wild and stormywith drift of rain, and low clouds hurrying over the earth, thoughfor the sunrise they lifted a little in the east, and the sun came upover the passes, amidst the red and angry rack of clouds.  This mornalso gave him no tidings of the token, and he was wroth and perturbedin spirit:  but towards evening he said:'It is well:  ten days she gave me, so that she might be able to sendwithout fail on one of them; she will not fail me.'So again on the morrow he was there betimes, and the morn was windyas on the day before, but the clouds higher and of better promise forthe day.  Face-of-god walked to and fro on the Maiden Ward, and as heturned toward Burgstead for the tenth time, he heard, as he deemed, abow-string twang afar off, and even therewith came a shaft flyingheavily like a winged bird, which smote a great standing stone on theother side of the way, where of old some chieftain had been buried,and fell to earth at its foot.  He went up to it and handled it, andsaw that there was a piece of thin parchment wrapped about it, whichindeed he was eager to unwrap at once, but forebore; because he wason the highway, and people were already astir, and even then passedby him a goodman of the Dale with a man of his going afield together,and they gave him the sele of the day.  So he went along the highwaya little till he came to a place where was a footbridge over into themeadow.  He crossed thereby and went swiftly till he reached a risingground grown over with hazel-trees; there he sat down among therabbit-holes, the primrose and wild-garlic blooming about him, andthree blackbirds answering one another from the edges of the coppice.Straightway when he had looked and seen none coming he broke thethreads that were wound about the scroll and the arrow, and unrolledthe parchment; and there was writing thereon in black ink of smallletters, but very fair, and this is what he read therein:Come thou to the Mountain Hall by the path which thou knowest of, onthe morrow of the day whereon thou readest this.  Rise betimes andcome armed, for there are other men than we in the wood; to whom thydeath should be a gain.  When thou art come to the Hall, thou shaltfind no man therein; but a great hound only, tied to a bench nigh thedais.  Call him by his name, Sure-foot to wit, and give him to eatfrom the meat upon the board, and give him water to drink.  If theday is then far spent, as it is like to be, abide thou with the houndin the hall through the night, and eat of what thou shalt find there;but see that the hound fares not abroad till the morrow's morn:  thenlead him out and bring him to the north-east corner of the Hall, andhe shall lift the slot for thee that leadeth to the Shadowy Yale.Follow him and all good go with thee.Now when he had read this, earth seemed fair indeed about him, and hescarce knew whither to turn or what to do to make the most of hisjoy.  He presently went back to Burgstead and into the House of theFace, where all men were astir now, and the day was clearing.  He hidthe shaft under his kirtle, for he would not that any should see it;so he went to his shut-bed and laid it up in his chest, wherein hekept his chiefest treasures; but the writing on the scroll he set inhis bosom and so hid it.  He went joyfully and proudly, as one whoknoweth more tidings and better than those around him.  But Stone-face beheld him, and said 'Foster-son, thou art happy.  Is it thatthe spring-tide is in thy blood, and maketh thee blithe with allthings, or hast thou some new tidings?  Nay, I would not have ananswer out of thee; but here is good rede:  when next thou goest intothe wood, it were nought so ill for thee to have a valiant old carleby thy side; one that loveth thee, and would die for thee if needwere; one who might watch when thou wert seeking.  Or else beware!for there are evil things abroad in the Wood, and moreover thebrethren of those two felons who were slain at Carlstead.'Then Gold-mane constrained himself to answer the old carle softly;and he thanked him kindly for his offer, and said that so it shouldbe before long.  So the talk between them fell, and Stone-face wentaway somewhat well-pleased.And now was Face-of-god become wary; and he would not draw men's eyesand speech on him; so he went afield with Hall-face to deal with thelambs and the ewes, and did like other men.  No less wary was he inthe hall that even, and neither spake much nor little; and when hisfather spake to him concerning the Bride, and made game of him as asomewhat sluggish groom, he did not change countenance, but answeredlightly what came to hand.On the morrow ere the earliest dawn he was afoot, and he clad himselfand did on his hauberk, his father's work, which was fine-wrought anda stout defence, and reached down to his knees; and over that he didon a goodly green kirtle well embroidered:  he girt his war-sword tohis side, and it was the work of his father's father, and a very goodsword:  its name was Dale-warden.  He did a good helm on his head,and slung a targe at his back, and took two spears in his hand, shortbut strong-shafted and well-steeled.  Thus arrayed he left Burgsteadbefore the dawn, and came to Wildlake's Way and betook him to theWoodland.  He made no stop or stay on the path, but ate his meatstanding by an oak-tree close by the half-blind track.  When he cameto the little wood-lawn, where was the toft of the ancient house, helooked all round about him, for he deemed that a likely place forthose ugly wood-wights to set on him; but nought befell him, thoughhe stooped and drank of the woodland rill warily enough.  So hepassed on; and there were other places also where he fared warily,because they seemed like to hold lurking felons; though forsooth thewhole wood might well serve their turn.  But no evil befell him, andat last, when it yet lacked an hour to sunset, he came to the wood-lawn where Wild-wearer had made his onset that other eve.He went straight up to the house, his heart beating, and he scarcebelieving but that he should find the Friend abiding him there:  butwhen he pushed the door it gave way before him at once, and heentered and found no man therein, and the walls stripped bare and noshield or weapon hanging on the panels.  But the hound he saw tied toa bench nigh the dais, and the bristles on the beast's neck arose,and he snarled on Face-of-god, and strained on his leathern leash.Then Face-of-god went up to him and called him by his name, Sure-foot, and gave him his hand to lick, and he brought him water, andfed him with flesh from the meat on the board; so the beast becamefriendly and wagged his tail and whined and slobbered his hand.Then he went all about the house, and saw and heard no living thingtherein save the mice in the panels and Sure-foot.  So he came backto the dais, and sat him down at the board and ate his fill, andthought concerning his case.  And it came into his mind that theWoman of the Mountain had some deed for him to do which would try hismanliness and exalt his fame; and his heart rose high and he wasglad, and he saw himself sitting beside her on the dais of a veryfair hall beloved and honoured of all the folk, and none had aught tosay against him or owed him any grudge.  Thus he pleased himself inthinking of the good days to come, sitting there till the hall grewdusk and dark and the night-wind moaned about it.Then after a while he arose and raked together the brands on thehearth, and made light in the hall and looked to the door.  And hefound there were bolts and bars thereto, so he shot the bolts anddrew the bars into their places and made all as sure as might be.Then he brought Sure-foot down from the dais, and tied him up so thathe might lie down athwart the door, and then lay down his hauberkwith his naked sword ready to his hand, and slept long while.When he awoke it was darker than when he had lain him for the moonhad set; yet he deemed that the day was at point of breaking.  So hefetched water and washed the night off him, and saw a little glimmerof the dawn.  Then he ate somewhat of the meat on the board, and didon his helm and his other gear, and unbarred the door, and led Sure-foot without, and brought him to the north-east corner of the house,and in a little while he lifted the slot and they departed, the manand the hound, just as broke dawn from over the mountains.Sure-foot led right into the heart of the pine-wood, and it was darkenough therein, with nought but a feeble glimmer for some while, andlong was the way therethrough; but in two hours' space was theresomething of a break, and they came to the shore of a dark deep tarnon whose windless and green waters the daylight shone fully.  Thehound skirted the water, and led on unchecked till the trees began togrow smaller and the air colder for all that the sun was higher; forthey had been going up and up all the way.So at last after a six hours' journey they came clean out of thepine-wood, and before them lay the black wilderness of the baremountains, and beyond them, looking quite near now, the great ice-peaks, the wall of the world.  It was but an hour short of noon bythis time, and the high sun shone down on a barren boggy moss whichlay betwixt them and the rocky waste.  Sure-foot made no stay, butthreaded the ways that went betwixt the quagmires, and in anotherhour led Face-of-god into a winding valley blinded by great rocks,and everywhere stony and rough, with a trickle of water runningamidst of it.  The hound fared on up the dale to where the water wasbridged by a great fallen stone, and so over it and up a steep benton the further side, on to a marvellously rough mountain-neck, whilesmere black sand cumbered with scattered rocks and stones, whilesbeset with mires grown over with the cottony mire-grass; here andthere a little scanty grass growing; otherwhere nought but dwarfwillow ever dying ever growing, mingled with moss or red-blossomedsengreen; and all blending together into mere desolation.Few living things they saw there; up on the neck a few sheep weregrazing the scanty grass, but there was none to tend them; yet Face-of-god deemed the sight of them good, for there must be men anigh whoowned them.  For the rest, the whimbrel laughed across the mires;high up in heaven a great eagle was hanging; once and again a greyfox leapt up before them, and the heath-fowl whirred up from underFace-of-god's feet.  A raven who was sitting croaking on a rock inthat first dale stirred uneasily on his perch as he saw them, andwhen they were passed flapped his wings and flew after them croakingstill.Now they fared over that neck somewhat east, making but slow waybecause the ground was so broken and rocky; and in another hour'sspace Sure-foot led down-hill due east to where the stony neck sankinto another desolate miry heath still falling toward the east, butwhose further side was walled by a rampart of crags cleft at theirtops into marvellous-shapes, coal-black, ungrassed and unmossed.Thitherward the hound led straight, and Gold-mane followed wondering:as he drew near them he saw that they were not very high, the tallestpeak scant fifty feet from the face of the heath.They made their way through the scattered rocks at the foot of thesecrags, till, just where the rock-wall seemed the closest, the waythrough the stones turned into a path going through it skew-wise; andit was now so clear a path that belike it had been bettered by men'shands.  Down thereby Face-of-god followed the hound, deeming that hewas come to the gates of the Shadowy Vale, and the path went downsteeply and swiftly.  But when he had gone down a while, the rocks onhis right hand sank lower for a space, so that he could look over andsee what lay beneath.There lay below him a long narrow vale quite plain at the bottom,walled on the further side as on the hither by sheer rocks of blackstone.  The plain was grown over with grass, but he could see no treetherein:  a deep river, dark and green, ran through the vale,sometimes through its midmost, sometimes lapping the further rock-wall:  and he thought indeed that on many a day in the year the sunwould never shine on that valley.Thus much he saw, and then the rocks rose again and shut it from hissight; and at last they drew so close together over head that he wasin a way going through a cave with little daylight coming from above,and in the end he was in a cave indeed and mere darkness:  but withthe last feeble glimmer of light he thought he saw carved on a smoothspace of the living rock at his left hand the image of a wolf.This cave lasted but a little way, and soon the hound and the manwere going once more between sheer black rocks, and the path grewsteeper yet and was cut into steps.  At last there was a sharp turn,and they stood on the top of a long stony scree, down which Sure-footbounded eagerly, giving tongue as he went; but Face-of-god stoodstill and looked, for now the whole Dale lay open before him.That river ran from north to south, and at the south end the cliffsdrew so close to it that looking thence no outgate could be seen; butat the north end there was as it were a dreary street of rocks, theriver flowing amidmost and leaving little foothold on either side,somewhat as it was with the pass leading from the mountains intoBurgdale.Amidmost of the Dale a little toward the north end he saw a doom-ringof black stones, and hard by it an ancient hall builded of the sameblack stone both wall and roof, and thitherward was Sure-foot nowrunning.  Face-of-god looked up and down the Dale and could see nobreak in the wall of sheer rock:  toward the southern end he saw afew booths and cots built roughly of stone and thatched with turf;thereabout he saw a few folk moving about, the most of whom seemed tobe women and children; there were some sheep and lambs near thesecots, and a herd of fifty or so of somewhat goodly mountain-kine werefeeding higher up the valley.  He could look down into the river fromwhere he stood, and he saw that it ran between rocky banks goingstraight down from the face of the meadow, which was rather highabove the water, so that it seemed little likely that the watershould rise over its banks, either in summer or winter; and in summerwas it like to be highest, because the vale was so near to the highmountains and their snows.CHAPTER XVIII.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND IN SHADOWY VALEIt was now about two hours after noon, and a broad band of sunlightlay upon the grass of the vale below Gold-mane's feet; he wentlightly down the scree, and strode forward over the level grasstoward the Doom-ring, his helm and war-gear glittering bright in thesun.  He must needs go through the Doom-ring to come to the Hall, andas he stepped out from behind the last of the big upright-stones, hesaw a woman standing on the threshold of the Hall-door, which was butsome score of paces from him, and knew her at once for the Friend.She was clad like himself in a green kirtle gaily embroidered andfitting close to her body, and had no gown or cloak over it; she hada golden fillet on her head beset with blue mountain stones, and herhair hung loose behind her.Her beauty was so exceeding, and so far beyond all memory of her thathis mind had held, that once more fear of her fell upon Face-of-god,and he stood still with beating heart till she should speak to him.But she came forward swiftly with both her hands held out, smilingand happy-faced, and looking very kindly on him, and she took hishands and said to him:'Now welcome, Gold-mane, welcome, Face-of-god! and twice welcome artthou and threefold.  Lo! this is the day that thou asked for:  artthou happy in it?'He lifted her hands to his lips and kissed them timorously, but saidnought; and therewithal Sure-foot came running forth from the Hall,and fell to bounding round about them, barking noisily after themanner of dogs who have met their masters again; and still she heldhis hands and beheld him kindly.  Then she called the hound to her,and patted him on the neck and quieted him, and then turned to Face-of-god and laughed happily and said:'I do not bid thee hold thy peace; yet thou sayest nought.  Is wellwith thee?''Yea,' he said, 'and more than well.''Thou seemest to me a goodly warrior,' she said; 'hast thou met anyfoemen yesterday or this morning?''Nay,' said he, 'none hindered me; thou hast made the ways easy tome.'She said soberly, 'Such as I might do, I did.  But we may not wieldeverything, for our foes are many, and I feared for thee.  But comethou into our house, which is ours, and far more ours than the boothbefore the pine-wood.'She took his hand again and led him toward the door, but Face-of-godlooked up, and above the lintel he saw carved on the dark stone thatimage of the Wolf, even as he had seen it carved on Wood-grey's tie-beam; and therewith such thoughts came into his mind that he stoppedto look, pressing the Friend's hand hard as though bidding her noteit.  The stone wherein the image was carved was darker than the otherbuilding stones, and might be called black; the jaws of the wood-beast were open and gaping, and had been painted with cinnabar, butwind and weather had worn away the most of the colour.Spake the Friend:  'So it is:  thou beholdest the token of the Godand Father of out Fathers, that telleth the tale of so many days,that the days which now pass by us be to them but as the drop in thesea of waters.  Thou beholdest the sign of our sorrow, the memory ofour wrong; yet is it also the token of our hope.  Maybe it shall leadthee far.''Whither?' said he.  But she answered not a great while, and helooked at her as she stood a-gazing on the image, and saw how thetears stole out of her eyes and ran adown her cheeks.  Then againcame the thought to him of Wood-grey's hall, and the women of thekindred standing before the Wolf and singing of him; and though therewas little comeliness in them and she was so exceeding beauteous, hecould not but deem that they were akin to her.But after a while she wiped the tears from her face and turned to himand said:  'My friend, the Wolf shall lead thee no-whither but whereI also shall be, whatsoever peril or grief may beset the road or lurkat the ending thereof.  Thou shalt be no thrall, to labour while Ilook on.'His heart swelled within him as she spoke, and he was at point tobeseech her love that moment; but now her face had grown gay andbright again, and she said while he was gathering words to speakwithal:'Come in, Gold-mane, come into our house; for I have many things tosay to thee.  And moreover thou art so hushed, and so fearsome in thymail, that I think thou yet deemest me to be a Wight of the Waste,such as Stone-face thy Fosterer told thee tales of, and forewarnedthee.  So would I eat before thee, and sign the meat with the sign ofthe Earth-god's Hammer, to show thee that he is in error concerningme, and that I am a very woman flesh and fell, as my kindred werebefore me.'He laughed and was exceeding glad, and said:  'Tell me now, kindfriend, dost thou deem that Stone-face's tales are mere mockery ofhis dreams, and that he is beguiled by empty semblances or less?  Orare there such Wights in the Waste.''Nay,' she said, 'the man is a true man; and of these things arethere many ancient tales which we may not doubt.  Yet so it is thatsuch wights have I never yet seen, nor aught to scare me save evilmen:  belike it is that I have been over-much busied in dealing withsorrow and ruin to look after them:  or it may be that they feared meand the wrath-breeding grief of the kindred.'He looked at her earnestly, and the wisdom of her heart seemed toenter into his; but she said:  'It is of men we must talk, and of meand thee.  Come with me, my friend.'And she stepped lightly over the threshold and drew him in.  The Hallwas stern and grim and somewhat dusky, for its windows were butsmall:  it was all of stone, both walls and roof.  There was notimber-work therein save the benches and chairs, a little about thedoors at the lower end that led to the buttery and out-bowers; andthis seemed to have been wrought of late years; yea, the chairsagainst the gable on the dais were of stone built into the wall,adorned with carving somewhat sparingly, the image of the Wolf beingdone over the midmost of them.  He looked up and down the Hall, anddeemed it some seventy feet over all from end to end; and he couldsee in the dimness those same goodly hangings on the wall which hehad seen in the woodland booth.She led him up to the dais, and stood there leaning up against thearm of one of those stone seats silent for a while; then she turnedand looked at him, and said:'Yea, thou lookest a goodly warrior; yet am I glad that thou camesthither without battle.  Tell me, Gold-mane,' she said, taking one ofhis spears from his hand, 'art thou deft with the spear?''I have been called so,' said he.She looked at him sweetly and said:  'Canst thou show me the feat ofspear-throwing in this Hall, or shall we wend outside presently thatI may see thee throw?''The Hall sufficeth,' he said.  'Shall I set this steel in the lintelof the buttery door yonder?''Yea, if thou canst,' she said.He smiled and took the spear from her, and poised it and shook ittill it quivered again, then suddenly drew back his arm and cast, andthe shaft sped whistling down the dim hall, and smote the aforesaiddoor-lintel and stuck there quivering:  then he sprang down from thedais, and ran down the hall, and put forth his hand and pulled itforth from the wood, and was on the dais again in a trice, and castagain, and the second time set the spear in the same place, and thentook his other spear from the board and cast it, and there stood thetwo staves in the wood side by side; then he went soberly down thehall and drew them both out of the wood and came back to her, whileshe stood watching him, her cheek flushed, her lips a little parted.She said:  'Good spear-casting, forsooth! and far above what our folkcan do, who be no great throwers of the spear.'Gold-mane laughed:  'Sooth is that,' said he, 'or hardly were I hereto teach thee spear-throwing.''Wilt thou NEVER be paid for that simple onslaught?' she said.'Have I been paid then?' said he.She reddened, for she remembered her word to him on the mountain; andhe put his hand on her shoulder and kissed her cheek, but timorously;nor did she withstand him or shrink aback, but said soberly:'Good indeed is thy spear-throwing, and meseems my brother will lovethee when he hath seen thee strike a stroke or two in wrath.  But,fair warrior, there be no foemen here:  so get thee to the lower endof the Hall, and in the bower beyond shalt thou find fresh water;there wash the waste from off thee, and do off thine helm andhauberk, and come back speedily and eat with me; for I hunger, and sodost thou.'He did as she bade him, and came back presently bearing in his handboth helm and hauberk, and he looked light-limbed and trim andlissome, an exceeding goodly man.CHAPTER XIX.  THE FAIR WOMAN TELLETH FACE-OF-GOD OF HER KINDREDWhen he came back to the dais he saw that there was meat upon theboard, and the Friend said to him:'Now art thou Gold-mane indeed:  but come now, sit by me and eat,though the Wood-woman giveth thee but a sorry banquet, O guest; butfrom the Dale it is, and we be too far now from the dwellings of mento have delicate meat on the board, though to-night when they comeback thy cheer shall be better.  Yet even then thou shalt have nosuch dainties as Stone-face hath imagined for thee at the hands ofthe Wood-wight.'She laughed therewith, and he no less; and in sooth the meat was butsimple, of curds and new cheese, meat of the herdsmen.  But Face-of-god said gaily:  'Sweet it shall be to me; good is all that theFriend giveth.'Then she raised her hand and made the sign of the Hammer over theboard, and looked up at him and said:'Hath the Earth-god changed my face, Gold-mane, to what I verily am?'He held his face close to hers and looked into it, and him-seemed itwas as pure as the waters of a mountain lake, and as fine and well-wrought every deal of it as when his father had wrought in his stithymany days and fashioned a small piece of great mastery.  He wasashamed to kiss her again, but he said to himself, 'This is thefairest woman of the world, whom I have sworn to wed this year.'Then he spake aloud and said:'I see the face of the Friend, and it will not change to me.'Again she reddened a little, and the happy look in her face seemed togrow yet sweeter, and he was bewildered with longing and delight.But she stood up and went to an ambrye in the wall and brought fortha horn shod and lipped with silver of ancient fashion, and she pouredwine into it and held it forth and said:'O guest from the Dale, I pledge thee! and when thou hast drunk to mein turn we will talk of weighty matters.  For indeed I bear hopes inmy hands too heavy for the daughters of men to bear; and thou art achieftain's son, and mayst well help me to bear them; so let us talksimply and without guile, as folk that trust one another.'So she drank and held out the horn to him, and he took the horn andher hand both, and he kissed her hand and said:'Here in this Hall I drink to the Sons of the Wolf, whosoever theybe.'  Therewith he drank and he said:  'Simply and guilelessly indeedwill I talk with thee; for I am weary of lies, and for thy sake haveI told a many.''Thou shalt tell no more,' she said; 'and as for the health thou hastdrunk, it is good, and shall profit thee.  Now sit we here in theseancient seats and let us talk.'So they sat them down while the sun was westering in the Marchafternoon, and she said:'Tell me first what tidings have been in the Dale.'So he told her of the ransackings and of the murder at Carlstead.She said:  'These tidings have we heard before, and some deal of themwe know better than ye do, or can; for we were the ransackers ofPenny-thumb and Harts-bane.  Thereof will I say more presently.  Whatother tidings hast thou to tell of?  What oaths were sworn upon theBoar last Yule?'So he told her of the oath of Bristler the son of Brightling.  Shesmiled and said:  'He shall keep his oath, and yet redden no blade.'Then he told of his father's oath, and she said:'It is good; but even so would he do and no oath sworn.  All men maytrust Iron-face.  And thou, my friend, what oath didst thou swear?'His face grew somewhat troubled as he said:  'I swore to wed thefairest woman in the world, though the Dalesmen gainsaid me, and theybeyond the Dale.''Yea,' she said, 'and there is no need to ask thee whom thou didstmean by thy "fairest woman," for I have seen that thou deemest mefair enough.  My friend, maybe thy kindred will be against it, andthe kindred of the Bride; and it might be that my kindred would havegainsaid it if things were not as they are.  But though all mengainsay it, yet will not I.  It is meet and right that we twain wed.'She spake very soberly and quietly, but when she had spoken there wasnothing in his heart but joy and gladness:  yet shame of herloveliness refrained him, and he cast down his eyes before hers.Then she said in a kind voice:'I know thee, how glad thou art of this word of mine, because thoulookest on me with eyes of love, and thinkest of me as better than Iam; though I am no ill woman and no beguiler.  But this is not allthat I have to say to thee, though it be much; for there are morefolk in the world than thou and I only.  But I told thee this first,that thou mightest trust me in all things.  So, my friend, if thoucanst, refrain thy joy and thy longing a little, and hearken to whatconcerneth thee and me, and thy people and mine.''Fair woman and sweet friend,' he said, 'thou knowest of a gladnesswhich is hard to bear if one must lay it aside for a while; and of alonging which is hard to refrain if it mingle with another longing--knowest thou not?''Yea,' she said, 'I know it.''Yet,' said Face-of-god, 'I will forbear as thou biddest me.  Tellme, then, what were the felons who were slain at Carlstead?  Knowestthou of them?''Over well,' she said, 'they are our foes this many a year; and sincewe met last autumn they have become foes of you Dalesmen also.  Soonshall ye have tidings of them; and it was against them that I badethee arm yesterday.'Said Face-of-god:  'Is it against them that thou wouldst have us dobattle along with thy folk?''So it is,' she said; 'no other foemen have we.  And now, Gold-mane,thou art become a friend of the Wolf, and shalt before long be ofaffinity with our House; that other day thou didst ask me to tellthee of me and mine, and now will I do according to thine asking.Short shall my tale be; because maybe thou shalt hear it told again,and in goodly wise, before thine whole folk.'As thou wottest we be now outlaws and Wolves' Heads; and whiles welift the gear of men, but ever if we may of ill men and not of good;there is no worthy goodman of the Dale from whom we would take onehoof, or a skin of wine, or a cake of wax.'Wherefore are we outlaws?  Because we have been driven from our own,and we bore away our lives and our weapons, and little else; and forour lands, thou seest this Vale in the howling wilderness and hownarrow and poor it is, though it hath been the nurse of warriors intime past.'Hearken!  Time long ago came the kindred of the Wolf to theseMountains of the World; and they were in a pass in the stony maze andthe utter wilderness of the Mountains, and the foe was behind them innumbers not to be borne up against.  And so it befell that the passforked, and there were two ways before our Folk; and one part of themwould take the way to the north and the other the way to the south;and they could not agree which way the whole Folk should take.  Sothey sundered into two companies, and one took one way and oneanother.  Now as to those who fared by the southern road, we knew notwhat befell them, nor for long and long had we any tale of them.'But we who took the northern road, we happened on this Vale amidstthe wilderness, and we were weary of fleeing from the over-masteringfoe; and the dale seemed enough, and a refuge, and a place to dwellin, and no man was there before us, and few were like to find it, andwe were but a few.  So we dwelt here in this Vale for as wild as itis, the place where the sun shineth never in the winter, and scant isthe summer sunshine therein.  Here we raised a Doom-ring and buildedus a Hall, wherein thou now sittest beside me, O friend, and we dwelthere many seasons.'We had a few sheep in the wilderness, and a few neat fed down thegrass of the Vale; and we found gems and copper in the rocks about uswherewith at whiles to chaffer with the aliens, and fish we drew fromour river the Shivering Flood.  Also it is not to be hidden that inthose days we did not spare to lift the goods of men; yea, whileswould our warriors fare down unto the edges of the Plain and lie inwait there till the time served, and then drive the spoil from underthe very walls of the Cities.  Our men were not little-hearted, nordid our women lament the death of warriors over-much, for they werethere to bear more warriors to the Folk.'But the seasons passed, and the Folk multiplied in Shadowy Vale, andlivelihood seemed like to fail them, and needs must they seek widerlands.  So by ways which thou wilt one day wot of, we came into avalley that lieth north-west of Shadowy Vale:  a land like thine ofBurgdale, or better; wide it was, plenteous of grass and trees, wellwatered, full of all things that man can desire.'Were there men before us in this Dale? sayest thou.  Yea, but notvery many, and they feeble in battle, weak of heart, though strong ofbody.  These, when they saw the Sons of the Wolf with weapons intheir hands, felt themselves puny before us, and their hearts failedthem; and they came to us with gifts, and offered to share the Dalebetween them and us, for they said there was enough for both folks.So we took their offer and became their friends; and some of ourHouses wedded wives of the strangers, and gave them their women towife.  Therein they did amiss; for the blended Folk as thegenerations passed became softer than our blood, and many wereuntrusty and greedy and tyrannous, and the days of the whoredom fellupon us, and when we deemed ourselves the mightiest then were we thenearest to our fall.  But the House whereof I am would never wed withthese Westlanders, and other Houses there were who had affinity withus who chiefly wedded with us of the Wolf, and their fathers had comewith ours into that fruitful Dale; and these were called the RedHand, and the Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the RaggedSword.  Thou hast heard those names once before, friend?''Yea,' he said, and as he spoke the picture of that other day cameback to him, and he called to mind all that he had said, and hishappiness of that hour seemed the more and the sweeter for thatmemory.She went on:  'Fair and goodly is that Dale as mine own eyes haveseen, and plentiful of all things, and up in its mountains to theeast are caves and pits whence silver is digged abundantly; thereforeis the Dale called Silver-dale.  Hast thou heard thereof, my friend?''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'though I have marvelled whence ye gat suchfoison of silver.'He looked on her and marvelled, for now she seemed as if it wereanother woman:  her eyes were gleaming bright, her lips were parted;there was a bright red flush on the pommels of her two cheeks as shespake again and said:'Happy lived the Folk in Silver-dale for many and many winters andsummers:  the seasons were good and no lack was there:  littlesickness there was and less war, and all seemed better than well.  Itis strange that ye Dalesmen have not heard of Silver-dale.''Nay,' said he, 'but I have not; of Rose-dale have I heard, as a landvery far away:  but no further do we know of toward that airt.  LiethSilver-dale anywhere nigh to Rose-dale?'She said:  'It is the next dale to it, yet is it a far journeybetwixt the two, for the ice-sea pusheth a horn in betwixt them; andeven below the ice the mountain-neck is passable to none save a boldcrag-climber, and to him only bearing his life in his hands.  But, myfriend, I am but lingering over my tale, because it grieveth me soreto have to tell it.  Hearken then!  In the days when I had seen butten summers, and my brother was a very young man, but exceedingstrong, and as beautiful as thou art now, war fell on us withoutrumour or warning; for there swarmed into Silver-dale, though not bythe ways whereby we had entered it, a host of aliens, short ofstature, crooked of limb, foul of aspect, but fierce warriors andarmed full well:  they were men having no country to go back to,though they had no women or children with them, as we had when wewere young in these lands, but used all women whom they took as theirbeastly lust bade them, making them their thralls if they slew themnot.  Soon we found that these foemen asked no more of us than all wehad, and therewithal our lives to be cast away or used for theirservice as beasts of burden or pleasure.  There then we gathered ourfighting-men and withstood them; and if we had been all of thekindreds of the Wolf and the fruit of the wives of warriors, weshould have driven back these felons and saved the Dale, though itmaybe more than half ruined:  but the most part of us were of thatmingled blood, or of the generations of the Dalesmen whom we hadconquered long ago, and stout as they were of body their heartsfailed them, and they gave themselves up to the aliens to be as theiroxen and asses.'Why make a long tale of it?  We who were left, and could brook deathbut not thraldom, fought it out together, women as well as men, tillthe sweetness of life and a happy chance for escape bid us flee,vanquished but free men.  For at the end of three days' fight we hadbeen driven up to the easternmost end of the Dale, and up anigh tothe jaws of the pass whereby the Folk had first come into Silver-dale, and we had those with us who knew every cranny of that way,while to strangers who knew it not it was utterly impassable; nightwas coming on also, and even those murder-carles were weary withslaying; and, moreover, on this last day, when they saw that they hadwon all, they were fighting to keep, and not to slay, and a fewstubborn carles and queens, of what use would they be, or where wasthe gain of risking life to win them?'So they forbore us, and night came on moonless and dark; and it wasthe early spring season, when the days are not yet long, and so bynight and cloud we fled away, and back again to Shadowy Vale.'Forsooth, we were but a few; for when we were gotten into this Vale,this strip of grass and water in the wilderness, and had told up ourcompany, we were but two hundred and thirty and five of men and womenand children.  For there were an hundred and thirty and three grownmen of all ages, and of women grown seventy and five, and one scoreand seven children, whereof I was one; for, as thou mayst deem, itwas easier for grown men with weapons in their hands to escape fromthat slaughter than for women and children.'There sat we in yonder Doom-ring and took counsel, and to some itseemed good that we should all dwell together in Shadowy Vale, andbeset the skirts of the foemen till the days should better; butothers deemed that there was little avail therein; and there was amighty man of the kindred, Stone-wolf by name, a man of middle-age,and he said, that late in life had he tasted of war, and though thebanquet was made bitter with defeat, yet did the meat seem wholesometo him.  "Come down with me to the Cities of the Plain," said he,"all you who are stout warriors; and leave we here the old men andthe swains and the women and children.  Hateful are the folk there,and full of malice, but soft withal and dastardly.  Let us go downthither and make ourselves strong amongst them, and sell our valourfor their wealth till we come to rule them, and they make us theirkings, and we establish the Folk of the Wolf amongst the aliens; thenwill we come back hither and bring away that which we have left."'So he spake, and the more part of the warriors yea said his rede,and they went with him to the Westland, and amongst these was mybrother Folk-might (for that is his name in the kindred).  And Isorrowed at his departure, for he had borne me thither out of theflames and the clash of swords and the press of battle, and to me hadhe ever been kind and loving, albeit he hath had the Words of hardand froward used on him full oft.'So in this Vale abode we that were left, and the seasons passed;some of the elders died, and some of the children also; but morechildren were born, for amongst us were men and women to whom it waslawful to wed with each other.  Even with this scanty remnant wasleft some of the life of the kindred of old days; and after we hadbeen here but a little while, the young men, yea and the old also,and even some of the women, would steal through passes that we, andwe only, knew of, and would fall upon the Aliens in Silver-dale asoccasion served, and lift their goods both live and dead; and thisbecame both a craft and a pastime amongst us.  Nor may I hide that wesometimes went lifting otherwhere; for in the summer and autumn wewould fare west a little and abide in the woods the season through,and hunt the deer thereof, and whiles would we drive the spoil fromthe scattered folk not far from your Shepherd-Folk; but with theShepherds themselves and with you Dalesmen we meddled not.'Now that little wood-lawn with the toft of an ancient dwelling init, wherein, saith Bow-may, thou didst once rest, was one of oursummer abodes; and later on we built the hall under the pine-woodthat thou knowest.'Thus then grew up our young men; and our maids were little softer;e'en such as Bow-may is (and kind is she withal), and it seemed invery sooth as if the Spirit of the Wolf was with us, and theroughness of the Waste made us fierce; and law we had not and heedednot, though love was amongst us.'She stopped awhile and fell a-musing, and her face softened, and sheturned to him with that sweet happy look upon it and said:'Desolate and dreary is the Dale, thou deemest, friend; and yet forme I love it and its dark-green water, and it is to me as if theFathers of the kindred visit it and hold converse with us; and thereI grew up when I was little, before I knew what a woman was, andstrange communings had I with the wilderness.  Friend, when we arewedded, and thou art a great chieftain, as thou wilt be, I shall askof thee the boon to suffer me to abide here at whiles that I mayremember the days when I was little and the love of the kindred waxedin me.''This is but a little thing to ask,' said Face-of-god; 'I would thouhadst asked me more.''Fear not,' she said, 'I shall ask thee for much and many things; andsome of them belike thou shalt deny me.'He shook his head; but she smiled in his face and said:'Yea, so it is, friend; but hearken.  The seasons passed, and sixyears wore, and I was grown a tall slim maiden, fleet of foot andable to endure toil enough, though I never bore weapons, nor havedone.  So on a fair even of midsummer when we were together, the mostof us, round about this Hall and the Doom-ring, we saw a tall man inbright war-gear come forth into the Dale by the path that thoucamest, and then another and another till there were two score andseven men-at-arms standing on the grass below the scree yonder; bythat time had we gotten some weapons in our hands, and we stoodtogether to meet the new-comers, but they drew no sword and notchedno shaft, but came towards us laughing and joyous, and lo! it was mybrother Folk-might and his men, those that were left of them, comeback to us from the Westland.'Glad indeed was I to behold him; and for him when he had taken me inhis arms and looked up and down the Dale, he cried out:  'In manyfair places and many rich dwellings have I been; but this is the hourthat I have looked for.''Now when we asked him concerning Stone-wolf and the others who weremissing (for ten tens of stalwarth men had fared to the Westland), heswept out his hand toward the west and said with a solemn face:"There they lie, and grass groweth over their bones, and we who havecome aback, and ye who have abided, these are now the children of theWolf:  there are no more now on the earth."'Let be!  It was a fair even and high was the feast in the Hall thatnight, and sweet was the converse with our folk come back.  A gladman was my brother Folk-might when he heard that for years past wehad been lifting the gear of men, and chiefly of the Aliens inSilver-dale:  and he himself was become learned in war and a deftleader of men.'So the days passed and the seasons, and we lived on as we might; butwith Folk-might's return there began to grow up in all our heartswhat had long been flourishing in mine, and that was the hope of oneday winning back our own again, and dying amidst the dear groves ofSilver-dale.  Within these years we had increased somewhat in number;for if we had lost those warriors in the Westland, and some old menwho had died in the Dale, yet our children had grown up (I have nowseen twenty and one summers) and more were growing up.  Moreover,after the first year, from the time when we began to fall upon theDusky Men of Silver-dale, from time to time they who went on suchadventures set free such thralls of our blood as they could fall inwith and whom they could trust in, and they dwelt (and yet dwell)with us in the Dale:  first and last we have taken in three score andtwelve of such men, and a score of women-thralls withal.'Now during these seasons, and not very long ago, after I was a womangrown, the thought came to me, and to Folk-might also, that therewere kindreds of the people dwelling anear us whom we might so dealwith that they should become our friends and brothers in arms, andthat through them we might win back Silver-dale.'Of Rose-dale we wotted already that the Folk were nought of ourblood, feeble in the field, cowed by the Dusky Men, and at last madethralls to them; so nought was to do there.  But Folk-might went toand fro to gather tidings:  at whiles I with him, at whiles one ormore of Wood-father's children, who with their father and mother andBow-may have abided in the Vale ever since the Great Undoing.'Soon he fell in with thy Folk, and first of all with theWoodlanders, and that was a joy to him; for wot ye what?  He got toknow that these men were the children of those of our Folk who hadsundered from us in the mountain passes time long and long ago; andhe loved them, for he saw that they were hardy and trusty, andwarriors at heart.'Then he went amongst the Shepherd-Folk, and he deemed them good meneasily stirred, and deemed that they might soon be won to friendship;and he knew that they were mostly come from the Houses of theWoodlanders, so that they also were of the kindred.'And last he came into Burgdale, and found there a merry and happyFolk, little wont to war, but stout-hearted, and nowise puny eitherof body or soul; he went there often and learned much about them, anddeemed that they would not be hard to win to fellowship.  And hefound that the House of the Face was the chiefest house there; andthat the Alderman and his sons were well beloved of all the folk, andthat they were the men to be won first, since through them should allothers be won.  I also went to Burgstead with him twice, as I toldthee erst; and I saw thee, and I deemed that thou wouldest lightlybecome our friend; and it came into my mind that I myself might wedthee, and that the House of the Face thereby might have affinitythenceforth with the Children of the Wolf.'He said:  'Why didst thou deem thus of me, O friend?'She laughed and said:  'Dost thou long to hear me say the words whenthou knowest my thought well?  So be it.  I saw thee both young andfair; and I knew thee to be the son of a noble, worthy, guileless manand of a beauteous woman of great wits and good rede.  And I foundthee to be kind and open-handed and simple like thy father, and likethy mother wiser than thou thyself knew of thyself; and that thouwert desirous of deeds and fain of women.'She was silent for a while, and he also:  then he said:  'Didst thoudraw me to the woods and to thee?'She reddened and said:  'I am no spell-wife:  but true it is thatWood-mother made a waxen image of thee, and thrust through the heartthereof the pin of my girdle-buckle, and stroked it every morningwith an oak-bough over which she had sung spells.  But dost thou notremember, Gold-mane, how that one day last Hay-month, as ye wereresting in the meadows in the cool of the evening, there came to youa minstrel that played to you on the fiddle, and therewith sang asong that melted all your hearts, and that this song told of theWild-wood, and what was therein of desire and peril and beguiling anddeath, and love unto Death itself?  Dost thou remember, friend?''Yea,' he said, 'and how when the minstrel was done Stone-face fellto telling us more tales yet of the woodland, and the minstrel sangagain and yet again, till his tales had entered into my very heart.''Yea,' she said, 'and that minstrel was Wood-wont; and I sent him tosing to thee and thine, deeming that if thou didst hearken, thouwould'st seek the woodland and happen upon us.'He laughed and said:  'Thou didst not doubt but that if we met, thoumightest do with me as thou wouldest?''So it is,' she said, 'that I doubted it little.''Therein wert thou wise,' said Face-of-god; 'but now that we aretalking without guile to each other, mightest thou tell me whereforeit was that Folk-might made that onslaught upon me?  For certain itis that he was minded to slay me.'She said:  'It was sooth what I told thee, that whiles he groweth sobattle-eager that whatso edge-tool he beareth must needs come out ofthe scabbard; but there was more in it than that, which I could nottell thee erst.  Two days before thy coming he had been down toBurgstead in the guise of an old carle such as thou sawest him withme in the market-place.  There was he guested in your Hall, and oncemore saw thee and the Bride together; and he saw the eyes of lovewherewith she looked on thee (for so much he told me), and deemedthat thou didst take her love but lightly.  And he himself looked onher with such love (and this he told me not) that he deemed noughtgood enough for her, and would have had thee give thyself up whollyto her; for my brother is a generous man, my friend.  So when I toldhim on the morn of that day whereon we met that we looked to see theethat eve (for indeed I am somewhat foreseeing), he said:  "Look thou,Sun-beam, if he cometh, it is not unlike that I shall drive a spearthrough him."  "Wherefore?" said I; "can he serve our turn when he isdead?"  Said he:  "I care little.  Mine own turn will I serve.  Thousayest WHEREFORE?  I tell thee this stripling beguileth to hertorment the fairest woman that is in the world--such an one as ismeet to be the mother of chieftains, and to stand by warriors intheir day of peril.  I have seen her; and thus have I seen her."Then said I:  "Greatly forsooth shalt thou pleasure her by slayinghim!"  And he answered:  "I shall pleasure myself.  And one day sheshall thank me, when she taketh my hand in hers and we go together tothe Bride-bed."  Therewith came over me a clear foresight of thehours to come, and I said to him:  "Yea, Folk-might, cast the spearand draw the sword; but him thou shalt not slay:  and thou shalt oneday see him standing with us before the shafts of the Dusky Men."  SoI spake; but he looked fiercely at me, and departed and shunned meall that day, and by good hap I was hard at hand when thou drewestnigh our abode.  Nay, Gold-mane, what would'st thou with thy sword?Why art thou so red and wrathful?  Would'st thou fight with mybrother because he loveth thy friend, thine old playmate, thykinswoman, and thinketh pity of her sorrow?'He said, with knit brow and gleaming eyes:  'Would the man take heraway from me perforce?''My friend,' she said, 'thou art not yet so wise as not to be a foolat whiles.  Is it not so that she herself hath taken herself fromthee, since she hath come to know that thou hast given thyself toanother?  Hath she noted nought of thee this winter and spring?  Isshe well pleased with the ways of thee?'He said:  'Thou hast spoken simply with me, and I will do no lesswith thee.  It was but four days agone that she did me to wit thatshe knew of me how I sought my love on the Mountain; and she put meto sore shame, and afterwards I wept for her sorrow.'Therewith he told her all that the Bride had said to him, as he wellmight, for he had forgotten no word of it.Then said the Friend:  'She shall have the token that she craveth,and it is I that shall give it to her.'Therewith she took from her finger a ring wherein was set a very fairchangeful mountain-stone, and gave it to him, and said:'Thou shalt give her this and tell her whence thou hadst it; and tellher that I bid her remember that To-morrow is a new day.'CHAPTER XX.  THOSE TWO TOGETHER HOLD THE RING OF THE EARTH-GODAnd now they fell silent both of them, and sat hearkening the soundsof the Dale, from the whistle of the plover down by the water-side tothe far-off voices of the children and maidens about the kine in thelower meadows.  At last Gold-mane took up the word and said:'Sweet friend, tell me the uttermost of what thou would'st have ofme.  Is it not that I should stand by thee and thine in the Folk-moteof the Dalesmen, and speak for you when ye pray us for help againstyour foemen; and then again that I do my best when ye and we arearrayed for battle against the Dusky Men?  This is easy to do, andgreat is the reward thou offerest me.''I look for this service of thee,' she said, 'and none other.''And when I go down to the battle,' said he, 'shalt thou be sorry forour sundering?'She said:  'There shall be no sundering; I shall wend with thee.'Said he:  'And if I were slain in the battle, would'st thou lamentme?''Thou shalt not be slain,' she said.Again was there silence betwixt them, till at last he said:'This then is why thou didst draw me to thee in the Wild-wood?''Yea,' said she.Again for a while no word was spoken, and Face-of-god looked on hertill she cast her eyes down before him.Then at last he spake, and the colour came and went in his face as hesaid:  'Tell me thy name what it is.'She said:  'I am called the Sun-beam.'Then he said, and his voice trembled therewith:  'O Sun-beam, I havebeen seeking pleasant and cunning words, and can find none such.  Buttell me this if thou wilt:  dost thou desire me as I desire thee? oris it that thou wilt suffer me to wed thee and bed thee at last asmere payment for the help that I shall give to thee and thine?  Nay,doubt it not that I will take the payment, if this is what thou wiltgive me and nought else.  Yet tell me.'Her face grew troubled, and she said:'Gold-mane, maybe that thou hast now asked me one question too many;for this is no fair game to be played between us.  For thee, as Ideem, there are this day but two people in the world, and that isthou and I, and the earth is for us two alone.  But, my friend,though I have seen but twenty and one summers, it is nowise so withme, and to me there are many in the world; and chiefly the Folk ofthe Wolf, amidst whose very heart I have grown up.  Moreover, I canthink of her whom I have supplanted, the Bride to wit; and I knowher, and how bitter and empty her days shall be for a while, and howvain all our redes for her shall seem to her.  Yea, I know hersorrow, and see it and grieve for it:  so canst not thou, unless thouverily see her before thee, her face unhappy, and her voice changedand hard.  Well, I will tell thee what thou askest.  When I drew theeto me on the Mountain I thought but of the friendship and brotherhoodto be knitted up between our two Folks, nor did I anywise desire thylove of a young man.  But when I saw thee on the heath and in theHall that day, it pleased me to think that a man so fair andchieftain-like should one day lie by my side; and again when I sawthat the love of me had taken hold of thee, I would not have theegrieved because of me, but would have thee happy.  And now what shallI say?--I know not; I cannot tell.  Yet am I the Friend, as erst Icalled myself.'And, Gold-mane, I have seen hitherto but the outward show and imageof thee, and though that be goodly, how would it be if thou didstshame me with little-heartedness and evil deeds?  Let me see thee inthe Folk-mote and the battle, and then may I answer thee.'Then she held her peace, and he answered nothing; and she turned herface from him and said:'Out on it! have I beguiled myself as well as thee?  These are butempty words I have been saying.  If thou wilt drag the truth out ofme, this is the very truth:  that to-day is happy to me as it is tothee, and that I have longed sore for its coming.  O Gold-mane, Ospeech-friend, if thou wert to pray me or command me that I lie inthine arms to-night, I should know not how to gainsay thee.  Yet Ibeseech thee to forbear, lest thy death and mine come of it.  And whyshould we die, O friend, when we are so young, and the world lies sofair before us, and the happy days are at hand when the Children ofthe Wolf and the kindreds of the Dale shall deliver the Folk, and alldays shall be good and all years?'They had both risen up as she spake, and now he put forth his handsto her and took her in his arms, wondering the while, as he drew herto him, how much slenderer and smaller and weaker she seemed in hisembrace than he had thought of her; and when their lips met, he feltthat she kissed him as he her.  Then he held her by the shoulders atarms' length from him, and beheld her face how her eyes were closedand her lips quivering.  But before him, in a moment of time, passeda picture of the life to be in the fair Dale, and all she would givehim there, and the days good and lovely from morn to eve and eve tomorn; and though in that moment it was hard for him to speak, at lasthe spoke in a voice hoarse at first, and said:'Thou sayest sooth, O friend; we will not die, but live; I will notdrag our deaths upon us both, nor put a sword in the hands of Folk-might, who loves me not.'Then he kissed her on the brow and said:  'Now shalt thou take me bythe hand and lead me forth from the Hall.  For the day is waxing old,and here meseemeth in this dim hall there are words crossing in theair about us--words spoken in days long ago, and tales of old time,that keep egging me on to do my will and die, because that is allthat the world hath for a valiant man; and to such words I would nothearken, for in this hour I have no will to die, nor can I think ofdeath.'She took his hand and led him forth without more words, and they wenthand in hand and paced slowly round the Doom-ring, the light airbreathing upon them till their faces were as calm and quiet as theirwont was, and hers especially as bright and happy as when he hadfirst seen her that day.The sun was sinking now, and only sent one golden ray into the valleythrough a cleft in the western rock-wall, but the sky overhead wasbright and clear; from the meadows came the sound of the lowing ofkine and the voices of children a-sporting, and it seemed to Gold-mane that they were drawing nigher, both the children and the kine,and somewhat he begrudged it that he should not be alone with theFriend.Now when they had made half the circuit of the Doom-ring, the Sun-beam stopped him, and then led him through the Ring of Stones, andbrought him up to the altar which was amidst of it; and the altar wasa great black stone hewn smooth and clean, and with the image of theWolf carven on the front thereof; and on its face lay the gold ringwhich the priest or captain of the Folk bore on his arm between theGod and the people at all folk-motes.So she said:  'This is the altar of the God of Earth, and often hathit been reddened by mighty men; and thereon lieth the Ring of theSons of the Wolf; and now it were well that we swore troth on thatring before my brother cometh; for now will he soon be here.'Then Gold-mane took the Ring and thrust his right hand through it,and took her right hand in his; so that the Ring lay on both theirhands, and therewith he spake aloud:'I am Face-of-god of the House of the Face, and I do thee to wit, OGod of the Earth, that I pledge my troth to this woman, the Sun-beamof the Kindred of the Wolf, to beget my offspring on her, and to livewith her, and to die with her:  so help me, thou God of the Earth,and the Warrior and the God of the Face!'Then spake the Sun-beam:  'I, the Sun-beam of the Children of theWolf, pledge my troth to Face-of-god to lie in his bed and to bearhis children and none other's, and to be his speech-friend till Idie:  so help me the Wolf and the Warrior and the God of the Earth!'Then they laid the Ring on the altar again, and they kissed eachother long and sweetly, and then turned away from the altar anddeparted from the Doom-ring, going hand in hand together down themeadow, and as they went, the noise of the kine and the children grewnearer and nearer, and presently came the whole company of them rounda ness of the rock-wall; there were some thirty little lads andlasses driving on the milch-kine, with half a score of older maidsand grown women, one of whom was Bow-may, who was lightly andscantily clad, as one who heeds not the weather, or deems all monthsmidsummer.The children came running up merrily when they saw the Sun-beam, butstopped short shyly when they noted the tall fair stranger with her.They were all strong and sturdy children, and some very fair, butbrown with the weather, if not with the sun.  Bow-may came up toGold-mane and took his hand and greeted him kindly and said:'So here thou art at last in Shadowy Vale; and I hope that thou artcontent therewith, and as happy as I would wish thee to be.  Well,this is the first time; and when thou comest the second time it maywell be that the world shall be growing better.'She held the distaff which she bore in her hand (for she had beenspinning) as if it were a spear; her limbs were goodly and shapely,and she trod the thick grass of the Vale with a kind of waryfirmness, as though foemen might be lurking nearby.  The Sun-beamsmiled upon her kindly and said:'That shall not fail to be, Bow-may:  ye have won a new friend to-day.  But tell me, when dost thou look to see the men here, for I wasdown by the water when they went away yesterday?''They shall come into the Dale a little after sunset,' said Bow-may.'Shall I abide them, my friend?' said Gold-mane, turning to the Sun-beam.'Yea,' she said; 'for what else art thou come hither? or art thou sopressed to depart from us?  Last time we met thou wert not so hastyto sunder.'They smiled on each other; and Bow-may looked on them and laughedoutright; then a flush showed in her cheeks through the tan of them,and she turned toward the children and the other women who werebusied about the milking of the kine.But those two sat down together on a bank amidst the plain meadow,facing the river and the eastern rock-wall, and the Sun-beam said:'I am fain to speak to thee and to see thine eyes watching me while Ispeak; and now, my friend, I will tell thee something unasked whichhas to do with what e'en now thou didst ask me; for I would have theetrust me wholly, and know me for what I am.  Time was I schemed andplanned for this day of betrothal; but now I tell thee it has becomeno longer needful for bringing to pass our fellowship in arms withthy people.  Yea yesterday, ere he went on a hunt, whereof he shalltell thee, Folk-might was against it, in words at least; and yet asone who would have it done if he might have no part in it.  So, ingood sooth, this hand that lieth in thine is the hand of a wilfulwoman, who desireth a man, and would keep him for her speech-friend.Now art thou fond and happy; yet bear in mind that there are deeds tobe done, and the troth we have just plighted must be paid for.  Sohearken, I bid thee.  Dost thou care to know why the wheedling ofthee is no longer needful to us?'He said:  'A little while ago I should have said, Yea, If thy lipssay the words.  But now, O friend, it seemeth as if thine heart werealready become a part of mine, and I feel as if the chieftain weregrowing up in me and the longing for deeds:  so I say, Tell me, for Iwere fain to hear what toucheth the welfare of thy Folk and theirfellowship with my Folk; for on that also have I set my heart?'She said gravely and with solemn eyes:'What thou sayest is good:  full glad am I that I have not plightedmy troth to a mere goodly lad, but rather to a chieftain and awarrior.  Now then hearken!  Since I saw thee first in the autumnthis hath happened, that the Dusky Men, increasing both in numbersand insolence, have it in their hearts to win more than Silver-dale,and it is years since they have fallen upon Rose-dale and conqueredit, rather by murder than by battle, and made all men thralls there,for feeble were the Folk thereof; and doubt it not but that they willlook into Burgdale before long.  They are already abroad in thewoods, and were it not for the fear of the Wolf they would be thickertherein, and faring wider; for we have slain many of them, comingupon them unawares; and they know not where we dwell, nor who we be:so they fear to spread about over-much and pry into unknown placeslest the Wolf howl on them.  Yet beware! for they will gather innumbers that we may not meet, and then will they swarm into the Dale;and if ye would live your happy life that ye love so well, ye mustnow fight for it; and in that battle must ye needs join yourselves tous, that we may help each other.  Herein have ye nought to choose,for now with you it is no longer a thing to talk of whether ye willhelp certain strangers and guests and thereby win some gain toyourselves, but whether ye have the hearts to fight for yourselves,and the wits to be the fellows of tall men and stout warriors whohave pledged their lives to win or die for it.'She was silent a little and then turned and looked fondly on Face-of-god and said:'Therefore, Gold-mane, we need thee no longer; for thou must needsfight in our battle.  I have no longer aught to do to wheedle thee tolove me.  Yet if thou wilt love me, then am I a glad woman.'He said:  'Thou wottest well that thou hast all my love, neither willI fail thee in the battle.  I am not little-hearted, though I wouldhave given myself to thee for no reward.''It is well,' said the Sun-beam; 'nought is undone by that which Ihave done.  Moreover, it is good that we have plighted troth to-day.For Folk-might will presently hear thereof, and he must needs abidethe thing which is done.  Hearken! he cometh.'For as she spoke there came a glad cry from the women and children,and those two stood up and turned toward the west and beheld thewarriors of the Wolf coming down into the Dale by the way that Gold-mane had come.'Come,' said the Sun-beam, 'here are your brethren in arms, let us gogreet them; they will rejoice in thee.'So they went thither, and there stood eighty and seven men on thegrass below the scree and Folk-might their captain; and besides somevaliant women, and a few carles who were on watch on the waste, and ahalf score who had been left in the Dale, these were all the warriorsof the Wolf.  They were clad in no holiday raiment, not even Folk-might, but were in sheep-brown gear of the coarsest, like tohusbandmen late come from the plough, but armed well and goodly.But when the twain drew near, the men clashed their spears on theirshields, and cried out for joy of them, for they all knew what Face-of-god's presence there betokened of fellowship with the kindreds;but Folk-might came forward and took Face-of-god's hand and greetedhim and said:'Hail, son of the Alderman!  Here hast thou come into the ancientabode of chieftains and warriors, and belike deeds await thee also.'Yet his brow was knitted as he said these words, and he spake slowly,as one that constraineth himself; but presently his face clearedsomewhat and he said:'Dalesman, it behoveth thy people to bestir them if ye would live andsee good days.  Hath my sister told thee what is toward?  Or whatsayest thou?''Hail to thee, son of the Wolf!' said Face-of-god.  'Thy sister hathtold me all; and even if these Dusky Felons were not our foe-menalso, yet could I have my way, we should have given thee all help,and should have brought back peace and good days to thy folk.'Then Folk-might flushed red and spake, as he cast out his handtowards the warriors and up and down toward the Dale:'These be my folk, and these only:  and as to peace, only those of usknow of it who are old men.  Yet is it well; and if we and yetogether be strong enough to bring back good days to the feeble menwhom the Dusky Ones torment in Silver-dale it shall be better yet.'Then he turned about to his sister, and looked keenly into her eyestill she reddened, and took her hand and looked at the wrist andsaid:'O sister, see I not the mark on thy wrist of the Ring of the God ofthe Earth?  Have not oaths been sworn since yesterday?''True it is,' she said, 'that this man and I have plighted trothtogether at the altar of the Doom-ring.'Said Folk-might:  'Thou wilt have thy will, and I may not amend it.'Therewith he turned about to Face-of-god and said:'Thou must look to it to keep this oath, whatever other one thou hastfailed in.'Said Face-of-god somewhat wrathfully:  'I shall keep it, whether thoubiddest me to keep it or break it.''That is well,' said Folk-might, 'and then for all that hath gonebefore thou mayest in a manner pay, if thou art dauntless before thefoe.''I look to be no blencher in the battle,' said Face-of-god; 'that isnot the fashion of our kindred, whosoever may be before us.  Yea, andeven were it thy blade, O mighty warrior of the Wolf, I would do mybest to meet it in manly fashion.'As he spake he half drew forth Dale-warden from his sheath, lookingsteadily into the eyes of Folk-might; and the Sun-beam looked uponhim happily.  But Folk-might laughed and said:'Thy sword is good, and I deem that thine heart will not fail thee;but it is by my side and not in face of me that thou shalt redden thegood blade:  I see not the day when we twain shall hew at eachother.'Then in a while he spake again:'Thou must pardon us if our words are rough; for we have stood inrough places, where we had to speak both short and loud, whereasthere was much to do.  But now will we twain talk of matters thatconcern chieftains who are going on a hard adventure.  And ye women,do ye dight the Hall for the evening feast, which shall be the feastof the troth-plight for you twain.  This indeed we owe thee, O guest;for little shall be thine heritage which thou shalt have with mysister, over and above that thy sword winneth for thee.'But the Sun-beam said:  'Hast thou any to-night?''Yea,' he said; 'Spear-god, how many was it?'There came forward a tall man bearing an axe in his right hand, andcarrying over his shoulder by his left hand a bundle of silver arm-rings just such as Gold-mane had seen on the felons who were slain byWood-grey's house.  The carle cast them on the ground and then kneltdown and fell to telling them over; and then looked up and said:'Twelve yesterday in the wood where the battle was going on; and thismorning seven by the tarn in the pine-wood and six near this easternedge of the wood:  one score and five all told.  But, Folk-might,they are coming nigh to Shadowy Vale.''Sooth is that,' said Folk-might; 'but it shall be looked to.  Comenow apart with me, Face-of-god.'So the others went their ways toward the Hall, while Folk-might ledthe Burgdaler to a sheltered nook under the sheer rocks, and therethey sat down to talk, and Folk-might asked Gold-mane closely of themuster of the Dalesmen and the Shepherds and the Woodland Caries, andhe was well pleased when Face-of-god told him of how many could marchto a stricken field, and of their archery, and of their weapons andtheir goodness.All this took some time in the telling, and now night was coming onapace, and Folk-might said:'Now will it be time to go to the Hall; but keep in thy mind thatthese Dusky Men will overrun you unless ye deal with them betimes.These are of the kind that ye must cast fear into their hearts byfalling on them; for if ye abide till they fall upon you, they arelike the winter wolves that swarm on and on, how many soever ye slay.And this above all things shall help you, that we shall bring youwhereas ye shall fall on them unawares and destroy them as boys dowith a wasp's nest.  Yet shall many a mother's son bite the dust.'Is it not so that in four weeks' time is your spring-feast andmarket at Burgstead, and thereafter the great Folk-mote?''So it is,' said Gold-mane.'Thither shall I come then,' said Folk-might, 'and give myself outfor the slayer of Rusty and the ransacker of Harts-bane and Penny-thumb; and therefor shall I offer good blood-wite and theft-wite; andthy father shall take that; for he is a just man.  Then shall I tellmy tale.  Yet it may be thou shalt see us before if battle betide.And now fair befall this new year; for soon shall the scabbards beempty and the white swords be dancing in the air, and spears and axesshall be the growth of this spring-tide.'And he leaped up from his seat and walked to and fro before Gold-mane, and now was it grown quite dark.  Then Folk-might turned toFace-of-god and said:'Come, guest, the windows of the Hall are yellow; let us to thefeast.  To-morrow shalt thou get thee to the beginning of this work.I hope of thee that thou art a good sword; else have I done a follyand my sister a worse one.  But now forget that, and feast.'Gold-mane arose, not very well at ease, for the man seemedoverbearing; yet how might he fall upon the Sun-beam's kindred, andthe captain of these new brethren in arms?  So he spake not.  ButFolk-might said to him:'Yet I would not have thee forget that I was wroth with thee when Isaw thee to-day; and had it not been for the coming battle I haddrawn sword upon thee.'Then Face-of-god's wrath was stirred, and he said:'There is yet time for that! but why art thou wroth with me?  And Ishall tell thee that there is little manliness in thy chiding.  Forhow may I fight with thee, thou the brother of my plighted speech-friend and my captain in this battle?''Therein thou sayest sooth,' said Folk-might; 'but hard it was to seeyou two standing together; and thou canst not give the Bride to me asI give my sister to thee.  For I have seen her, and I have seen herlooking at thee; and I know that she will not have it so.'Then they went on together toward the Hall, and Face-of-god wassilent and somewhat troubled; and as they drew near to the Hall,Folk-might spake again:'Yet time may amend it; and if not, there is the battle, and maybethe end.  Now be we merry!'So they went into the Hall together, and there was the Sun-beamgloriously arrayed, as erst in the woodland bower, and Face-of-godsat on the dais beside her, and the uttermost sweetness of desireentered into his soul as he noted her eyes and her mouth, that weregrown so kind to him, and her hand that strayed toward his.The Hall was full of folk, and all those warriors were there withWood-father and his sons, and Wood-mother, and Bow-may and many otherwomen; and Gold-mane looked down the Hall and deemed that he hadnever seen such stalwarth bodies of men, or so bold and meet forbattle:  as for the women he had seen fairer in Burgdale, but thesewere fair of their own fashion, shapely and well-knit, and strong-armed and large-limbed, yet sweet-voiced and gentle withal.  Nay, thevery lads of fifteen winters or so, whereof a few were there, seemedbold and bright-eyed and keen of wit, and it seemed like that if thewarriors fared afield these would be with them.So wore the feast; and Folk-might as aforetime amongst the healthscalled on men to drink to the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, andthe Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword.  But nowhad Face-of-god no need to ask what these meant, since he knew thatthey were the names of the kindreds of the Wolf.  They drank also tothe troth-plight and to those twain, and shouted aloud over thehealth and clashed their weapons:  and Gold-mane wondered what echoof that shout would reach to Burgstead.Then sang men songs of old time, and amongst them Wood-wont stoodwith his fiddle amidst the Hall and Bow-may beside him, and they sangin turn to it sweetly and clearly; and this is some of what theysang:She singeth.Wild is the waste and long leagues over;   Whither then wend ye spear and sword,Where nought shall see your helms but the plover,   Far and far from the dear Dale's sward?He singeth.Many a league shall we wend together   With helm and spear and bended bow.Hark! how the wind blows up for weather:   Dark shall the night be whither we go.Dark shall the night be round the byre,   And dark as we drive the brindled kine;Dark and dark round the beacon-fire,   Dark down in the pass round our wavering line.Turn on thy path, O fair-foot maiden,   And come our ways by the pathless road;Look how the clouds hang low and laden   Over the walls of the old abode!She singeth.Bare are my feet for the rough waste's wending,   Wild is the wind, and my kirtle's thin;Faint shall I be ere the long way's ending   Drops down to the Dale and the grief therein.He singeth.Do on the brogues of the wild-wood rover,   Do on the byrnies' ring-close mail;Take thou the staff that the barbs hang over,   O'er the wind and the waste and the way to prevail.Come, for how from thee shall I sunder?   Come, that a tale may arise in the land;Come, that the night may be held for a wonder,   When the Wolf was led by a maiden's hand!She singeth.Now will I fare as ye are faring,   And wend no way but the way ye wend;And bear but the burdens ye are bearing,   And end the day as ye shall end.And many an eve when the clouds are drifting   Down through the Dale till they dim the roof,Shall they tell in the Hall of the Maiden's Lifting,   And how we drave the spoil aloof.They sing together.Over the moss through the wind and the weather,   Through the morn and the eve and the death of the day,Wend we man and maid together,   For out of the waste is born the fray.Then the Sun-beam spake to Gold-mane softly, and told him how thissong was made by a minstrel concerning a foray in the early days oftheir first abode in Shadowy Vale, and how in good sooth a maiden ledthe fray and was the captain of the warriors:'Erst,' she said, 'this was counted as a wonder; but now we are sofew that it is no wonder though the women will do whatsoever theymay.'So they talked, and Gold-mane was very happy; but ere the good-nightcup was drunk, Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:'It were well that ye rose betimes in the morning:  but thou shaltnot go back by the way thou camest.  Wood-wise and another shall gowith thee, and show thee a way across the necks and the heaths, whichis rough enough as far as toil goes, but where thy life shall besafer; and thereby shalt thou hit the ghyll of the Weltering Water,and so come down safely into Burgdale.  Now that we are friends andfellows, it is no hurt for thee to know the shortest way to ShadowyVale.  What thou shalt tell concerning us in Burgdale I leave thetale thereof to thee; yet belike thou wilt not tell everything till Icome to Burgstead at the spring market-tide.  Now must I presently tobed; for before daylight to-morrow must I be following the hunt alongwith two score good men of ours.''What beast is afield then?' said Gold-mane.Said Folk-might:  'The beasts that beset our lives, the Dusky Men.In these days we have learned how to find companies of them; andforsooth every week they draw nigher to this Dale; and some day theyshould happen upon us if we were not to look to it, and then wouldthere be a murder great and grim; therefore we scour the heaths roundabout, and the skirts of the woodland, and we fall upon these felonsin divers guises, so that they may not know us for the same men;whiles are we clad in homespun, as to-day, and seem like to field-working carles; whiles in scarlet and gold, like knights of theWestland; whiles in wolf-skins; whiles in white glittering gear, likethe Wights of the Waste:  and in all guises these felons, for alltheir fierce hearts, fear us, and flee from us, and we follow andslay them, and so minish their numbers somewhat against the great dayof battle.''Tell me,' said Gold-mane; 'when we fall upon Silver-dale shall theirthralls, the old Dale-dwellers, fight for them or for us?'Said Folk-might:  'The Dusky Men will not dare to put weapons intothe hands of their thralls.  Nay, the thralls shall help us; forthough they have but small stomach for the fight, yet joyfully whenthe fight is over shall they cut their masters' throats.''How is it with these thralls?' said Gold-mane.  'I have never seen athrall.''But I,' said Folk-might, 'have seen a many down in the Cities.  Andthere were thralls who were the tyrants of thralls, and held the whipover them; and of the others there were some who were not very hardlyentreated.  But with these it is otherwise, and they all beargrievous pains daily; for the Dusky Men are as hogs in a garden oflilies.  Whatsoever is fair there have they defiled and deflowered,and they wallow in our fair halls as swine strayed from the dunghill.No delight in life, no sweet days do they have for themselves, andthey begrudge the delight of others therein.  Therefore their thrallsknow no rest or solace; their reward of toil is many stripes, and thehealing of their stripes grievous toil.  To many have they appointedto dig and mine in the silver-yielding cliffs, and of all the tasksis that the sorest, and there do stripes abound the most.  Suchthralls art thou happy not to behold till thou hast set them free; aswe shall do.''Tell me again,' said Face-of-god; 'Is there no mixed folk betweenthese Dusky Men and the Dalesmen, since they have no women of theirown, but lie with the women of the Dale?  Moreover, do not the poorfolk of the Dale beget and bear children, so that there are thrallsborn of thralls?''Wisely thou askest this,' said Folk-might, 'but thereof shall I tellthee, that when a Dusky Carle mingles with a woman of the Dale, thechild which she beareth shall oftenest favour his race and not hers;or else shall it be witless, a fool natural.  But as for the childrenof these poor thralls; yea, the masters cause them to breed if sotheir masterships will, and when the children are born, they keepthem or slay them as they will, as they would with whelps or calves.To be short, year by year these vile wretches grow fiercer and morebeastly, and their thralls more hapless and down-trodden; and now atlast is come the time either to do or to die, as ye men of Burgdaleshall speedily find out.  But now must I go sleep if I am to be whereI look to be at sunrise to-morrow.'Therewith he called for the sleeping-cup, and it was drunk, and allmen fared to bed.  But the Sun-beam took Gold-mane's hand ere theyparted, and said:'I shall arise betimes on the morrow; so I say not farewell to-night;yea, and after to-morrow it shall not be long ere we meet again.'So Gold-mane lay down in that ancient hall, and it seemed to him erehe slept as if his own kindred were slipping away from him and hewere becoming a child of the Wolf.  'And yet,' said he to himself, 'Iam become a man; for my Friend, now she no longer telleth me to do orforbear, and I tremble.  Nay, rather she is fain to take the wordfrom me; and this great warrior and ripe man, he talketh with me asif I were a chieftain meet for converse with chieftains.  Even so itis and shall be.'And soon thereafter he fell asleep in the Hall in Shadowy Vale.CHAPTER XXI.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON THE DUSKY MENWhen he awoke again he saw a man standing over him, and knew him forWood-wise:  he was clad in his war-gear, and had his quiver at hisback and his bow in his hand, for Wood-father's children were allgood bowmen, though not so sure as Bow-may.  He spake to Face-of-god:'Dawn is in the sky, Dalesman; there is yet time for thee to wash thenight off of thee in our bath of the Shivering Flood and to put thymouth to the milk-bowl; but time for nought else:  for I and Bow-mayare appointed thy fellows for the road, and it were well that we wereback home speedily.'So Face-of-god leapt up and went forth from the Hall, and Wood-wiseled to where was a pool in the river with steps cut down to it in therocky bank.'This,' said Wood-wise, 'is the Carle's Bath; but the Queen's islower down, where the water is wider and shallower below the littlemid-dale force.'So Gold-mane stripped off his raiment and leapt into the ice-coldpool; and they had brought his weapons and war-gear with them; sowhen he came out he clad and armed himself for the road, and thenturned with Wood-wise toward the outgate of the Dale; and soon theysaw two men coming from lower down the water in such wise that theywould presently cross their path, and as yet it was little more thantwilight, so that they saw not at first who they were, but as theydrew nearer they knew them for the Sun-beam and Bow-may.  The Sun-beam was clad but in her white linen smock and blue gown as he hadfirst seen her, her hair was wet and dripping with the river, herface fresh and rosy:  she carried in her two hands a great bowl ofmilk, and stepped delicately, lest she should spill it.  But Bow-maywas clad in her war-gear with helm and byrny, and a quiver at herback, and a bended bow in her hand.  So they greeted each otherkindly, and the Sun-beam gave the bowl to Face-of-god and said:'Drink, guest, for thou hast a long and thirsty road before thee.'So Face-of-god drank, and gave her the bowl back again, and shesmiled on him and drank, and the others after her till the bowl wasempty:  then Bow-may put her hand on Wood-wise's shoulder, and theyled on toward the outgate, while those twain followed them hand inhand.  But the Sun-beam said:'This then is the new day I spoke of, and lo! it bringeth oursundering with it; yet shall it be no longer than a day when all issaid, and new days shall follow after.  And now, my friend, I shallsee thee no later than the April market; for doubt not that I shallgo thither with Folk-might, whether he will or not.  Also as I ledthee out of the house when we last met, so shall I lead thee out ofthe Dale to-day, and I will go with thee a little way on the waste;and therefore am I shod this morning, as thou seest, for the ways onthe waste are rough.  And now I bid thee have courage while my handholdeth thine.  For afterwards I need not bid thee anything; for thouwilt have enough to do when thou comest to thy Folk, and must needsthink more of warriors then than of maidens.'He looked at her and longed for her, but said soberly:  'Thou artkind, O friend, and thinkest kindly of me ever.  But methinks it werenot well done for thee to wend with me over a deal of the waste, andcome back by thyself alone, when ye have so many foemen nearby.''Nay,' she said, 'they be nought so near as that yet, and I wot thatFolk-might hath gone forth toward the north-west, where he looketh tofall in with a company of the foemen.  His battle shall be a guardunto us.''I pray thee turn back at the top of the outgate,' said he, 'and benot venturesome.  Thou wottest that the pitcher is not broken thefirst time it goeth to the well, nor maybe the twentieth, but at lastit cometh not back.'She said:  'Nevertheless I shall have my will herein.  And it is buta little way I will wend with thee.'Therewith were they come to the scree, and talk fell down betweenthem as they clomb it; but when they were in the darksome passage ofthe rocks, and could scarce see one another, Face-of-god said:'Where then is another outgate from the Dale?  Is it not up thewater?''Yea,' she said, 'and there is none other:  at the lower end therocks rise sheer from out the water, and a little further down is agreat force thundering betwixt them; so that by no boat or raft mayye come out of the Dale.  But the outgate up the water is called theRoad of War, as this is named the Path of Peace.  But now are allways ways of war.''There is peace in my heart,' said Gold-mane.She answered not for a while, but pressed his hand, and he felt herbreath on his cheek; and even therewithal they came out of the dark,and Gold-mane saw that her cheek was flushed; and now she spake:'One thing would I say to thee, my friend.  Thou hast seen me amongstmen of war, amongst outlaws who seek violence; thou hast heard me bidmy brother to count the slain, and I shrinking not; thou knowest (forI have told thee) how I have schemed and schemed for victoriousbattle.  Yet I would not have thee think of me as a Chooser of theSlain, a warrior maiden, or as of one who hath no joy save in thebattle whereto she biddeth others.  O friend, the many peaceful hoursthat I have had on the grass down yonder, sitting with my rock andspindle in hand, the children round about my knees hearkening to someold story so well remembered by me! or the milking of the kine in thedewy summer even, when all was still but for the voice of the waterand the cries of the happy children, and there round about me werethe dear and beauteous maidens with whom I had grown up, happy amidstall our troubles, since their life was free and they knew no guile.In such times my heart was at peace indeed, and it seemed to me as ifwe had won all we needed; as if war and turmoil were over, after theyhad brought about peace and good days for our little folk.'And as for the days that be, are they not as that rugged pass, fullof bitter winds and the voice of hurrying waters, that leadeth yonderto Silver-dale, as thou hast divined? and there is nought good in itsave that the breath of life is therein, and that it leadeth topleasant places and the peace and plenty of the fair dale.''Sweet friend,' he said, 'what thou sayest is better than well:  fortime shall be, if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitterstrife, when I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there.  Andthou wottest of our people that there is little strife and grudgingamongst them, and that they are merry, and fair to look on, both menand women; and no man there lacketh what the earth may give us, andit is a saying amongst us that there may a man have that which hedesireth save the sun and moon in his hands to play with:  and ofthis gladness, which is made up of many little matters, what storymay be told?  Yet amongst it shall I live and thou with me; and illindeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert ever longing for someday of victorious strife, and to behold me coming back from battlehigh-raised on the shields of men and crowned with bay; if thine earsmust ever be tickled with the talk of men and their songs concerningmy warrior deeds.  For thus it shall not be.  When I drive the herdsit shall be at the neighbours' bidding whereso they will; not necksof men shall I smite, but the stalks of the tall wheat, and the bolesof the timber-trees which the woodreeve hath marked for felling; thestilts of the plough rather than the hilts of the sword shall hardenmy hands; my shafts shall be for the deer, and my spears for thewood-boar, till war and sorrow fall upon us, and I fight for theceasing of war and trouble.  And though I be called a chief and ofthe blood of chiefs, yet shall I not be masterful to the goodman ofthe Dale, but rather to my hound; for my chieftainship shall be thatI shall be well beloved and trusted, and that no man shall grudgeagainst me.  Canst thou learn to love such a life, which to meseemeth lovely?  And thou? of whom I say that thou art as if thouwert come down from the golden chairs of the Burg of the Gods.'They were well-nigh out of the steep path by now, and the daylightwas bright about them; there she stayed her feet a moment and turnedto him and said:'All this should I love even now, if the grief of our Folk were buthealed, and hereafter shall I learn yet more of thy well-belovedface.'Therewith she laid her face to his and kissed him fondly, and put hishand to her side and held it there, saying:  'Soon shall we be one inbody and in soul.'And he laughed with joy and pride of life, and took her hand and ledher on again, and said:'Yet feel the cold rings of my hauberk, my friend; look at the spearsthat cumber my hand, and at Dale-warden hanging by my side.  Thoushalt yet see me as the Slain's Chooser would see her speech-friend;for there is much to do ere we win wheat-harvest in Burgdale.'Therewith they stepped together on to the level ground of the waste,and saw Bow-may sitting on a stone hard by, and Wood-wise standingbeside her bending his bow.  Bow-may smiled on Gold-mane and rose up,and they all went on together, turning so that they went nearlyalongside the wall of the Vale, but westering a little; then the Sun-beam said:'Many a time have I trodden this heath alongside our rock-wall; forif ye wend a little further as our faces are turned, ye come to thecrags over the place where the Shivering Flood goeth out of ShadowyVale.  There when ye have clomb a little may'st thou stand on theedge of the rock-wall, and look down and behold the Flood swirlingand eddying in the black gorge of the rocks, and see presently thereek of the force go up, and hear the thunder of the waters as theypour over it:  and all this about us now is as the garden of ourhouse--is it not so, Bow-may?''Yea,' said she, 'and there are goodly cluster-berries to be gottenhereabout in the autumn; many a time have the Sun-beam and I reddenedour lips with them.  Yet is it best to be wary when war is abroad andhot withal.''Yea,' said the Sun-beam, 'and all this place comes into the story ofour House:  lo!  Gold-mane, two score paces before us a little on ourright hand those five grey stones.  They are called the Rocks of theElders:  for there in the first days of our abiding in Shadowy Valethe Elders were wont to come together to talk privily upon ourmatters.'Face-of-god looked thither as she spoke, but therewith saw Bow-may,who went on the left hand of the Sun-beam, as Face-of-god on herright hand, notch a shaft on her bent bow, and Wood-wise, who was onhis right hand, saw it also and did the like, and therewithal Face-of-god got his target on to his arm, and even as he did so Bow-maycried out suddenly:'Yea, yea!  Cast thyself on to the ground, Sun-beam!  Gold-mane,targe and spear, targe and spear!  For I see steel gleaming yonderout from behind the Elders' Rocks.'Scarce were the words out of her mouth ere three shafts came flying,and the bow-strings twanged.  Gold-mane felt that one smote his helmand glanced from it.  Therewithal he saw the Sun-beam fall to earth,though he knew not if she had but cast herself down as Bow-may bade.Bow-may's string twanged at once, and a yell came from the foemen:but Wood-wise loosed not, but set his hand to his mouth and gave aloud wild cry--Ha! ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow!--ending in a long andexceeding great whoop like nought but the wolf's howl.  Now Gold-manethinking swiftly, in a moment of time, as war-meet men do, judgedthat if the Sun-beam were hurt (and she had made no cry), it were yetwiser to fall on the foe before turning to tend her, or else allmight be lost; so he rushed forward spear in hand and target on arm,and saw, as he opened up the flank of the Elders' Rocks, six men,whereof one leaned aback on the rock with Bow-may's shaft in hisshoulder, and two others were just in act of loosing at him.  In amoment, as he rushed at them, one shaft went whistling by him, andthe other glanced from off his target; he cast a spear as he boundedon, and saw it smite one of the shooters full in the naked face, andsaw the blood spout out and change his face and the man roll over,and then in another moment four men were hewing at him with theirshort steel axes.  He thrust out his target against them, and thenlet the weight of his body come on his other spear, and drave itthrough the second shooter's throat, and even therewith was smittenon the helm so hard that, though the Alderman's work held out, hefell to his knees, holding his target over his head and striving todraw forth Dale-warden; in that nick of time a shaft whistled closeby his ear, and as he rose to his feet again he saw his foemanrolling over and over, clutching at the ling with both hands.  Thenrang out again the terrible wolf-whoop from Wood-wise's mouth, andboth he and Bow-may loosed a shaft, for the two other foes had turnedtheir backs and were fleeing fast.  Again Bow-may hit the clout, andthe Dusky Man fell dead at once, but Wood-wise's arrow flew over thefelon's shoulder as he ran.  Then in a trice was Gold-mane boundingafter him like the hare just roused from her form; for it came intohis head that these felons had beheld them coming up out of the Vale,and that if even this one man escaped, he would bring his companydown upon the Vale-dwellers.Strong and light-foot as any was Face-of-god, and though he wascumbered with his hauberk, yet was Iron-face's handiwork far lighterthan the war-coat of the Dusky Man, and the race was soon over.  Thefelon turned breathless to meet Gold-mane, who drave his targetagainst him and cast him to earth, and as he strove to rise smote offhis head at one stroke; for Dale-warden was a good sword and theDalesman as fierce of mood as might be.  There he let the felon lie,and, turning, walked back swiftly toward the Elders' Rocks, and foundthere Wood-wise and the dead foemen, for the carle had slain thewounded, and he was now drawing the silver arm-rings off the slainmen; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver arm-rings.  But Bow-maywas walking towards the Sun-beam, and thitherward followed Gold-manespeedily.He found her sitting on a tussock of grass close by where she hadfallen, her face pale, her eyes eager and gleaming; she looked up athim as he drew nigher and said:'Friend, art thou hurt?''Nay,' he said, 'and thou?  Thou art pale.''I am not hurt,' she said.  Then she smiled and said again:'Did I not tell thee that I am no warrior like Bow-may here?  Suchdeeds make maidens pale.'Said Bow-may:  'If ye will have the truth, Gold-mane, she is not wontto grow pale when battle is nigh her.  Look you, she hath had thegift of a new delight, and findeth it sweeter and softer than she hadany thought of; and now hath she feared lest it should be taken fromher.''Bow-may saith but the sooth,' said the Sun-beam simply, 'and kind itis of her to say it.  I saw thee, Bow-may, and good was thy shooting,and I love thee for it.'Said Bow-may:  'I never shoot otherwise than well.  But those idleshooters of the Dusky Ones, whereabouts nigh to thee went theirshafts?'Said the Sun-beam:  'One just lifted the hair by my left ear, andthat was not so ill-aimed; as for the other, it pierced my raiment bymy right knee, and pinned me to the earth, so that I tottered andfell, and my gown and smock are grievously wounded, both of them.'And she took the folds of the garments in her hands to show the rentstherein; and her colour was come again, and she was glad.'What were best to do now?' she said.Said Face-of-god:  'Let us tarry a little; for some of thy carlesshall surely come up from the Vale:  because they will have heardWood-wise's whoop, since the wind sets that way.''Yea, they will come,' said the Sun-beam.'Good is that,' said Face-of-god; 'for they shall take the deadfelons and cast them where they be not seen if perchance any morestray hereby.  For if they wind them, they may well happen on thepath down to the Vale.  Also, my friend, it were well if thou wert tobid a good few of the carles that are in the Vale to keep watch andward about here, lest there be more foemen wandering about thewaste.'She said:  'Thou art wise in war, Gold-mane; I will do as thoubiddest me.  But soothly this is a perilous thing that the Dusky Menare gotten so close to the Vale.'Said Face-of-god:  'This will Folk-might look to when he cometh home;and it is most like that he will deem it good to fall on themsomewhere a good way aloof, so as to draw them off from wanderingover the waste.  Also I will do my best to busy them when I am homein Burgdale.'Therewith came up Wood-wise, and fell to talk with them; and his mindit was that these foemen were but a band of strayers, and had had noinkling of Shadowy Vale till they had heard them talking together asthey came up the path from the Vale, and that then they had made thatambush behind the Elders' Rocks, so that they might slay the men, andthen bear off the woman.  He said withal that it would be best tocarry their corpses further on, so that they might be cast over thecliffs into the fierce stream of the Shivering Flood.Amidst this talk came up men from the Vale, a score of them, wellarmed; and they ran to meet the wayfarers; and when they heard whathad befallen, they rejoiced exceedingly, and were above all glad thatFace-of-god had shown himself doughty and deft; and they deemed hisrede wise, to set a watch thereabouts till Folk-might came home, andsaid that they would do even so.Then spake the Sun-beam and said:'Now must ye wayfarers depart; for the road is but rough, and the daynot over-long.'Then she turned to Face-of-god and put her hand on his shoulder, andbrought her face close to his and spake to him softly:'Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee, and that I amnow so familiar to thee, I whom thou didst once deem to be a verygoddess?  And now thou hast seen me redden before thine eyes becauseof thee; and thou hast seen me grow pale with fear because of thee;and thou hast felt my caresses which I might not refrain; even as ifI were altogether such a maiden as ye warriors hang about for a ninedays' wonder, and then all is over save an aching heart--wilt thou doso with me?  Tell me, have I not belittled myself before thee as if Iasked thee to scorn me?  For thus desire dealeth both with maid andman.'He said:  'In all this there is but one thing for me to say, and thatis that I love thee; and surely none the less, but rather the more,because thou lovest me, and art of my kind, and mayest share in mydeeds and think well of them.  Now is my heart full of joy, and onething only weigheth on it; and that is that my kinswoman the Bridebegrudgeth our love together.  For this is the thing that of allthings most misliketh me, that any should bear a grudge against me.'She said:  'Forget not the token, and my message to her.''I will not forget it,' said he.  'And now I bid thee to kiss me evenbefore all these that are looking on; for there is nought to belittleus therein, since we be troth-plight.'And indeed those folk stood all round about them gazing on them, buta little aloof, that they might not hear their words if they wereminded to talk privily.  For they had long loved the Sun-beam, andnow the love of Face-of-god had begun to spring up in their hearts.So the twain embraced and kissed one another, and made no hastethereover; and those men deemed that but meet and right, and clashedtheir weapons on their shields in token of their joy.Then Face-of-god turned about and strode out of the ring of men, withBow-may and Wood-wise beside him, and they went on their journey overthe necks towards Burgstead.  But the Sun-beam turned slowly fromthat place toward the Vale, and two of the stoutest carles went alongwith her to guard her from harm, and she went down into the Valepondering all these things in her heart.Then the other carles dragged off the corpses of the Dusky Men tillthey had brought them to the sheer rocks above the Shivering Flood,and there they tossed them over into the boiling caldron of theforce, and so departed taking with them the silver arm-rings of theslain to add to the tale.But when they came back into the Vale the Sun-beam duly ordered thatwatch and ward to keep the ingate thereto, and note all that shouldbefall till Folk-might came home.CHAPTER XXII.  FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME TO BURGSTEADBut Face-of-god with Bow-may and Wood-wise fared over the waste,going at first alongside the cliffs of the Shivering Flood, and thenafterwards turning somewhat to the west.  They soon had to climb avery high and steep bent going up to a mountain-neck; and the wayover the neck was rough indeed when they were on it, and they toiledout of it into a barren valley, and out of the valley again on to arough neck; and such-like their journey the day long, for they weregoing athwart all those great dykes that went from the ice-mountainstoward the lower dales like the outspread fingers of a hand or theroots of a great tree.  And the ice-mountains they had on their lefthands and whiles at their backs.They went very warily, with their bows bended and spear in hand, butsaw no man, good or bad, and but few living things.  At noon theyrested in a valley where was a stream, but no grass, nought butstones and sand; but where they were at least sheltered from thewind, which was mostly very great in these high wastes; and thereBow-may drew meat and wine from a wallet she bore, and they ate anddrank, and were merry enough; and Bow-may said:'I would I were going all the way with thee, Gold-mane; for I longsore to let my eyes rest a while on the land where I shall one daylive.''Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'art thou minded to dwell there?  We shallbe glad of that.''Whither are thy wits straying?' said she; 'whether I am minded to itor not, I shall dwell there.'And Wood-wise nodded a yea to her.  But Face-of-god said:'Good will be thy dwelling; but wherefore must it be so?'Then Wood-wise laughed and said:  'I shall tell thee in fewer wordsthan she will, and time presses now:  Wood-father and Wood-mother,and I and my two brethren and this woman have ever been about andanigh the Sun-beam; and we deem that war and other troubles have madeus of closer kin to her than we were born, whether ye call itbrotherhood or what not, and never shall we sunder from her in lifeor in death.  So when thou goest to Burgdale with her, there shall webe.'Then was Face-of-god glad when he found that they deemed his weddingso settled and sure; but Wood-wise fell to making ready for the road.And Face-of-god said to him:'Tell me one thing, Wood-wise; that whoop that thou gavest forth whenwe were at handy-strokes e'en now--is it but a cry of thine own or isit of thy Folk, and shall I hear it again?''Thou may'st look to hear it many a time,' said Wood-wise, 'for it isthe cry of the Wolf.  Seldom indeed hath battle been joined where menof our blood are, but that cry is given forth.  Come now, to theroad!'So they went their ways and the road worsened upon them, and toilsomewas the climbing up steep bents and the scaling of doubtful paths inthe cliff-sides, so that the journey, though the distance of it werenot so long to the fowl flying, was much eked out for them, and itwas not till near nightfall that they came on the ghyll of theWeltering Water some six miles above Burgstead.  Forsooth Wood-wisesaid that the way might be made less toilsome though far longer byturning back eastward a little past the vale where they had rested atmidday; and that seemed good to Gold-mane, in case they should bewending hereafter in a great company between Burgdale and ShadowyVale.But now those two went with Face-of-god down a path in the side ofthe cliff whereby him-seemed he had gone before; and they came downinto the ghyll and sat down together on a stone by the water-side,and Face-of-god spake to them kindly, for he deemed them good andtrusty faring-fellows.'Bow-may,' said he, 'thou saidst a while ago that thou wouldst befain to look on Burgdale; and indeed it is fair and lovely, and yemay soon be in it if ye will.  Ye shall both be more than welcome tothe house of my father, and heartily I bid you thither.  For night ison us, and the way back is long and toilsome and beset with peril.Sister Bow-may, thou wottest that it would be a sore grief to me ifthou camest to any harm, and thou also, fellow Wood-wise.  Daylightis a good faring-fellow over the waste.'Said Bow-may:  'Thou art kind, Gold-mane, and that is thy wont, Iknow; and fain were I to-night of the candles in thine hall.  But wemay not tarry; for thou wottest how busy we be at home; and Sun-beamneedeth me, if it were only to make her sure that no Dusky Man isbearing off thine head by its lovely locks.  Neither shall we journeyin the mirk night; for look you, the moon yonder.''Well,' said Face-of-god, 'parting is ill at the best, and I would Icould give you twain a gift, and especially to thee, my sister Bow-may.'Said Wood-wise:  'Thou may'st well do that; or at least promise thegift; and that is all one as if we held it in our hands.''Yea,' said Bow-may, 'Wood-wise and I have been thinking in one waybelike; and I was at point to ask a gift of thee.''What is it?' said Gold-mane.  'Surely it is thine, if it were but aguerdon for thy good shooting.'She laughed and handled the skirts of his hauberk as she said:'Show us the dint in thine helm that the steel axe made thismorning.''There is no such great dint,' said he; 'my father forged that helm,and his work is better than good.''Yea,' said Bow-may, 'and might I have hauberk and helm of hishandiwork, and Wood-wise a good sword of the same, then were I a gladwoman, and this man a happy carle.'Said Gold-mane:  'I am well pleased at thine asking, and so shallIron-face be when he heareth of thine archery; and how that Hall-facewere now his only son but for thy close shooting.  But now must I tothe way; for my heart tells me that there may have been tidings inBurgstead this while I have been aloof.'So they rose all three, and Bow-may said:'Thou art a kind brother, and soon shall we meet again; and that willbe well.'Then he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed both her cheeks;and he kissed Wood-wise, and turned and went his ways, threading thestony tangle about the Weltering Water, which was now at middleheight, and running clear and strong; so turning once he beheld Wood-wise and Bow-may climbing the path up the side of the ghyll, and Bow-may turned to him also and waved her bow as token of farewell.  Thenhe went upon his way, which was rough enough to follow by night,though the moon was shining brightly high aloft.  Yet as he knew hisroad he made but little of it all, and in somewhat more than an hourand a half was come out of the pass into the broken ground at thehead of the Dale, and began to make his way speedily under the brightmoonlight toward the Gate, still going close by the water.  But as hewent he heard of a sudden cries and rumour not far from him, unwontedin that place, where none dwelt, and where the only folk he mightlook to see were those who cast an angle into the pools and eddies ofthe Water.  Moreover, he saw about the place whence came the criestorches moving swiftly hither and thither; so that he looked to hearof new tidings, and stayed his feet and looked keenly about him onevery side; and just then, between his rough path and the shimmer ofthe dancing moonlit water, he saw the moon smite on somethinggleaming; so, as quietly as he could, he got his target on his arm,and shortened his spear in his right hand, and then turned sharplytoward that gleam.  Even therewith up sprang a man on his right hand,and then another in front of him just betwixt him and the water; anaxe gleamed bright in the moon, and he caught a great stroke on histarget, and therewith drave his left shoulder straight forward, sothat the man before him fell over into the water with a mightysplash; for they were at the very edge of the deepest eddy of theWater.  Then he spun round on his heel, heeding not that anotherstroke had fallen on his right shoulder, yet ill-aimed, and not withthe full edge, so that it ran down his byrny and rent it not.  So hesent the thrust of his spear crashing through the face and skull ofthe smiter, and looked not to him as he fell, but stood still,brandishing his spear and crying out, 'For the Burg and the Face!For the Burg and the Face!'No other foe came against him, but like to the echo of his cry rose aclear shout not far aloof, 'For the Face, for the Face!  For the Burgand the Face!'  He muttered, 'So ends the day as it begun,' andshouted loud again, 'For the Burg and the Face!'  And in a minutemore came breaking forth from the stone-heaps into the moonlit spacebefore the water the tall shapes of the men of Burgstead, the redtorchlight and the moonlight flashing back from their war-gear andweapons; for every man had his sword or spear in hand.Hall-face was the first of them, and he threw his arms about hisbrother and said:  'Well met, Gold-mane, though thou comest amongstus like Stone-fist of the Mountain.  Art thou hurt?  With whom hastthou dealt?  Where be they?  Whence comest thou?''Nay, I am not hurt,' said Face-of-god.  'Stint thy questions then,till thou hast told me whom thou seekest with spear and sword andcandle.''Two felons were they,' said Hall-face, 'even such as ye saw lyingdead at Wood-grey's the other day.''Then may ye sheathe your swords and go home,' said Gold-mane, 'forone lieth at the bottom of the eddy, and the other, thy feet arewell-nigh treading on him, Hall-face.'Then arose a rumour of praise and victory, and they brought thetorches nigh and looked at the fallen man, and found that he wasstark dead; so they even let him lie there till the morrow, and allturned about toward the Thorp; and many looked on Face-of-god andwondered concerning him, whence he was and what had befallen him.Indeed, they would have asked him thereof, but could not get at himto ask; but whoso could, went as nigh to Hall-face and him as theymight, to hearken to the talk between the brothers.So as they went along Hall-face did verily ask him whence he came:'For was it not so,' said he, 'that thou didst enter into the woodseeking some adventure early in the morning the day beforeyesterday?''Sooth is that,' said Face-of-god, 'and I came to Shadowy Vale, andthence am I come this morning.'Said Hall-face:  'I know not Shadowy Vale, nor doth any of us.  Thisis a new word.  How say ye, friends, doth any man here know ofShadowy Vale?'They all said, 'Nay.'Then said Hall-face:  'Hast thou been amongst mere ghosts andmarvels, brother, or cometh this tale of thy minstrelsy?''For all your words,' said Gold-mane, 'to that Vale have I been; and,to speak shortly (for I desire to have your tale, and am waiting forit), I will tell thee that I found there no marvels or strangewights, but a folk of valiant men; a folk small in numbers, but greatof heart; a folk come, as we be, from the Fathers and the Gods.  Andthis, moreover, is to be said of them, that they are the foes ofthese felons of whom ye were chasing these twain.  And these sameDusky Men of Silver-dale would slay them every man if they might; andif we look not to it they will soon be doing the same by us; for theyare many, and as venomous as adders, as fierce as bears, and as foulas swine.  But these valiant men, who bear on their banner the imageof the Wolf, should be our fellows in arms, and they have good willthereto; and they shall show us the way to Silver-dale by blindpaths, so that we may fall upon these felons while they dwell theretormenting the poor people of the land, and thus may we destroy themas lads a hornet's nest.  Or else the days shall be hard for us.'The men who hung about them drank in his words greedily.  But Hall-face was silent a little while, and then he said:  'Brother Gold-mane, these be great tidings.  Time was when we might have deemedthem but a minstrel's tale; for Silver-dale we know not, of whichthou speakest so glibly, nor the Dusky Men, any more than the ShadowyVale.  Howbeit, things have befallen these two last days so strangeand new, that putting them together with the murder at Wood-grey's,and thy words which seem somewhat wild, it may well seem to us thattidings unlooked for are coming our way.''Come, then,' said Face-of-god, 'give me what thou hast in thy scrip,and trust me, I shall not jeer at thy tale.'Said Hall-face:  'I also will be short with the tale; and that themore, as meseemeth it is not yet done, and that thou thyself shaltshare in the ending of it.  It was the day before yesterday, that isthe day when thou departedst into the woods on that adventure whereofthou shalt one day tell me more, wilt thou not?''Yea, in good time,' said Face-of-god.'Well,' quoth Hall-face, 'we went into the woods that day and in themorning, but after sunrise, to the number of a score:  we looked tomeet a bear and a she-bear with cubs in a certain place; for one ofthe Woodlanders, a keen hunter, had told us of their lair.  Also wewere wishful to slay some of the wild-swine, the yearlings, if wemight.  Therefore, though we had no helms or shields or coats offence, we had bowshot a plenty, and good store of casting-weapons,besides our wood-knives and an axe or so; and some of us, of whom Iwas one, bore our battle-swords, as we are wont ever to do, be thefoe beast or man.'Thus armed we went up Wildlake's Way and came to Carlstead, wherehalf-a-score Woodlanders joined themselves to us, so that we became aband.  We went up the half-cleared places past Carlstead for a mile,and then turned east into the wood, and went I know not how far, forthe Woodlanders led us by crooked paths, but two hours wore away inour going, till we came to the place where they looked to find thebears.  It is a place that may well be noted, for it is unlike thewood round about.  There is a close thicket some two furlongs aboutof thorn and briar and ill-grown ash and oak and other trees, plantedby the birds belike; and it stands as it were in an island amidst ofa wide-spreading woodlawn of fine turf, set about in the most goodlyfashion with great tall straight-boled oak-trees, that seem to havebeen planted of set purpose by man's hand.  Yea, dost thou know theplace?''Methinks I do,' said Gold-mane, 'and I seem to have heard theWoodlanders give it a name and call it Boars-bait.''That may be,' said Hall-face.  'Well, there we were, the dogs andthe men, and we drew nigh the thicket and beset it, and doubted notto find prey therein:  but when we would set the dogs at the thicketto enter it, they were uneasy, and would not take up the slot, butgrowled and turned about this way and that, so that we deemed thatthey winded some fierce beast at our flanks or backs.'Even so it was, and fierce enough and deadly was the beast; forsuddenly we heard bow-strings twang, and shafts came flying; andIron-shield of the Upper Dale, who was close beside me, leapt up intothe air and fell down dead with an arrow through his back.  Then Ibethought me in the twinkling of an eye, and I cried out, "The foeare on us! take the cover of the tree-boles and be wary!  For theBurg and the Face!  For the Burg and the Face!"'So we scattered and covered ourselves with the oak-boles, butbesides Iron-shield, who was slain outright, two goodmen were sorelyhurt, to wit Bald-face, a man of our house, and Stonyford of theLower Dale.'I looked from behind my tree-bole, a great one; and far off down theglades I saw men moving, clad in gay raiment; but nearer to me, not ahundred yards from my cover, I saw an arm clad in scarlet come outfrom behind a tree-bole, so I loosed at it, and missed not; forstraight there tottered out from behind the tree one of those duskyfoul-favoured men like to those that were slain by Wood-grey.  I hadanother shaft ready notched, so I loosed and set the shaft in histhroat, and he fell.'Straightway was a yelling and howling about us like the cries ofscalded curs, and the oak-wood swarmed thick with these felonsrushing on us; for it seems that the man whom I had slain was a chiefamongst them, or we judged so by his goodly raiment.'Methought then our last day was come.  What could we do but runtogether again after we had loosed at a venture, and so withstandthem sword and spear in hand?  Some fell beneath our shot, but notmany, for they came on very swiftly.'So they fell on us; but for all their fierceness and their numbersthey might not break our array, and we slew four and hurt many bysword-hewing and spear-casting and push of spear; and five of us werehurt and one slain by their dart-casting.  So they drew off from us alittle, and strove to spread out and fall to shooting at us again;but this we would not suffer, but pushed on as they fell back,keeping as close together as we might for the trees.  For we saidthat we would all die together if needs must; and verily the stourwas hard.'Yet hearken!  In that nick of time rose up a strange cry not farfrom us, Ha! ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow! ending like the howl of a wolf,and then another and another and another, till the whole wood rangagain.'At first we deemed that here were come fresh foemen, and that wewere undone indeed; but when they heard it, the foe-men before usfaltered and gave way, and at last turned their backs and fled, andwe followed, keeping well together still:  thereby the more part ofthese men escaped us, for they fled wildly here and there from thosewho bore that cry with them; so we knew that our work was being donefor us; therefore we stood, and saw tall men clad in sheep-brown weedrunning through the glades pursuing those felons and smiting themdown, till both fleers and pursuers passed out of our sight like menin a dream, or as when ye roll up a pictured cloth to lay it in thecoffer.'But to Stone-face's mind those brown-clad men were the Wights of theWood that be of the Fathers' blood, and our very friends; and whensome of us would yet have gone forward and foregathered with them,and followed the chase along with them, Stone-face gainsaid it,bidding us not to run into the arms of a second death, when we hadbut just escaped from the first.  Sooth to say, moreover, we haddivers hurt men that needed looking to.'So what with one thing, what with another, we turned back:  but War-cliff's brother, a tall man, had felled two of those felons with anoak sapling which he had torn from the thicket; but he had not slainthem, and by now they were just awakening from their swoon, and weresitting up looking round them with fierce rolling eyes, expecting thestroke, for Raven of Longscree was standing over them with a nakedwar-sword in his hand.  But now that our blood was cool, we were lothto slay them as they lay in our hands; so we bound them and broughtthem away with us; and our own dead we carried also on such biers aswe might lightly make there, and with them three that were sogrievously hurt that they might not go afoot, these we left atCarlstead:  they were Tardy the Son of the Untamed, and Swan of Bull-meadow, both of the Lower Dale, and a Woodlander, Undoomed to wit.But the dead were Iron-shield aforesaid, and Wool-sark, and theHewer, a Woodlander.'So came we sadly at eventide to Burgstead with the two deadBurgdalers, and the captive felons, and the wounded of us that mightgo afoot; and ye may judge that they of Burgdale and our fatherdeemed these tidings great enough, and wotted not what next shouldbefall.  Stone-face would have had those two felons slain there andthen; for no true tale could we get out of them, nor indeed any wordat all.  But the Alderman would not have it so; and he deemed theymight serve our turn as hostages if any of our folk should be taken:for one and all we deemed, and still deem, that war is on us and thatnew folk have gathered on our skirts.'So the captives were shut up in the red out-bower of our house; andour father was minded that thou mightest tell us somewhat of themwhen thou wert come home.  But about dusk to-day the word went thatthey had broken out and gotten them weapons and fled up the Dale; andso it was.'But to-morrow morning will a Gate-thing be holden, and there it willbe looked for of thee that thou tell us a true tale of thy goings.For it is deemed, and it is my deeming especially, that thou may'sttell us more of these men than thou hast yet told us.  Is it not so?''Yea, surely,' said Gold-mane, 'I can make as many words as ye willabout it; yet when all is said, it will come to much the same tale asI have already told thee.  Yet belike, if ye are minded to take upthe sword to defend you, I may tell you in what wise to lay hold onthe hilts.''And that is well,' said Hall-face, 'and no less do I look for ofthee.  But lo! here are we come to the Gate of the Burg that abidethbattle.'CHAPTER XXIII.  TALK IN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF THE FACEIn sooth they were come to the very Gate of Burgstead, and the greatgates were shut, and only a wicket was open, and a half score ofstout men in all their war-gear were holding ward thereby.  They gaveplace to Hall-face and his company, albeit some of the wardersfollowed them through the wicket that they might hear the story told.The street was full of folk, both men and women, talking togethereagerly concerning all these tidings, and when they saw the men ofthe Hue-and-cry they came thronging about them, so that they mightscarce get to the door of the House of the Face because of the press;so Hall-face (who was a very tall man) cried out:'Good people, all is well! the runaways are slain, and Face-of-god iscome back with us; give place a little, that we may come into ourhouse.'Then the throng set up a shout, and made way a little, so that Hall-face and Gold-mane and the others could get to the door.  And theyentered into the Hall, and saw much folk therein; and men weresitting at table, for supper was not yet over.  But when they saw thenew-comers they mostly rose up from the board and stood silent tohear the tale, for they had been talking many together each to each,so that the Hall was full of confused noise.So Hall-face again cried out:  'Men in this hall, good is thetidings.  The runaways are slain; and it was Face-of-god who slewthem as he came back safe from the waste.'Then they shouted for joy, and the brethren and Stone-face with them(for he had entered with them from the street) went up on to thedais, while the others of the Hue-and-cry gat them seats where theymight at the endlong tables.But when Face-of-god came up on to the dais, there sat Iron-facelooking down on the thronged Hall with a ruddy cheerful countenance,and beside him sat the Bride; for he had caused her to be broughtthither when he had heard of the tidings of battle.  She was daintilyclad in a flame-coloured kirtle embroidered with gold about the bosomand sleeves, and there was a fillet of golden roses on her ruddyhair.  Her eyes shone bright and eager, and the pommels of her cheekswere flushed and red contrary to their wont.  Needs must Gold-manesit by her, and when he came close to her he knew not what to do, buthe put forth his hand to her, yet with a troubled countenance; for hefeared her grief mingled with her beauty:  as for her, she wavered inher mind whether she should forbear to touch him or not; but she sawthat men about were looking at them, and especially was Iron-facelooking on her:  therefore she stood up and took Gold-mane's hand andkissed his face as she had been wont to do, and by then was her faceas white as paper; and her anguish pierced his heart, so that hewell-nigh groaned for grief of her.  But Iron-face looked on her andsaid kindly:'Kinswoman, thou art pale; thou hast feared for thy mate amidst allthese tidings of war, and still fearest for him.  But pluck up aheart; for the man is a deft warrior for all his fair face, whichthou lovest as a woman should, and his hands may yet save his head.And if he be slain, yet are there other men of the kindred, and theearth will not be a desert to thee even then.'She looked at Iron-face, and the colour was come back to her facesomewhat, and she said:'It is true; I have feared for him; for he goeth into perilousplaces.  But for thee, thou art kind, and I thank thee for it.'And therewith she kissed Iron-face and sat down in her place, andstrove to overmaster her grief, that her face might not be changed byit; for now were thoughts of battle, and valiant hopes arising inmen's hearts; and it seemed to her too grievous if she should marthat feast on the eve of battle.But Iron-face kissed and embraced his son and said:  'Art thou latecome from the waste?  Hast thou seen new things?  We look to have anotable tale from thee; though here also have been tidings, and it isnot unlike that we shall presently have new work on our hands.''Father,' quoth Face-of-god, 'I deem that when thou hast heard mytale thou wilt think no less of it than that there are valiant folkto be holpen, poor folk to be delivered, and evil folk to be sweptfrom off the face of the earth.''It is well, son,' said Iron-face.  'I see that thy tale is long; letit alone for to-night.  To-morrow shall we hold a Gate-thing, andthen shall we hear all that thou hast to tell.  Now eat thy meat anddrink a bowl of wine, and comfort thy troth-plight maiden.'So Gold-mane sat down by the Bride, and ate and drank as he needsmust; but he was ill at ease and he durst not speak to her.  For, onthe one hand, he thought concerning his love for the Sun-beam, andhow sweet and good a thing it was that she should take him by thehand and lead him into noble deeds and great fame, caressing him sosoftly and sweetly the while; and, on the other hand, there sat theBride beside him, sorrowful and angry, begrudging all that sweetnessof love, as though it were something foul and unseemly; and heavy onhim lay the weight of that grudge, for he was a man of a friendlyheart.Stone-face sat outward from him on the other side of the Bride; andhe leaned across her towards Gold-mane and said:'Fair shall be thy tale to-morrow, if thou tellest us all thineadventure.  Or wilt thou tell us less than all?'Said Face-of-god:  'In good time shalt thou know it all, foster-father; but it is not unlike that by the time that thou hast heardit, there shall be so many other things to tell of, that my taleshall seem of little account to thee--even as the saw saith that onenail driveth out the other.''Yea,' said Stone-face, 'but one tale belike shall be knit up withthe others, as it fareth with the figures that come one after otheron the weaver's cloth; though one maketh not the other, yet onecometh of the other.'Said Face-of-god:  'Wise art thou now, foster-father, but thou shaltbe wiser yet in this matter by then a month hath worn:  and to-morrowshalt thou know enough to set thine hands a-work.'So the talk fell between them; and the night wore, and the men ofBurgdale feasted in their ancient hall with merry hearts, littleweighed down by thought of the battle that might be and the troubleto come; for they were valorous and kindly folk.CHAPTER XXIV.  FACE-OF-GOD GIVETH THAT TOKEN TO THE BRIDENow on the morrow, when Face-of-god arose and other men with him, andthe Hall was astir and there was no little throng therein, the Bridecame up to him; for she had slept in the House of the Face by thebidding of the Alderman; and she spake to him before all men, andbade him come forth with her into the garden, because she would speakto him apart.  He yeasaid her, though with a heavy heart; and to thefolk about that seemed meet and due, since those twain were deemed tobe troth-plight, and they smiled kindly on them as they went out ofthe Hall together.So they came into the garden, where the pear-trees were blossomingover the spring lilies, and the cherries were showering their flowerson the deep green grass, and everything smelled sweetly on the warmwindless spring morning.She led the way, going before him till they came by a smooth grasspath between the berry bushes, to a square space of grass about whichwere barberry trees, their first tender leaves bright green in thesun against the dry yellowish twigs.  There was a sundial amidmost ofthe grass, and betwixt the garden-boughs one could see the long greyroof of the ancient hall; and sweet familiar sounds of the nestingbirds and men and women going on their errands were all about in thescented air.  She turned about at the sundial and faced Face-of-god,her hand lightly laid on the scored brass, and spake with no anger inher voice:'I ask thee if thou hast brought me the token whereon thou shaltswear to give me that gift.''Yea,' said he; and therewith drew the ring from his bosom, and heldit out to her.  She reached out her hand to him slowly and took it,and their fingers met as she did so, and he noted that her hand waswarm and firm and wholesome as he well remembered it.She said:  'Whence hadst thou this fair finger-ring?'Said Face-of-god:  'My friend there in the mountain-valley drew itfrom off her finger for thee, and bade me bear thee a message.'Her face flushed red:  'Yea,' she said, 'and doth she send me amessage?  Then doth she know of me, and ye have talked of metogether.  Well, give the message!'Said Face-of-god:  'She saith, that thou shalt bear in mind, That to-morrow is a new day.''Yea,' she said, 'for her it is so, and for thee; but not for me.But now I have brought thee here that thou mightest swear thine oathto me; lay thine hand on this ring and on this brazen plate wherebythe sun measures the hours of the day for happy folk, and swear bythe spring-tide of the year and all glad things that find a mate, andby the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man.'Then he laid his hand on the finger-ring as it lay on the dial-plateand said:'By the spring-tide and the live things that long to multiply theirkind; by the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in the life of man, Iswear to give to my kinswoman the Bride the second man-child that Ibeget; to be hers, to leave or cherish, to love or hate, as her willmay bid her.'  Then he looked on her soberly and said:  'It is dulysworn; is it enough?''Yea,' she said; but he saw how the tears ran out of her eyes andwetted the bosom of her kirtle, and she hung her head for shame ofher grief.  And Gold-mane was all abashed, and had no word to say;for he knew that no word of his might comfort her; and he deemed itill done to stay there and behold her sorrow; and he knew not how toget him gone, and be glad elsewhere, and leave her alone.Then, as if she had read his thought, she looked up at him and saidsmiling a little amidst of her tears:'I bid thee stay by me till the flood is over; for I have yet a wordto say to thee.'So he stood there gazing down on the grass in his turn, and notdaring to raise his eyes to her face, and the minutes seemed long tohim:  till at last she said in a voice scarcely yet clear of weeping:'Wilt thou say anything to me, and tell me what thou hast done, andwhy, and what thou deemest will come of it?'He said:  'I will tell the truth as I know it, because thou askest itof me, and not because I would excuse myself before thee.  What haveI done?  Yesterday I plighted my troth to wed the woman that I metlast autumn in the wood.  And why?  I wot not why, but that I longedfor her.  Yet I must tell thee that it seemed to me, and yet seemeth,that I might do no otherwise--that there was nothing else in theworld for me to do.  What do I deem will come of it, sayest thou?This, that we shall be happy together, she and I, till the day of ourdeath.'She said:  'And even so long shall I be sorry:  so far are wesundered now.  Alas! who looked for it?  And whither shall I turn tonow?'Said Gold-mane:  'She bade me tell thee that to-morrow is a new day:meseemeth I know her meaning.''No word of hers hath any meaning to me,' said the Bride.'Nay,' said he, 'but hast thou not heard these rumours of war thatare in the Dale?  Shall not these things avail thee?  Much may growout of them; and thou with the mighty heart, so faithful andcompassionate!'She said:  'What sayest thou?  What may grow out of them?  Yea, Ihave heard those rumours as a man sick to death heareth men talk oftheir business down in the street while he lieth on his bed; andalready he hath done with it all, and hath no world to mend or mar.For me nought shall grow out of it.  What meanest thou?'Said Gold-mane:  'Is there nought in the fellowship of Folks, and theaiding of the valiant, and the deliverance of the hapless?''Nay,' she said, 'there is nought to me.  I cannot think of it to-daynor yet to-morrow belike.  Yet true it is that I may mingle in it,though thinking nought of it.  But this shall not avail me.'She was silent a little, but presently spake and said:  'Thou sayestright; it is not thou that hast done this, but the woman who sent methe ring and the message of an old saw.  O that she should be born tosunder us!  How hath it befallen that I am now so little to thee andshe so much?'And again she was silent; and after a while Face-of-god spake kindlyand softly and said:  'Kinswoman, wilt thou for ever begrudge ourlove? this grudge lieth heavy on my soul, and it is I alone that haveto bear it.'She said:  'This is but a light burden for thee to bear, when thouhast nought else to bear!  But do I begrudge thee thy love, Gold-mane?  I know not that.  Rather meseemeth I do not believe in it--norshall do ever.'Then she held her peace a long while, nor did he speak one word:  andthey were so still, that a robin came hopping about them, close tothe hem of her kirtle, and a starling pitched in the apple-tree hardby and whistled and chuckled, turning about and about, heeding themnought.  Then at last she lifted up her face from looking on thegrass and said:  'These are idle words and avail nothing:  one thingonly I know, that we are sundered.  And now it repenteth me that Ihave shown thee my tears and my grief and my sickness of the earthand those that dwell thereon.  I am ashamed of it, as if thou hadstsmitten me, and I had come and shown thee the stripes, and said, Seewhat thou hast done! hast thou no pity?  Yea, thou pitiest me, andwilt try to forget thy pity.  Belike thou art right when thou sayest,To-morrow is a new day; belike matters will arise that will call meback to life, and I shall once more take heed of the joy and sorrowof my people.  Nay, it is most like that this I shall feign to doeven now.  But if to-morrow be a new day, it is to-day now and notto-morrow, and so shall it be for long.  Hereof belike we shall talkno more, thou and I.  For as the days wear, the dealings between usshall be that thou shalt but get thee away from my life, and I shallbe nought to thee but the name of a kinswoman.  Thus should it beeven wert thou to strive to make it otherwise; and thou shalt NOTstrive.  So let all this be; for this is not the word I had to say tothee.  But hearken! now are we sundered, and it irketh me beyondmeasure that folk know it not, and are kind, and rejoice in our love,and deem it a happy thing for the folk; and this burden I may bear nolonger.  So I shall declare unto men that I will not wed thee; andbelike they may wonder why it is, till they see thee wedded to theWoman of the Mountain.  Art thou content that so it shall be?'Said Face-of-god:  'Nay, thou shalt not take this all upon thyself; Ialso shall declare unto the Folk that I will wed none but her, theMountain-Woman.'She said:  'This shalt thou not do; I forbid it thee.  And I WILLtake it all upon myself.  Shall I have it said of me that I am unmeetto wed thee, and that thou hast found me out at last and at latest?I lay this upon thee, that wheresoever I declare this and whatsoeverI may say, thou shalt hold thy peace.  This at least thou may'st dofor me.  Wilt thou?''Yea,' he said, 'though it shall put me to shame.'Again she was silent for a little; then she said:'O Gold-mane, this would I take upon myself not soothly for any shameof seeming to be thy cast-off; but because it is I who needs mustbear all the sorrow of our sundering; and I have the will to bear itgreater and heavier, that I may be as the women of old time, and theythat have come from the Gods, lest I belittle my life with malice andspite and confusion, and it become poisonous to me.  Be at peace! beat peace!  And leave all to the wearing of the years; and forget notthat which thou hast sworn!'Therewith she turned and went from that green place toward the Houseof the Face, walking slowly through the garden amongst the sweetodours, beneath the fair blossoms, a body most dainty and beauteousof fashion, but the casket of grievous sorrow, which all thatgoodliness availed not.But Face-of-god lingered in that place a little, and for that littlewhile the joy of his life was dulled and overworn; and the daysbefore his wandering on the mountain seemed to him free and carelessand happy days that he could not but regret.  He was ashamed,moreover, that this so unquenchable grief should come but of him, andthe pleasure of his life, which he himself had found out for himself,and which was but such a little portion of the Earth and the deedsthereof.  But presently his thought wandered from all this, and as heturned away from the sundial and went his ways through the garden, hecalled to mind his longing for the day of the spring market, when heshould see the Sun-beam again and be cherished by the sweetness ofher love.CHAPTER XXV.  OF THE GATE-THING AT BURGSTEADBut now must he hasten, for the Gate-thing was to be holden two hoursbefore noon; so he betook him speedily to the Hall, and took hisshield and did on a goodly helm and girt his sword to his side, formen must needs go to all folk-motes with their weapons and clad inwar-gear.  Thus he went forth to the Gate with many others, and therealready were many folk assembled in the space aforesaid betwixt theGate of the Burg and the sheer rocks on the face of which were thesteps that led up to the ancient Tower on the height.  The Aldermanwas sitting on the great stone by the Gate-side which was hisappointed place, and beside him on the stone bench were the sixWardens of the Burg; but of the six Wardens of the Dale there werebut three, for the others had not yet heard tell of the battle or hadgot the summons to the Thing, since they had been about theirbusiness down the Dale.Face-of-god took his place silently amongst the neighbours, but menmade way for him, so that he must needs stand in front, facing hisfather and the Wardens; and there went up a murmur of expectationround about him, both because the word had gone about that he had atale of new tidings to tell, and also because men deemed him theirbest and handiest man, though he was yet so young.Now the Alderman looked around and beheld a great throng gatheredtogether, and he looked on the shadow of the Gate which thesouthering sun was casting on the hard white ground of the Thing-stead, and he saw that it had just taken in the standing-stone whichwas in the midst of the place.  On the face of the said stone wascarven the image of a fighting man with shield on arm and axe inhand; for it had been set there in old time in memory of the man whohad bidden the Folk build the Gate and its wall, and had showed themhow to fashion it:  for he was a deft house-smith as well as a greatwarrior; and his name was Iron-hand.  So when the Alderman saw thatthis stone was wholly within the shadow of the Gate he knew that itwas the due time for the hallowing-in of the Thing.  So he bade oneof the wardens who sat beside him and had a great slug-horn slungabout him, to rise and set the horn to his mouth.So that man arose and blew three great blasts that went bellowingabout the towers and down the street, and beat back again from theface of the sheer rocks and up them and over into the wild-wood; andthe sound of it went on the light west-wind along the lips of theDale toward the mountain wastes.  And many a goodman, when he heardthe voice of the horn in the bright spring morning, left spade or axeor plough-stilts, or the foddering of the ewes and their younglings,and turned back home to fetch his sword and helm and hasten to theThing, though he knew not why it was summoned:  and women wendingover the meadows, who had not yet heard of the battle in the wood,hearkened and stood still on the green grass or amidst the ripples ofthe ford, and the threat of coming trouble smote heavy on theirhearts, for they knew that great tidings must be towards if a Thingmust needs be summoned so close to the Great Folk-mote.But now the Alderman stood up and spake amidst the silence thatfollowed the last echoes of the horn:'Now is hallowed in this Gate-thing of the Burgstead Men and the Menof the Dale, wherein they shall take counsel concerning matters latebefallen, that press hard upon them.  Let no man break the peace ofthe Holy Thing, lest he become a man accursed in holy places from theplain up to the mountain, and from the mountain down to the plain; aman not to be cherished of any man of good will, not be holpen withvictuals or edge-tool or draught-beast; a man to be sheltered underno roof-tree, and warmed at no hearth of man:  so help us the Warriorand the God of the Earth, and Him of the Face, and all the Fathers!'When he had spoken men clashed their weapons in token of assent; andhe sat down again, and there was silence for a space.  But presentlycame thrusting forward a goodman of the Dale, who seemed as if he hadcome hurriedly to the Thing; for his face was running down withsweat, his wide-rimmed iron cap sat awry over his brow, and he wasgirt with a rusty sword without a scabbard, and the girdle was ill-braced up about his loins.  So he said:'I am Red-coat of Waterless of the Lower Dale.  Early this morning asI was going afield I met on the way a man akin to me, Fox of Upton towit, and he told me that men were being summoned to a Gate-thing.  SoI turned back home, and caught up any weapon that came handy, andhere I am, Alderman, asking thee of the tidings which hath driventhee to call this Thing so hard on the Great Folk-mote, for I knowthem nothing so.'Then stood up Iron-face the Alderman and said:  'This is well asked,and soon shall ye be as wise as I am on this matter.  Know ye, O menof Burgstead and the Dale, that we had not called this Gate-thing sohard on the Great Folk-mote had not great need been to look intotroublous matters.  Long have ye dwelt in peace, and it is years onyears now since any foeman hath fallen on the Dale:  but, as ye willbear in mind, last autumn were there ransackings in the Dale andamidst of the Shepherds after the manner of deeds of war; and ittroubleth us that none can say who wrought these ill deeds.  Next,but a little while agone, was Wood-grey, a valiant goodman of theWoodlanders, slain close to his own door by evil men.  These men wetook at first for mere gangrel felons and outcasts from their ownfolk:  though there were some who spoke against that from thebeginning.'But thirdly are new tidings again:  for three days ago, while someof the folk were hunting peaceably in the Wild-wood and thinking noevil, they were fallen upon of set purpose by a host of men-at-arms,and nought would serve but mere battle for dear life, so that many ofour neighbours were hurt, and three slain outright; and now markthis, that those who there fell upon our folk were clad and armedeven as the two felons that slew Wood-grey, and moreover were likethem in aspect of body.  Now stand forth Hall-face my son, and answerto my questions in a loud voice, so that all may hear thee.'So Hall-face stood forth, clad in gleaming war-gear, with an axe overhis shoulder, and seemed a doughty warrior.  And Iron-face said tohim:'Tell me, son, those whom ye met in the wood, and of whom ye broughthome two captives, how much like were they to the murder-carles atWood-grey's?'Said Hall-face:  'As like as peas out of the same cod, and to oureyes all those whom we saw in the wood might have been sons of onefather and one mother, so much alike were they.''Yea,' said the Alderman; 'now tell me how many by thy deeming fellupon you in the wood?'Said Hall-face:  'We deemed that if they were any less thanthreescore, they were little less.''Great was the odds,' said the Alderman.  'Or how many were ye?''One score and seven,' said Hall-face.Said the Alderman:  'And yet ye escaped with life all save thosethree?'Hall-face said:  'I deem that scarce one should have come back alive,had it not been that as we fought came a noise like the howling ofwolves, and thereat the foemen turned and fled, and there followed onthe fleers tall men clad in sheep-brown raiment, who smote them downas they fled.''Here then is the story, neighbours,' said the Alderman, 'and ye maysee thereby that if those slayers of Wood-grey were outcast, theirband is a great one; but it seemeth rather that they were men of afolk whose craft it is to rob with the armed hand, and to slay therobbed; and that they are now gathering on our borders for war.  Yet,moreover, they have foemen in the woods who should be fellows-in-armsof us.  How sayest thou, Stone-face?  Thou art old, and hast seenmany wars in the Dale, and knowest the Wild-wood to its innermost.'Alderman,' said Stone-face, 'and ye neighbours of the Dale, maybethese foes whom ye have met are not of the race of man, but aretrolls and wood-wights.  Now if they be trolls it is ill, for then isthe world growing worser, and the wood shall be right perilous forthose who needs must fare therein.  Yet if they be men it is a worsematter; for the trolls would not come out of the waste into thesunlight of the Dale.  But these foes, if they be men, are lustingafter our fair Dale to eat it up, and it is most like that they aregathering a huge host to fall upon us at home.  Such things I haveheard of when I was young, and the aspect of the evil men who overranthe kindreds of old time, according to all tales and lays that I haveheard, is even such as the aspect of those whom we have seen of late.As to those wolves who saved the neighbours and chased their foemen,there is one here who belike knoweth more of all this than we do, andthat, O Alderman, is thy son whom I have fostered, Face-of-god towit.  Bid him answer to thy questioning, and tell us what he hathseen and heard of late; then shall we verily know the whole story asfar as it can be known.'Then men pressed round, and were eager to hear what Face-of-god wouldbe saying.  But or ever the Alderman could begin to question him, thethrong was cloven by new-comers, and these were the men who had beensent to bring home the corpses of the Dusky Men:  so they had castloaded hooks into the Weltering Water, and had dragged up him whomFace-of-god had shoved into the eddy, and who had sunk like a stonejust where he fell, and now they were bringing him on a bier alongwith him who had been slain a-land.  They were set down in the placebefore the Alderman, and men who had not seen them before lookedeagerly on them that they might behold the aspect of their foemen;and nought lovely were they to look on; for the drowned man wasalready bleached and swollen with the water, and the other, his facewas all wryed and twisted with that spear-thrust in the mouth.Then the Alderman said:  'I would question my son Face-of-god.  Lethim stand forth!'And therewith he smiled merrily in his son's face, for he wasstanding right in front of him; and he said:'Ask of me, Alderman, and I will answer.''Kinsman,' said Iron-face, 'look at these two dead men, and tell me,if thou hast seen any such besides those two murder-carles who wereslain at Carlstead; or if thou knowest aught of their folk?'Said Face-of-god:  'Yesterday I saw six others like to these both inarray and of body, and three of them I slew, for we were in battlewith them early in the morning.'There was a murmur of joy at this word, since all men took thesefelons for deadly foemen; but Iron-face said:  'What meanest thou by"we"?''I and the men who had guested me overnight,' said Face-of-god, 'andthey slew the other three; or rather a woman of them slew thefelons.''Valiant she was; all good go with her hand!' said the Alderman.'But what be these people, and where do they dwell?'Said Face-of-god:  'As to what they are, they are of the kindred ofthe Gods and the Fathers, valiant men, and guest-cherishing:  richhave they been, and now are poor:  and their poverty cometh of thesesame felons, who mastered them by numbers not to be withstood.  As towhere they dwell:  when I say the name of their dwelling-place menmock at me, as if I named some valley in the moon:  yet came I toBurgdale thence in one day across the mountain-necks led by sureguides, and I tell thee that the name of their abode is ShadowyVale.''Yea,' said Iron-face, 'knoweth any man here of Shadowy Vale, orwhere it is?'None answered for a while; but there was an old man who was sittingon the shafts of a wain on the outskirts of the throng, and when heheard this word he asked his neighbour what the Alderman was saying,and he told him.  Then said that elder:'Give me place; for I have a word to say hereon.'  Therewith hearose, and made his way to the front of the ring of men, and said:'Alderman, thou knowest me?''Yea,' said Iron-face, 'thou art called the Fiddle, because of thysweet speech and thy minstrelsy; whereof I mind me well in the timewhen I was young and thou no longer young.''So it is,' said the Fiddle.  'Now hearken!  When I was very young Iheard of a vale lying far away across the mountain-necks; a valewhere the sun shone never in winter and scantily in summer; for mysworn foster-brother, Fight-fain, a bold man and a great hunter, hadhappened upon it; and on a day in full midsummer he brought methither; and even now I see the Vale before me as in a picture; amarvellous place, well grassed, treeless, narrow, betwixt greatcliff-walls of black stone, with a green river running through ittowards a yawning gap and a huge force.  Amidst that Vale was a doom-ring of black stones, and nigh thereto a feast-hall well builded ofthe like stones, over whose door was carven the image of a wolf withred gaping jaws, and within it (for we entered into it) were stonebenches on the dais.  Thence we came away, and thither again we wentin late autumn, and so dusk and cold it was at that season, that weknew not what to call it save the valley of deep shade.  But its realname we never knew; for there was no man there to give us a name ortell us any tale thereof; but all was waste there; the wimbrellaughed across its water, the raven croaked from its crags, the eaglescreamed over it, and the voices of its waters never ceased; and thuswe left it.  So the seasons passed, and we went thither no more:  forFight-fain died, and without him wandering over the waste was irksometo me; so never have I seen that valley again, or heard men tellthereof.'Now, neighbours, have I told you of a valley which seemeth to beShadowy Vale; and this is true and no made-up story.'The Alderman nodded kindly to him, and then said to Face-of-god:'Kinsman, is this word according with what thou knowest of ShadowyVale?''Yea, on all points,' said Face-of-god; 'he hath put before me apicture of the valley.  And whereas he saith, that in his youth itwas waste, this also goeth with my knowledge thereof.  For once wasit peopled, and then was waste, and now again is it peopled.''Tell us then more of the folk thereof,' said the Alderman; 'are theymany?''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'they are not.  How might they be many,dwelling in that narrow Vale amid the wastes?  But they are valiant,both men and women, and strong and well-liking.  Once they dwelt in afair dale called Silver-dale, the name whereof will be to you as aname in a lay; and there were they wealthy and happy.  Then fell uponthem this murderous Folk, whom they call the Dusky Men; and theyfought and were overcome, and many of them were slain, and manyenthralled, and the remnant of them escaped through the passes of themountains and came back to dwell in Shadowy Vale, where theirforefathers had dwelt long and long ago; and this overthrow befellthem ten years agone.  But now their old foemen have broken out fromSilver-dale and have taken to scouring the wood seeking prey; so theyfall upon these Dusky Men as occasion serves, and slay them withoutpity, as if they were adders or evil dragons; and indeed they beworse.  And these valiant men know for certain that their foemen arenow of mind to fall upon this Dale and destroy it, as they have donewith others nigher to them.  And they will slay our men, and lie withour women against their will, and enthrall our children, and tormentall those that lie under their hands till life shall be worse thandeath to them.  Therefore, O Alderman and Wardens, and ye neighboursall, it behoveth you to take counsel what we shall do, and thatspeedily.'There was again a murmur, as of men nothing daunted, but intent ontaking some way through the coming trouble.  But no man said aughttill the Alderman spake:'When didst thou first happen upon this Earl-folk, son?''Late last autumn,' said Face-of-god.Said Iron-face:  'Then mightest thou have told us of this talebefore.''Yea,' said his son, 'but I knew it not, or but little of it, tilltwo days agone.  In the autumn I wandered in the woodland, and on thefell I happened on a few of this folk dwelling in a booth by thepine-wood; and they were kind and guest-fain with me, and gave memeat and drink and lodging, and bade me come to Shadowy Vale in thespring, when I should know more of them.  And that was I fain of; forthey are wise and goodly men.  But I deemed no more of those that Isaw there save as men who had been outlawed by their own folk fordeeds that were unlawful belike, but not shameful, and were bidingtheir time of return, and were living as they might meanwhile.  Butof the whole Folk and their foemen knew I no more than ye did, tilltwo days agone, when I met them again in Shadowy Vale.  Also I thinkbefore long ye shall see their chieftain in Burgstead, for he hath aword for us.  Lastly, my mind it is that those brown-clad men whohelped Hall-face and his company in the wood were nought but men ofthis Earl-kin seeking their foemen; for indeed they told me that theyhad come upon a battle in the woodland wherein they had slain theirfoemen.  Now have I told you all that ye need to know concerningthese matters.'Again was there silence as Iron-face sat pondering a question for hisson; then a goodman of the Upper Dale, Gritgarth to wit, spake andsaid:'Gold-mane mine, tell us how many is this folk; I mean theirfighting-men?''Well asked, neighbour,' said Iron-face.Said Face-of-god:  'Their fighting-men of full age may be five score;but besides that there shall be some two or three score of women thatwill fight, whoever says them nay; and many of these are little worsein the field than men; or no worse, for they shoot well in the bow.Moreover, there will be a full score of swains not yet twenty wintersold whom ye may not hinder to fight if anything is a-doing.''This is no great host,' said the Alderman; 'yet if they deem thereis little to lose by fighting, and nought to gain by sitting still,they may go far in winning their desire; and that more especially ifthey may draw into their quarrel some other valiant Folk more innumber than they be.  I marvel not, though, they were kind to thee,son Gold-mane, if they knew who thou wert.''They knew it,' said Face-of-god.'Neighbours,' said the Alderman, 'have ye any rede hereon, and aughtto say to back your rede?'Then spake the Fiddle:  'As ye know and may see, I am now very old,and, as the word goes, unmeet for battle:  yet might I get me to thefield, either on mine own legs or on the legs of some four-footbeast, I would strike, if it were but one stroke, on these pests ofthe earth.  And, Alderman, meseemeth we shall do amiss if we bid notthe Earl-folk of Shadowy Vale to be our fellows in arms in thisadventure.  For look you, how few soever they be, they will be sureto know the ways of our foemen, and the mountain passes, and thesurest and nighest roads across the necks and the mires of the waste;and though they be not a host, yet shall they be worth a host to us?'When men heard his words they shouted for joy of them; for hatred ofthe Dusky Men who should so mar their happy life in the Dale wasgrowing up in them, and the more that hatred waxed, the more waxedtheir love of those valiant ones.Now Red-coat of Waterless spake again:  he was a big man, both talland broad, ruddy-faced and red-haired, some forty winters old.  Hesaid:'Life hath been well with us of the Lower Dale, and we deem that wehave much to lose in losing it.  Yet ill would the bargain be to buylife with thralldom:  we have been over-merry hitherto for that.Therefore I say, to battle!  And as to these men, these well-wishersof Face-of-god, if they also are minded for battle with our foes, wewere fools indeed if we did not join them to our company, were theybut one score instead of six.'Men shouted again, and they said that Red-coat had spoken well.  Thenone after other the goodmen of the Dale came and gave their word forfellowship in arms with the Men of Shadowy Vale, if there were suchas Face-of-god had said, which they doubted not; and amongst themthat spake were Fox of Nethertown, and Warwell, and Gritgarth, andBearswain, and Warcliff, and Hart of Highcliff, and Worm ofWillowholm, and Bullsbane, and Highneb of the Marsh:  all these werestout men-at-arms and men of good counsel.Last of all the Alderman spake and said:'As to the war, that must we needs meet if all be sooth that we haveheard, and I doubt it not.'Now therefore let us look to it like wise men while time yet serves.Ye shall know that the muster of the Dalesmen will bring under shieldeight long hundreds of men well-armed, and of the Shepherd-Folk fourhundreds, and of the Woodlanders two hundreds; and this is a goodlyhost if it be well ordered and wisely led.  Now am I your Aldermanand your Doomster, and I can heave up a sword as well as anothermaybe, nor do I think that I shall blench in the battle; yet Imisdoubt me that I am no leader or orderer of men-of-war:  thereforeye will do wisely to choose a wiser man-at-arms than I be for yourWar-leader; and if at the Great Folk-mote, when all the Houses andKindreds are gathered, men yeasay your choosing, then let him abide;but if they naysay it, let him give place to another.  For timepresses.  Will ye so choose?''Yea, yea!' cried all men.'Good is that, neighbours,' said the Alderman.  'Whom will ye havefor War-leader?  Consider well.'Short was their rede, for every man opened his mouth and cried out'Face-of-god!'  Then said the Alderman:'The man is young and untried; yet though he is so near akin to me, Iwill say that ye will do wisely to take him; for he is both deft ofhis hands and brisk; and moreover, of this matter he knoweth morethan all we together.  Now therefore I declare him your War-leadertill the time of the Great Folk-mote.'Then all men shouted with great glee and clashed their weapons; butsome few put their heads together and spake apart a little while, andthen one of them, Red-coat of Waterless to wit, came forward andsaid:  'Alderman, some of us deem it good that Stone-face, the oldman wise in war and in the ways of the Wood, should be named as acounsellor to the War-leader; and Hall-face, a very brisk and strongyoung man, to be his right hand and sword-bearer.''Good is that,' said Iron-face.  'Neighbours, will ye have it so?'This also they yeasaid without delay, and the Alderman declaredStone-face and Hall-face the helpers of Face-of-god in this business.Then he said:'If any hath aught to say concerning what is best to be done at once,it were good that he said it now before all and not to murmur andgrudge hereafter.'None spake save the Fiddle, who said:  'Alderman and War-leader, onething would I say:  that if these foemen are anywise akin to thoseoverrunners of the Folks of whom the tales went in my youth (for Ialso as well as Stone-face mind me well of those tales concerningthem), it shall not avail us to sit still and await their onset.  Forthen may they not be withstood, when they have gathered head andburst out and over the folk that have been happy, even as the watersthat overtop a dyke and cover with their muddy ruin the deep greengrass and the flower-buds of spring.  Therefore my rede is, as soonas may be to go seek these folk in the woodland and wheresoever elsethey may be wandering.  What sayest thou, Face-of-god?''My rede is as thine,' said he; 'and to begin with, I do now callupon ten tens of good men to meet me in arms at the beginning ofWildlake's Way to-morrow morning at daybreak; and I bid my brotherHall-face to summon such as are most meet thereto.  For this I deemgood, that we scour the wood daily at present till we hear freshtidings from them of Shadowy Vale, who are nigher than we to thefoemen.  Now, neighbours, are ye ready to meet me?'Then all shouted, 'Yea, we will go, we will go!'Said the Alderman:  'Now have we made provision for the war in thatwhich is nearest to our hands.  Yet have we to deal with the matterof the fellowship with the Folk whom Face-of-god hath seen.  This isa matter for thee, son, at least till the Great Folk-mote is holden.Tell me then, shall we send a messenger to Shadowy Vale to speak withthis folk, or shall we abide the chieftain's coming?''By my rede,' said Face-of-god, 'we shall abide his coming:  forfirst, though I might well make my way thither, I doubt if I couldgive any the bearings, so that he could come there without me; andbelike I am needed at home, since I am become War-leader.  Moreover,when your messenger cometh to Shadowy Vale, he may well chance tofind neither the chieftain there, nor the best of his men; for whilesare they here, and whiles there, as they wend following after theDusky Men.''It is well, son,' said the Alderman, 'let it be as thou sayest:soothly this matter must needs be brought before the Great Folk-mote.Now will I ask if any other hath any word to say, or any rede to givebefore this Gate-thing sundereth?'But no man came forward, and all men seemed well content and of goodheart; and it was now well past noontide.CHAPTER XXVI.  THE ENDING OF THE GATE-THINGBut just as the Alderman was on the point of rising to declare thebreaking-up of the Thing, there came a stir in the throng and itopened, and a warrior came forth into the innermost of the ring ofmen, arrayed in goodly glittering War-gear; clad in such wise that atunicle of precious gold-wrought web covered the hauberk all but thesleeves thereof, and the hem of it beset with blue mountain-stonessmote against the ankles and well-nigh touched the feet, shod withsandals gold-embroidered and gemmed.  This warrior bore a goodlygilded helm on the head, and held in hand a spear with gold-garlandedshaft, and was girt with a sword whose hilts and scabbard both wereadorned with gold and gems:  beardless, smooth-cheeked, exceedingfair of face was the warrior, but pale and somewhat haggard-eyed:and those who were nearby beheld and wondered; for they saw thatthere was come the Bride arrayed for war and battle, as if she were amessenger from the House of the Gods, and the Burg that endureth forever.Then she fell to speech in a voice which at first was somewhat hoarseand broken, but cleared as she went on, and she said:'There sittest thou, O Alderman of Burgdale!  Is Face-of-god thy sonanywhere nigh, so that he can hear me?'But Iron-face wondered at her word, and said:  'He is beside thee, ashe should be.'  For indeed Face-of-god was touching her, shoulder toshoulder.  But she looked not to the right hand nor the left, butsaid:'Hearken, Iron-face!  Chief of the House of the Face, Alderman of theDale, and ye also, neighbours and goodmen of the Dale:  I am a womancalled the Bride, of the House of the Steer, and ye have heard that Ihave plighted my troth to Face-of-god to wed with him, to love him,and lie in his bed.  But it is not so:  we are not troth-plight; norwill I wed with him, nor any other, but will wend with you to thewar, and play my part therein according to what might is in me; norwill I be worser than the wives of Shadowy Vale.'Face-of-god heard her words with no change of countenance; but Iron-face reddened over all his face, and stared at her, and knit hisbrows and said:'Maiden, what are these words?  What have we done to thee?  Have Inot been to thee as a father, and loved thee dearly?  Is not my songoodly and manly and deft in arms?  Hath it not ever been the wont ofthe House of the Face to wed in the House of the Steer? and in thesetwo Houses there hath never yet been a goodlier man and a loveliermaiden than are ye two.  What have we done then?''Ye have done nought against me,' she said, 'and all that thou sayestis sooth; yet will I not wed with Face-of-god.'Yet fiercer waxed the face of the Alderman, and he said in a loudvoice:'But how if I tell thee that I will speak with thy kindred of theSteer, and thou shalt do after my bidding whether thou wilt orwhether thou wilt not?''And how will ye compel me thereto?' she said.  'Are there thralls inthe Dale?  Or will ye make me an outlaw?  Who shall heed it?  Or Ishall betake me to Shadowy Vale and become one of their warrior-maidens.'Now was the Alderman's face changing from red to white, and belike heforgat the Thing, and what he was doing there, and he cried out:'This is an evil day, and who shall help me?  Thou, Face-of-god, whathast thou to say?  Wilt thou let this woman go without a word?  Whathath bewitched thee?'But never a word spake his son, but stood looking straight forward,cold and calm by seeming.  Then turned Iron-face again to the Bride,and said in a softer voice:'Tell me, maiden, whom I erst called daughter, what hath befallen,that thou wilt leave my son; thou who wert once so kind and loving tohim; whose hand was always seeking his, whose eyes were everfollowing his; who wouldst go where he bade, and come when he called.What hath betid that ye have cast him out, and flee from our House?'She flushed red beneath her helm and said:'There is war in the land, and I have seen it coming, and that thingsshall change around us.  I have looked about me and seen men happyand women content, and children weary for mere mirth and joy.  And Ihave thought, in a day, or two days or three, all this shall bechanged, and the women shall be, some anxious and wearied withwaiting, some casting all hope away; and the men, some shall comeback to the garth no more, and some shall come back maimed anduseless, and there shall be loss of friends and fellows, and mirthdeparted, and dull days and empty hours, and the children wanderingabout marvelling at the sorrow of the house.  All this I saw beforeme, and grief and pain and wounding and death; and I said:  Shall Ibe any better than the worst of the folk that loveth me?  Nay, thisshall never be; and since I have learned to be deft with mine handsin all the play of war, and that I am as strong as many a man, and ashardy-hearted as any, I will give myself to the Warrior and the Godof the Face; and the battle-field shall be my home, and the after-grief of the fight my banquet and holiday, that I may bear the burdenof my people, in the battle and out of it; and know every sorrow thatthe Dale hath; and cast aside as a grievous and ugly thing the bed ofthe warrior that the maiden desires, and the toying of lips and handsand soft words of desire, and all the joy that dwelleth in the Castleof Love and the Garden thereof; while the world outside is sick andsorry, and the fields lie waste and the harvest burneth.  Even sohave I sworn, even so will I do.'Her eyes glittered and her cheek was flushed, and her voice was clearand ringing now; and when she ended there arose a murmur of praisefrom the men round about her.  But Iron-face said coldly:'These are great words; but I know not what they mean.  If thou wiltto the field and fight among the carles (and that I would not naysay,for it hath oft been done and praised aforetime), why shouldest thounot go side by side with Face-of-god and as his plighted maiden?'The light which the sweetness of speech had brought into her face haddied out of it now, and she looked weary and hapless as she answeredhim slowly:'I will not wed with Face-of-god, but will fare afield as a virgin ofwar, as I have sworn to the Warrior.'Then waxed Iron-face exceeding wroth, and he rose up before all menand cried loudly and fiercely:'There is some lie abroad, that windeth about us as the gossamers inthe lanes of an autumn morning.'And therewith he strode up to Face-of-god as though he had nought todo with the Thing; and he stood before him and cried out at him whileall men wondered:'Thou! what hast thou done to turn this maiden's heart to stone?  Whois it that is devising guile with thee to throw aside this worthywedding in a worthy House, with whom our sons are ever wont to wed?Speak, tell the tale!'But Face-of-god held his peace and stood calm and proud before allmen.Then the blood mounted to Iron-face's head, and he forgat folk andkindred and the war to come, and he cried so that all the place rangwith the words of his anger:'Thou dastard!  I see thee now; it is thou that hast done this, andnot the maiden; and now thou hast made her bear a double burden, andset her on to speak for thee, whilst thou standest by saying nought,and wilt take no scruple's weight of her shame upon thee!'But his son spake never a word, and Iron-face cried:  'Out on thee!I know thee now, and why thou wouldest not to the West-land lastwinter.  I am no fool; I know thee.  Where hast thou hidden thestranger woman?'Therewith he drew forth his sword and hove it aloft as if to hew downFace-of-god, who spake not nor flinched nor raised a hand from hisside.  But the Bride threw herself in front of Gold-mane, while therearose an angry cry of 'The Peace of the Holy Thing!  Peace-breaking,peace-breaking!' and some cried, 'For the War-leader, the War-leader!' and as men could for the press they drew forth their swords,and there was tumult and noise all over the Thing-stead.But Stone-face caught hold of the Alderman's right arm and draggeddown the sword, and the big carle, Red-coat of Waterless, came upbehind him and cast his arms about his middle and drew him back; andpresently he looked around him, and slowly sheathed his sword, andwent back to his place and sat him down; and in a little while thenoise abated and swords were sheathed, and men waxed quiet again, andthe Alderman arose and said in a loud voice, but in the wonted way ofthe head man of the Thing:'Here hath been trouble in the Holy Thing; a violent man hathtroubled it, and drawn sword on a neighbour; will the neighbours givethe dooming hereof into the hands of the Alderman?'Now all knew Iron-face, and they cried out, 'That will we.'  So hespake again:'I doom the troubler of the Peace of the Holy Thing to pay a fine, towit double the blood-wite that would be duly paid for a full-grownfreeman of the kindreds.'Then the cry went up and men yeasaid his doom, and all said that itwas well and fairly doomed; and Iron-face sat still.But Stone-face stood forth and said:'Here have been wild words in the air; and dreams have taken shapeand come amongst us, and have bewitched us, so that friends and kinhave wrangled.  And meseemeth that this is through the wizardry ofthese felons, who, even dead as they are, have cast spells over us.Good it were to cast them into the Death Tarn, and then to get to ourwork; for there is much to do.'All men yeasaid that; and Forkbeard of Lea went with those who hadborne the corpses thither to cast them into the black pool.But the Fiddle spake and said:'Stone-face sayeth sooth.  O Alderman, thou art no young man, yet amI old enough to be thy father; so will I give thee a rede, and saythis:  Face-of-god thy son is no liar or dastard or beguiler, but heis a young man and exceeding goodly of fashion, well-spoken and kind;so that few women may look on him and hear him without desiring hiskindness and love, and to such men as this many things happen.Moreover, he hath now become our captain, and is a deft warrior withhis hands, and as I deem, a sober and careful leader of men;therefore we need him and his courage and his skill of leading.  Sorage not against him as if he had done an ill deed not to beforgiven--whatever he hath done, whereof we know not--for life islong before him, and most like we shall still have to thank him formany good deeds towards us.  As for the maiden, she is both lovelyand wise.  She hath a sorrow at her heart, and we deem that we knowwhat it is.  Yet hath she not lied when she said that she would bearthe burden of the griefs of the people.  Even so shall she do; andwhether she will, or whether she will not, that shall heal her owngriefs.  For to-morrow is a new day.  Therefore, if thou do after myrede, thou wilt not meddle betwixt these twain, but wilt remember allthat we have to do, and that war is coming upon us.  And when that isover, we shall turn round and behold each other, and see that we arenot wholly what we were before; and then shall that which were hardto forgive, be forgotten, and that which is remembered be easy toforgive.'So he spake; and Iron-face sat still and put his left hand to hisbeard as one who pondereth; but the Bride looked in the face of theold man the Fiddle, and then she turned and looked at Gold-mane, andher face softened, and she stood before the Alderman, and bent downbefore him and held out both her hands to him the palms upward.  Thenshe said:  'Thou hast been wroth with me, and I marvel not; for thyhope, and the hope which we all had, hath deceived thee.  But kindindeed hast thou been to me ere now:  therefore I pray thee take itnot amiss if I call to thy mind the oath which thou swearedst on theHoly Boar last Yule, that thou wouldst not gainsay the prayer of anyman if thou couldest perform it; therefore I bid thee naysay notmine:  and that is, that thou wilt ask me no more about this matter,but wilt suffer me to fare afield like any swain of the Dale, and todeal so with my folk that they shall not hinder me.  Also I pray theethat thou wilt put no shame upon Face-of-god my playmate and mykinsman, nor show thine anger to him openly, even if for a littlewhile thy love for him be abated.  No more than this will I ask ofthee.'All men who heard her were moved to the heart by her kindness and thesweetness of her voice, which was like to the robin singing suddenlyon a frosty morning of early winter.  But as for Gold-mane, his heartwas smitten sorely by it, and her sorrow and her friendliness grievedhim out of measure.But Iron-face answered after a little while, speaking slowly andhoarsely, and with the shame yet clinging to him of a man who hasbeen wroth and has speedily let his wrath run off him.  So he said:'It is well, my daughter.  I have no will to forswear myself; norhast thou asked me a thing which is over-hard.  Yet indeed I wouldthat to-day were yesterday, or that many days were worn away.'Then he stood up and cried in a loud voice over the throng:'Let none forget the muster; but hold him ready against the time thatthe Warden shall come to him.  Let all men obey the War-leader, Face-of-god, without question or delay.  As to the fine of the peace-breaker, it shall be laid on the altar of the God at the Great Folk-mote.  Herewith is the Thing broken up.'Then all men shouted and clashed their weapons, and so sundered, andwent about their business.And the talk of men it was that the breaking of the troth-plightbetween those twain was ill; for they loved Face-of-god, and as forthe Bride they deemed her the Dearest of the kindreds and the Jewelof the Folk, and as if she were the fairest and the kindest of allthe Gods.  Neither did the wrath of Iron-face mislike any; but theysaid he had done well and manly both to be wroth and to let his wrathrun off him.  As to the war which was to come, they kept a good heartabout it, and deemed it as a game to be played, wherein they mightshow themselves deft and valiant, and so get back to their merry lifeagain.So wore the day through afternoon to even and night.CHAPTER XXVII.  FACE-OF-GOD LEADETH A BAND THROUGH THE WOODNext morning tryst was held faithfully, and an hundred and a halfwere gathered together on Wildlake's Way; and Face-of-god orderedthem into three companies.  He made Hall-face leader over the firstone, and bade him hold on his way northward, and then to make forBoars-bait and see if he should meet with anything thereabout wherethe battle had been.  Red-coat of Waterless he made captain of thesecond band; and he had it in charge to wend eastward along the edgeof the Dale, and not to go deep into the wood, but to go as far as hemight within the time appointed, toward the Mountains.  Furthermore,he bade both Hall-face and Red-coat to bring their bands back toWildlake's Way by the morrow at sunset, where other goodmen should become to take the places of their men; and then if he and his companywere back again, he would bid them further what to do; but if not, asseemed likely, then Hall-face's band to go west toward the Shepherdcountry half a day's journey, and so back, and Red-coat's east alongthe Dale's lip again for the like time, and then back, so that theremight be a constant watch and ward of the Dale kept against theFelons.All being ordered Gold-mane led his own company north-east throughthe thick wood, thinking that he might so fare as to come nigh toSilver-dale, or at least to hear tidings thereof.  This intent hetold to Stone-face, but the old man shook his head and said:'Good is this if it may be done; but it is not for everyone to godown to Hell in his lifetime and come back safe with a tale thereof.However, whither thou wilt lead, thither will I follow, thoughassured death waylayeth us.'And the old carle was joyous and proud to be on this adventure, andsaid, that it was good indeed that his foster-son had with him a manwell stricken in years, who had both seen many things, and learnedmany, and had good rede to give to valiant men.So they went on their ways, and fared very warily when they weregotten beyond those parts of the wood which they knew well.  By thistime they were strung out in a long line; and they noted their roadcarefully, blazing the trees on either side when there were trees,and piling up little stone-heaps where the trees failed them.  ForStone-face said that oft it befell men amidst the thicket and thewaste to be misled by wights that begrudged men their lives, so thatthey went round and round in a ring which they might not depart fromtill they died; and no man doubted his word herein.All day they went, and met no foe, nay, no man at all; nought but thewild things of the wood; and that day the wood changed little aboutthem from mile to mile.  There were many thickets across their roadwhich they had to go round about; so that to the crow flying over thetree-tops the journey had not been long to the place where night cameupon them, and where they had to make the wood their bedchamber.That night they lighted no fire, but ate such cold victual as theymight carry with them; nor had they shot any venison, since they hadwith them more than enough; they made little noise or stir thereforeand fell asleep when they had set the watch.On the morrow they arose betimes, and broke their fast and went theirways till noon:  by then the wood had thinned somewhat, and there waslittle underwood betwixt the scrubby oak and ash which were prettynigh all the trees about:  the ground also was broken, and here andthere rocky, and they went into and out of rough little dales, mostof which had in them a brook of water running west and southwest; andnow Face-of-god led his men somewhat more easterly; and still forsome while they met no man.At last, about four hours after noon, when they were going lesswarily, because they had hitherto come across nothing to hinder them,rising over the brow of a somewhat steep ridge, they saw down in thevalley below them a half score of men sitting by the brook-sideeating and drinking, their weapons lying beside them, and along withthem stood a woman with her hands tied behind her back.They saw at once that these men were of the Felons, so they that hadtheir bows bent, loosed at them without more ado, while the othersran in upon them with sword and spear.  The felons leapt up and ranscattering down the dale, such of them as were not smitten by theshafts; but he who was nighest to the woman, ere he ran, turned andcaught up a sword from the ground and thrust it through her, and thenext moment fell across the brook with an arrow in his back.No one of the felons was nimble enough to escape from the fleet-foothunters of Burgdale, and they were all slain there to the number ofeleven.But when they came back to the woman to tend her, she breathed herlast in their hands:  she was a young and fair woman, black-hairedand dark-eyed.  She had on her body a gown of rich web, but noughtelse:  she had been bruised and sore mishandled, and the Burgdalecarles wept for pity of her, and for wrath, as they straightened herlimbs on the turf of the little valley.  They let her lie there alittle, whilst they searched round about, lest there should be anyother poor soul needing their help, or any felon lurking thereby; butthey found nought else save a bundle wherein was another rich gownand divers woman's gear, and sundry rings and jewels, and therewithalthe weapons and war-gear of a knight, delicately wrought after theWestland fashion:  these seemed to them to betoken other foul deedsof these murder-carles.  So when they had abided a while, they laidthe dead woman in mould by the brook-side, and buried with her theother woman's attire and the knight's gear, all but his sword andshield, which they had away with them:  then they cast the carcassesof the felons into the brake, but brought away their weapons and thesilver rings from their arms, which they wore like all the others ofthem whom they had fallen in with; and so went on their way to thenorth-east, full of wrath against those dastards of the Earth.It was hard on sunset when they left the valley of murder, and theywent no long way thence before they must needs make stay for thenight; and when they had arrayed their sleeping-stead the moon wasup, and they saw that before them lay the close wood again, for theyhad made their lair on the top of a little ridge.There then they lay, and nought stirred them in the night, andbetimes on the morrow they were afoot, and entered the abovesaidthicket, wherein two of them, keen hunters, had been aforetime, buthad not gone deep into it.  Through this wood they went all daytoward the north-east, and met nought but the wild things therein.At last, when it was near sunset, they came out of the thicket into asmall plain, or shallow dale rather, with no great trees in it, butthorn-brakes here and there where the ground sank into hollows; alittle river ran through the midst of it, and winded round about aheight whose face toward the river went down sheer into the water,but away from it sank down in a long slope to where the thick woodbegan again:  and this height or burg looked well-nigh west.Thitherward they went; but as they were drawing nigh to the river,and were on the top of a bent above a bushy hollow between them andthe water, they espied a man standing in the river near the bank, whosaw them not, because he was stooping down intent on something in thebank or under it:  so they gat them speedily down into the hollowwithout noise, that they might get some tidings of the man.Then Face-of-god bade his men abide hidden under the bushes and stoleforward quietly up the further bank of the hollow, his target on hisarm and his spear poised.  When he was behind the last bush on thetop of the bent he was within half a spear-cast of the water and theman; so he looked on him and saw that he was quite naked except for aclout about his middle.Face-of-god saw at once that he was not one of the Dusky Men; he wasa black-haired man, but white-skinned, and of fair stature, thoughnot so tall as the Burgdale folk.  He was busied in tickling trouts,and just as Face-of-god came out from the bush into the westeringsunlight, he threw up a fish on to the bank, and looked uptherewithal, and beheld the weaponed man glittering, and uttered acry, but fled not when he saw the spear poised for casting.Then Face-of-god spake to him and said:  'Come hither, Woodsman! wewill not harm thee, but we desire speech of thee:  and it will notavail thee to flee, since I have bowmen of the best in the hollowyonder.'The man put forth his hands towards him as if praying him to forbearcasting, and looked at him hard, and then came dripping from out thewater, and seemed not greatly afeard; for he stooped down and pickedup the trouts he had taken, and came towards Face-of-god stringingthe last-caught one through the gills on to the withy whereon werethe others:  and Face-of-god saw that he was a goodly man of somethirty winters.Then Face-of-god looked on him with friendly eyes and said:'Art thou a foemen? or wilt thou be helpful to us?'He answered in the speech of the kindreds with the hoarse voice of amuch weather-beaten man:'Thou seest, lord, that I am naked and unarmed.''Yet may'st thou bewray us,' said Face-of-god.  'What man art thou?'Said the man:  'I am the runaway thrall of evil men; I have fled fromRose-dale and the Dusky Men.  Hast thou the heart to hurt me?''We are the foemen of the Dusky Men,' said Face-of-God; 'wilt thouhelp us against them?'The man knit his brows and said:  'Yea, if ye will give me your wordnot to suffer me to fall into their hands alive.  But whence artthou, to be so bold?'Said Face-of-god:  'We are of Burgdale; and I will swear to thee onthe edge of the sword that thou shalt not fall alive into the handsof the Dusky Men.''Of Burgdale have I heard,' said the man; 'and in sooth thou seemestnot such a man as would bewray a hapless man.  But now had I bestbring you to some lurking-place where ye shall not be easily found ofthese devils, who now oft-times scour the woods hereabout.'Said Face-of-god:  'Come first and see my fellows; and then if thouthinkest we have need to hide, it is well.'So the man went side by side with him towards their lair, and as theywent Gold-mane noted marks of stripes on his back and sides, andsaid:  'Sorely hast thou been mishandled, poor man!'Then the man turned on him and said somewhat fiercely:  'Said I notthat I had been a thrall of the Dusky Men? how then should I haveescaped tormenting and scourging, if I had been with them for butthree days?'As he spake they came about a thorn-bush, and there were the Burgdalemen down in the hollow; and the man said:  'Are these thy fellows?Call to mind that thou hast sworn by the edge of the sword not tohurt me.''Poor man!' said Face-of-god; 'these are thy friends, unless thoubewrayest us.'Then he cried aloud to his folk:  'Here is now a good hap! this is arunaway thrall of the Dusky Men; of him shall we hear tidings; socherish him all ye may.'So the carles thronged about him and bestirred themselves to helphim, and one gave him his surcoat for a kirtle, and another cast acloak about him; and they brought him meat and drink, such as theyhad ready to hand:  and the man looked as if he scarce believed inall this, but deemed himself to be in a dream.  But presently heturned to Face-of-god and said:'Now I see so many men and weapons I deem that ye have no need toskulk in caves to-night, though I know of good ones:  yet shall ye dowell not to light a fire till moon-setting; for the flame ye maylightly hide, but the smoke may be seen from far aloof.'But they bade him to meat, and he needed no second bidding but atelustily, and they gave him wine, and he drank a great draught andsighed as for joy.  Then he said in a trembling voice, as though hefeared a naysay:'If ye are from Burgdale ye shall be faring back again presently; andI pray you to take me with you.'Said Face-of-god:  'Yea surely, friend, that will we do, and rejoicein thee.'Then he drank another cup which Warcliff held out to him, and spakeagain:  'Yet if ye would abide here till about noon to-morrow, ormayhappen a little later, I would bring other runaways to see you;and them also might ye take with you:  ye may think when ye see themthat ye shall have small gain of their company; for poor wretchedfolk they be, like to myself.  Yet since ye seek for tidings, hereinmight they do you more service than I; for amongst them are some whocame out of the hapless Dale within this moon; and it is six monthssince I escaped.  Moreover, though they may look spent and outwornnow, yet if ye give them a little rest, and feed them well, theyshall yet do many a day's work for you:  and I tell you that if yetake them for thralls, and put collars on their necks, and use themno worse than a goodman useth his oxen and his asses, beating themnot save when they are idle or at fault, it shall be to them as ifthey were come to heaven out of hell, and to such goodhap as theyhave not thought of, save in dreams, for many and many a day.  Andthus I entreat you to do because ye seem to me to be happy andmerciful men, who will not begrudge us this happiness.'The carles of Burgdale listened eagerly to what he said, and theylooked at him with great eyes and marvelled; and their hearts weremoved with pity towards him; and Stone-face said:'Herein, O War-leader, need I give thee no rede, for thou mayst seeclearly that all we deem that we should lose our manhood and becomethe dastards of the Warrior if we did not abide the coming of thesepoor men, and take them back to the Dale, and cherish them.''Yea,' said Wolf of Whitegarth, 'and great thanks we owe to this manthat he biddeth us this:  for great will be the gain to us if webecome so like the Gods that we may deliver the poor from misery.Now must I needs think how they shall wonder when they come toBurgdale and find out how happy it is to dwell there.''Surely,' said Face-of-god, 'thus shall we do, whatever cometh of it.But, friend of the wood, as to thralls, there be none such in theDale, but therein are all men friends and neighbours, and even soshall ye be.'And he fell a-musing, when he bethought him of how little he hadknown of sorrow.But that man, when he beheld the happy faces of the Burgdalers, andhearkened to their friendly voices, and understood what they said,and he also was become strong with the meat and drink, he bowed hishead adown and wept a long while; and they meddled not with him, tillhe turned again to them and said:'Since ye are in arms, and seem to be seeking your foemen, I supposeye wot that these tyrants and man-quellers will fall upon you inBurgdale ere the summer is well worn.''So much we deem indeed,' said Face-of-god, 'but we were fain to hearthe certainty of it, and how thou knowest thereof.'Said the man:  'It was six moons ago that I fled, as I have told you;and even then it was the common talk amongst our masters that therewere fair dales to the south which they would overrun.  Man would sayto man:  We were over many in Silver-dale, and we needed morethralls, because those we had were lessening, and especially thewomen; now are we more at ease in Rose-dale, though we have sentthralls to Silver-dale; but yet we can bear no more men from thenceto eat up our stock from us:  let them fare south to the happy dales,and conquer them, and we will go with them and help therein, whetherwe come back to Rose-dale or no.  Such talk did I hear then with mineown ears:  but some of those whom I shall bring to you to-morrowshall know better what is doing, since they have fled from Rose-dalebut a few days.  Moreover, there is a man and a woman who have fledfrom Silver-dale itself, and are but a month from it, journeying allthe time save when they must needs hide; and these say that theirmasters have got to know the way to Burgdale, and are minded for itbefore the winter, as I said; and nought else but the ways thither dothey desire to know, since they have no fear.'By then was night come, and though the moon was high in heaven, andlighted all that waste, the Burgdalers must needs light a fire forcooking their meat, whatsoever that woodsman might say; moreover, thenight was cold and somewhat frosty.  A little before they had come tothat place they had shot a fat buck and some smaller deer, but ofother meat they had no great store, though there was wine enough.  Sothey lit their fire in the thickest of the thorn-bush to hide it allthey might, and thereat they cooked their venison and the troutswhich the runaway had taken, and they fell to, and ate and drank andwere merry, making much of that poor man till him-seemed he wasgotten into the company of the kindest of the Gods.But when they were full, Face-of-god spake to him, and asked him hisname; and he named himself Dallach; but said he:  'Lord, this isaccording to the naming of men in Rose-dale before we wereenthralled:  but now what names have thralls?  Also I am notaltogether of the blood of them of Rose-dale, but of better and morewarrior-like kin.'Said Face-of-god:  'Thou hast named Silver-dale; knowest thou it?'Dallach answered:  'I have never seen it.  It is far hence; in aweek's journey, making all diligence, and not being forced to hideand skulk like those runaways, ye shall come to the mouth thereoflying west, where its rock-walls fall off toward the plain.''But,' said Face-of-god, 'is there no other way into that Dale?''Nay, none that folk wot of,' said Dallach, 'except to bold cragsmenwith their lives in their hands.''Knowest thou aught of the affairs of Silver-dale?' said Face-of-god.Said Dallach:  'Somewhat I know:  we wot that but a few years agothere was a valiant folk dwelling therein, who were lords of thewhole dale, and that they were vanquished by the Dusky Men:  butwhether they were all slain and enthralled we wot not; but we deem itotherwise.  As for me it is of their blood that I am partly come; formy father's father came thence to settle in Rose-dale, and wedded awoman of the Dale, who was my father's mother.''When was it that ye fell under the Dusky Men?' said Face-of-god.Said Dallach:  'It was five years ago.  They came into the Dale agreat company, all in arms.''Was there battle betwixt you?' said Face-of-god.'Alas! not so,' said Dallach.  'We were a happy folk there; but softand delicate:  for the Dale is exceeding fertile, and beareth wealthin abundance, both corn and oil and wine and fruit, and of beasts forman's service the best that may be.  Would that there had beenbattle, and that I had died therein with those that had a heart tofight; and even so saith now every man, yea, every woman in the Dale.But it was not so when the elders met in our Council-House on the daywhen the Dusky Men bade us pay them tribute and give them houses todwell in and lands to live by.  Then had we weapons in our hands, butno hearts to use them.''What befell then?' said the goodman of Whitegarth.Said Dallach:  'Look ye to it, lords, that it befall not in Burgdale!We gave them all they asked for, and deemed we had much left.  Whatbefell, sayst thou?  We sat quiet; we went about our work in fear andtrembling, for grim and hideous were they to look on.  At first theymeddled not much with us, save to take from our houses what theywould of meat and drink, or raiment, or plenishing.  And all this wedeemed we might bear, and that we needed no more than to toil alittle more each day so as to win somewhat more of wealth.  But soonwe found that it would not be so; for they had no mind to till theteeming earth or work in the acres we had given them, or to sit atthe loom, or hammer in the stithy, or do any manlike work; it was wethat must do all that for their behoof, and it was altogether forthem that we laboured, and nought for ourselves; and our bodies wereonly so much our own as they were needful to be kept alive forlabour.  Herein were our tasks harder than the toil of any mules orasses, save for the younger and goodlier of the women, whom theywould keep fair and delicate to be their bed-thralls.'Yet not even so were our bodies safe from their malice:  for thesemen were not only tyrants, but fools and madmen.  Let alone thatthere were few days without stripes and torments to satiate theirfury or their pleasure, so that in all streets and nigh any housemight you hear wailing and screaming and groaning; but moreover,though a wise man would not willingly slay his own thrall any morethan his own horse or ox, yet did these men so wax in folly andmalice, that they would often hew at man or woman as they met them inthe way from mere grimness of soul; and if they slew them it waswell.  Thereof indeed came quarrels enough betwixt master and master,for they are much given to man-slaying amongst themselves:  but whatprofit to us thereof?  Nay, if the dead man were a chieftain, thenwoe betide the thralls! for thereof must many an one be slain on hisgrave-mound to serve him on the hell-road.  To be short:  we haveheard of men who be fierce, and men who be grim; but these we mayscarce believe us to be men at all, but trolls rather; and ill willit be if their race waxeth in the world.'The Burgdale men hearkened with all their ears, and wondered thatsuch things could befall; and they rejoiced at the work that laybefore them, and their hearts rose high at the thought of battle inthat behalf, and the fame that should come of it.  As for therunaway, they made so much of him that the man marvelled; for theydealt with him like a woman cherishing a son, and knew not how to bekind enough to him.CHAPTER XXVIII.  THE MEN OF BURGDALE MEET THE RUNAWAYSNow ere the night was far spent, Dallach arose and said:'Kind folk, ye will presently be sleeping; but I bid you keep a goodwatch, and if ye will be ruled by me, ye will kindle no fire on themorrow, for the smoke riseth thick in the morning air, and is as abeacon.  As for me, I shall leave you here to rest, and I myself willfare on mine errand.'They bade him sleep and rest him after so many toils and hardships,saying that they were not tied to an hour to be back in Burgdale; buthe said:  'Nay, the moon is high, and it is as good as daylight tome, who could find my way even by starlight; and your tarrying hereis nowise safe.  Moreover, if I could find those folk and bring thempart of the way by night and cloud it were well; for if we were takenagain, burning quick would be the best death by which we should die.As for me, now am I strong with meat and drink and hope; and when Icome to Burgdale there will be time enough for resting and slumber.'Said Face-of-god:  'Shall I not wend with thee to see these peopleand the lairs wherein they hide?'The man smiled:  'Nay, earl,' said he, 'that shall not be.  For wotye what?  If they were to see me in company of a man-at-arms theywould deem that I was bringing the foe upon them, and would flee, ormayhappen would fall upon us.  For as for me, when I saw thee, thouwert close anigh me, so I knew thee to be no Dusky Man; but theywould see the glitter of thine arms from afar, and to them allweaponed men are foemen.  Thou, lord, knowest not the heart of athrall, nor the fear and doubt that is in it.  Nay, I myself mustcast off these clothes that ye have given me, and fare naked, lestthey mistrust me.  Only I will take a spear in my hand, and sling aknife round my neck, if ye will give them to me; for if the worsthappen, I will not be taken alive.'Therewith he cast off his raiment, and they gave him the weapons andwished him good speed, and he went his way twixt moonlight andshadow; but the Burgdalers went to sleep when they had set a watch.Early in the morning they awoke, and the sun was shining and thethrushes singing in the thorn-brake, and all seemed fair andpeaceful, and a little haze still hung about the face of the burgover the river.  So they went down to the water and washed the nightfrom off them; and thence the most part of them went back to theirlair among the thorn-bushes:  but four of them went up the dale intothe oak-wood to shoot a buck, and five more they sent out to watchtheir skirts around them; and Face-of-god with old Stone-face wentover a ford of the stream, and came on to the lower slope of theburg, and so went up it to the top.  Thence they looked about to seeif aught were stirring, but they saw little save the waste and thewood, which on the north-east was thick of big trees stretching out along way.  Their own lair was clear to see over its bank and thebushes thereof, and that misliked Face-of-god, lest any foe shouldclimb the burg that day.  The morning was clear, and Face-of-godlooking north-and-by-west deemed he saw smoke rising into the airover the tree-covered ridges that hid the further distance towardthat airt, though further east uphove the black shoulders of theGreat that Waste and the snowy peaks behind them.  The said smoke wasnot such as cometh from one great fire, but was like a thin veilstaining the pale blue sky, as when men are burning ling on theheath-side and it is seen aloof.He showed that smoke to Stone-face, who smiled and said:'Now will they be lighting the cooking fires in Rose-dale:  would Iwere there with a few hundreds of axes and staves at my back!''Yea,' said Face-of-god, smiling in his face, 'but where I pray theeare these elves and wood-wights, that we meet them not?  Grim thingsthere are in the woods, and things fair enough also:  but meseemeththat the trolls and the elves of thy young years have been frightedaway.'Said Stone-face:  'Maybe, foster-son; that hath been seen ere now,that when one race of man overrunneth the land inhabited by another,the wights and elves that love the vanquished are seen no more, orget them away far off into the outermost wilds, where few men evercome.''Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'that may well be.  But deemest thou by thattoken that we shall be vanquished?''As for us, I know not,' said Stone-face; 'but thy friends of ShadowyVale have been vanquished.  Moreover, concerning these felons whomnow we are hunting, are we all so sure that they be men?  Certain itis, that when I go into battle with them, I shall smite with no morepity than my sword, as if I were smiting things that may not feel thewoes of man.'Said Face-of-god:  'Yea, even so shall it be with me.  But whatthinkest thou of these runaways?  Shall we have tidings of them, orshall Dallach bring the foe upon us?  It was for the sake of thatquestion that I have clomb the burg:  and that we might watch theland about us.''Nay,' said Stone-face, 'I have seen many men, and I deem of Dallachthat he is a true man.  I deem we shall soon have tidings of hisfellows; and they may have seen the elves and wood-wights:  I wouldfain ask them thereof, and am eager to see them.'Said Face-of-god:  'And I somewhat dread to see them, and their ragsand their misery and the weals of their stripes.  It irked me to seeDallach when he first fell to his meat last night, how he ate like adog for fear and famine.  How shall it be, moreover, when we havethem in the Dale, and they fall to the deed of kind there, as theyneeds must.  Will they not bear us evil and thrall-like men?''Maybe,' said Stone-face, 'and maybe not; for they have been thrallsbut for a little while:  and I deem that in no long time shall ye seethem much bettered by plenteous meat and rest.  And after all issaid, this Dallach bore him like a valiant man; also it was valiantof him to flee; and of the others may ye say the like.  But look you!there are men going down yonder towards our lair:  belike those shallbe our guests, and there be no Dusky Men amongst them.  Come, let ushome!'So Face-of-god looked and beheld from the height of the burg shapesof men grey and colourless creeping toward the lair from sunshine toshadow, like wild creatures shy and fearful of the hunter, or so hedeemed of them.So he turned away, angry and sad of heart, and the twain went downthe burg and across the water to their camp, having seen little totell of from the height.When they came to their campment there were their folk standing in aring round about Dallach and the other runaways.  They made way forthe War-leader and Stone-face, who came amongst them and beheld theRunaways, that they were many more than they looked to see; for theywere of carles one score and three, and of women eighteen, all toldsave Dallach.  When they saw those twain come through the ring of menand perceived that they were chieftains, some of them fell down ontheir knees before them and held out their joined hands to them, andkissed the Burgdalers' feet and the hems of their garments, while thetears streamed out of their eyes:  some stood moving little andstaring before them stupidly:  and some kept glancing from face toface of the well-liking happy Burgdale carles, though for a whileeven their faces were sad and downcast at the sight of the poor men:some also kept murmuring one or two words in their country tongue,and Dallach told Face-of-god that these were crying out for victual.It must be said of these poor folk that they were of diversconditions, and chiefly of three:  and first there were seven ofRose-dale and five of Silver-dale late come to the wood (of theseSilver-dalers Dallach had told but of two, for the other three werebut just come).  Of these twelve were seven women, and all, save twoof the women, were clad in one scanty kirtle or shirt only; for suchwas the wont of the Dusky Men with their thralls.  They had broughtaway weapons, and had amongst them six axes and a spear, and a sword,and five knives, and one man had a shield.Yet though these were clad and armed, yet in some wise were they theworst of all; they were so timorous and cringing, and most of themheavy-eyed and sullen and down-looking.  Many of them had beengrievously mishandled:  one man had had his left hand smitten off;another was docked of three of his toes, and the gristle of his noseslit up; one was halt, and four had been ear-cropped, nor did anylack weals of whipping.  Of the Silver-dale new-comers the three menwere the worst of all the Runaways, with wild wandering eyes, butsullen also, and cringing if any drew nigh, and would not look anyonein the face, save presently Face-of-god, on whom they were soon fondto fawn, as a dog on his master.  But the women who were with them,and who were well-nigh as timorous as the men, were those two gaily-dad ones, and they were soft-handed and white-skinned, save for thelast days of weather in the wood; for they had been bed-thralls ofthe Dusky Men.Such were the new-comers to the wood.  But others had been, likeDallach, months therein; it may be said that there were eighteen ofthese, carles and queens together.  Little raiment they had amongstthem, and some were all but stark naked, so that on these might wellbe seen as on Dallach the marks of old stripes, and of these alsowere there men who had been shorn of some member or other, and theywere all burnt and blackened by the weather of the woodland; yet forall their nakedness, they bore themselves bolder and more manlikethan the later comers, nor did they altogether lack weapons takenfrom their foemen, and most of them had some edge-tool or another.Of these folk were four from Silver-dale, though Dallach knew it not.Besides these were a half score and one who had been years in thewood instead of months; weather-beaten indeed were these, shaggy andrough-skinned like wild men of kind.  Some of them had madethemselves skin breeches or clouts, some went stark naked; of weaponsof the Dale had they few, but they bore bows of hazel or wych-elmstrung with deer-gut, and shafts headed with flint stones; stavesalso of the same fashion, and great clubs of oak or holly:  some ofthem also had made them targets of skin and willow-twigs, for thesewere the warriors of the Runaways:  they had a few steel knivesamongst them, but had mostly learned the craft of using sharp flintsfor knives:  but four of these were women.Three of these men were of the kindreds of the Wolf from Silver-dale,and had been in the wood for hard upon ten years, and wild as theywere, and without hope of meeting their fellows again, they wentproudly and boldly amongst the others, overtopping them by the headand more.  For the greater part of these men were somewhat short ofstature, though by nature strong and stout of body.It must be told that though Dallach had thus gotten all these manyRunaways together, yet had they not been dwelling together as onefolk; for they durst not, lest the Dusky Men should hear thereof andfall upon them, but they had kept themselves as best they could incaves and in brakes three together or two, or even faring alone asDallach did:  only as he was a strong and stout-hearted man, he wentto and fro and wandered about more than the others, so that heforegathered with most of them and knew them.  He said also that hedoubted not but that there were more Runaways in the wood, but thesewere all he could come at.  Divers who had fled had died from time totime, and some had been caught and cruelly slain by their masters.They were none of them old; the oldest, said Dallach, scant of fortywinters, though many from their aspect might have been old enough.So Face-of-god looked and beheld all these poor people; and said tohimself, that he might well have dreaded that sight.  For here was hebrought face to face with the Sorrow of the Earth, whereof he hadknown nought heretofore, save it might be as a tale in a minstrel'ssong.  And when he thought of the minutes that had made the hours,and the hours that had made the days that these men had passedthrough, his heart failed him, and he was dumb and might not speak,though he perceived that the men of Burgdale looked for speech fromhim; but he waved his hand to his folk, and they understood him, forthey had heard Dallach say that some of them were crying for victual.So they set to work and dighted for them such meat as they had, andthey set them down on the grass and made themselves their carvers andserving-men, and bade them eat what they would of such as there was.Yet, indeed, it grieved the Burgdalers again to note how these folkwere driven to eat; for they themselves, though they were merry folk,were exceeding courteous at table, and of great observance ofmanners:  whereas these poor Runaways ate, some of them like hungrydogs, and some hiding their meat as if they feared it should be takenfrom them, and some cowering over it like falcons, and scarce anywith a manlike pleasure in their meal.  And, their eating over, themore part of them sat dull and mopish, and as if all things wereforgotten for the time present.Albeit presently Dallach bestirred him and said to Face-of-god:'Lord of the Earl-folk, if I might give thee rede, it were best toturn your faces to Burgdale without more tarrying.  For we are over-nigh to Rose-dale, being but thus many in company.  But when we cometo our next resting-place, then shall bring thee to speech with thelast-comers from Silver-dale; for there they talk with the tongue ofthe kindreds; but we of Rose-dale for the more part talk otherwise;though in my house it came down from father to son.''Yea,' said Face-of-god, gazing still on that unhappy folk, as theysat or lay upon the grass at rest for a little while:  but him-seemedas he gazed that some memories of past time stirred in some of them;for some, they hung their heads and the tears stole out of their eyesand rolled down their cheeks.  But those older Runaways of Silver-dale were not crouched down like most of the others, but strode upand down like beasts in a den; yet were the tears on the face of oneof these.  Then Face-of-god constrained himself, and spake to thefolk, and said:  'We are now over-nigh to our foes of Rose-dale tolie here any longer, being too few to fall upon them.  We will comehither again with a host when we have duly questioned these men whohave sought refuge with us:  and let us call yonder height the Burgof the Runaways, and it shall be a landmark for us when we are on theroad to Rose-dale.'Then the Burgdalers bade the Runaways courteously and kindly to ariseand take the road with them; and by that time were their men all comein; and four of them had venison with them, which was needful, ifthey were to eat that night or the morrow, as the guests had eatenthem to the bone.So they tarried no more, but set out on the homeward way; and Face-of-god bade Dallach walk beside him, and asked him such concerningRose-dale and its Dusky Men.  Dallach told him that these were not somany as they were masterful, not being above eight hundreds of men,all fighting-men.  As to women, they had none of their own race, butlay with the Daleswomen at their will, and begat children of them;and all or most of the said children favoured the race of theirbegetters.  Of the men-children they reared most, but the women-children they slew at once; for they valued not women of their ownblood:  but besides the women of the Dale, they would go at whiles inbands to the edges of the Plain and beguile wayfarers, and bring backwith them thence women to be their bed-thralls; albeit some of thesewere bought with a price from the Westland men.As to the number of the folk of Rose-dale, its own folk, he said theywould number some five thousand souls, one with another; of whom somethousand might be fit to bear arms if they had the heart thereto, asthey had none.  Yet being closely questioned, he deemed that theymight fall on their masters from behind, if battle were joined.He said that the folk of Rose-dale had been a goodly folk before theywere enthralled, and peaceable with one another, but that now it wasa sport of the Dusky Men to set a match between their thralls tofight it out with sword and buckler or otherwise; and the vanquishedman, if he were not sore hurt, they would scourge, or shear somemember from him, or even slay him outright, if the match between theowners were so made.  And many other sad and grievous tales he toldto Face-of-god, more than need be told again; so that the War-leaderwent along sorry and angry, with his teeth set, and his hand on thesword-hilt.Thus they went till night fell on them, and they could scarce see thesigns they had made on their outward journey.  Then they made stay ina little valley, having set a watch duly; and since they were by thistime far from Rose-dale, and were a great company as regardedscattered bands of the foe, they lighted their fires and cooked theirvenison, and made good cheer to the Runaways, and so went to sleep inthe wild-wood.When morning was come they gat them at once to the road; and if theBurgdalers were eager to be out of the wood, their eagerness was asnought to the eagerness of the Runaways, most of whom could not beeasy now, and deemed every minute lost unless they were wending on tothe Dale; so that this day they were willing to get over the moreground, whereas they had not set out on their road till afternoonyesterday.Howsoever, they rested at noontide, and Face-of-god bade Dallachbring him to speech with others of the Runaways, and first that hemight talk with those three men of the kindreds who had fled fromSilver-dale in early days.  So Dallach brought them to him; but hefound that though they spake the tongue, they were so few-spoken fromwildness and loneliness, at least at first, that nought could comefrom them that was not dragged from them.These men said that they had been in the wood more than nine years,so that they knew but little of the conditions of the Dale in thatpresent day.  However, as to what Dallach had said concerning theDusky Men, they strengthened his words; and they said that the DuskyMen took no delight save in beholding torments and misery, and thatthey doubted if they were men or trolls.  They said that since theyhad dwelt in the wood they had slain not a few of the foemen,waylaying them as occasion served, but that in this warfare they hadlost two of their fellows.  When Face-of-god asked them of theirdeeming of the numbers of the Dusky Men, they said that before thosebands had broken into Rose-dale, they counted them, as far as theycould call to mind, at about three thousand men, all warriors; andthat somewhat less than one thousand had gone up into Rose-dale, andsome had died, and many had been cast away in the wild-wood, theirfellows knew not how.  Yet had not their numbers in Silver-dalediminished; because two years after they (the speakers) had fled,came three more Dusky Companies or Tribes into Silver-dale, and eachof these tribes was of three long hundreds; and with their coming hadthe cruelty and misery much increased in the Dale, so that thethralls began to die fast; and that drave the Dusky Men beyond theborders of Silver-dale, so that they fell upon Rose-dale.  When askedhow many of the kindreds might yet be abiding in Silver-dale, theirfaces clouded, and they seemed exceeding wroth, and answered, thatthey would willingly hope that most of those that had not been slainat the time of the overthrow were now dead, yet indeed they fearedthere were yet some alive, and mayhappen not a few women.By then must they get on foot again, and so the talk fell betweenthem; but when they made stay for the night, after they had donetheir meat, Face-of-god prayed Dallach bring to him some of thelatest-come folk from Silver-dale, and he brought to him the man andthe woman who had been in the Dale within that moon.  As to the man,if those of the Earl-folk had been few-spoken from fierceness andwildness, he was no less so from mere dulness and weariness ofmisery; but the woman's tongue went glibly enough, and it seemed topleasure her to talk about her past miseries.  As aforesaid, she wasbetter clad than most of those of Rose-dale, and indeed might becalled gaily clad, and where her raiment was befouled or rent, it wasfrom the roughness of the wood and its weather, and not from thethralldom.  She was a young and fair woman, black-haired and grey-eyed.  She had washed herself that day in a woodland stream whichthey had crossed on the road, and had arrayed her garments as trimlyas she might, and had plucked some fumitory, wherewith she had made agarland for her head.  She sat down on the grass in front of Face-of-god, while the man her mate stood leaning against a tree and lookedon her greedily.  The Burgdale carles drew near to her to hearken herstory, and looked kindly on the twain.  She smiled on them, butespecially on Face-of-god, and said:'Thou hast sent for me, lord, and I wot well thou wouldst hear mytale shortly, for it would be long to tell if I were to tell itfully, and bring into it all that I have endured, which has beenbitter enough, for all that ye see me smooth of skin and well-likingof body.  I have been the bed-thrall of one of the chieftains of theDusky Men, at whose house many of their great men would assemble, sothat ye may ask me whatso ye will; as I have heard much talk and maycall it to mind.  Now if ye ask me whether I have fled because of theshame that I, a free woman come of free folk, should be a mere thrallin the bed of the foes of my kin, and with no price paid for me, Imust needs say it is not so; since over long have we of the Dale beenthralls to be ashamed of such a matter.  And again, if ye deem that Ihave fled because I have been burdened with grievous toil and beendriven thereto by the whip, ye may look on my hands and my body andye will see that I have toiled little therewith:  nor again did Iflee because I could not endure a few stripes now and again; for suchusage do thralls look for, even when they are delicately kept for thesake of the fairness of their bodies, and this they may well endure;yea also, and the mere fear of death by torment now and again.  Butbefore me lay death both assured and horrible; so I took mine owncounsel, and told none for fear of bewrayal, save him who guarded me;and that was this man; who fled not from fear, but from love of me,and to him I have given all that I might give.  So we got out of thehouse and down the Dale by night and cloud, and hid for one whole dayin the Dale itself, where I trembled and feared, so that I deemed Ishould die of fear; but this man was well pleased with my company,and with the lack of toil and beating even for the day.  And in thenight again we fled and reached the wild-wood before dawn, and well-nigh fell into the hands of those who were hunting us, and hadoutgone us the day before, as we lay hid.  Well, what is to say?They saw us not, else had we not been here, but scattered piece-mealover the land.  This carle knew the passes of the wood, because hehad followed his master therein, who was a great hunter in thewastes, contrary to the wont of these men, and he had lain a night onthe burg yonder; therefore he brought me thither, because he knewthat thereabout was plenty of prey easy to take, and he had a bowwith him; and there we fell in with others of our folk who had fledbefore, and with Dallach; who e'en now told us what was hard tobelieve, that there was a fair young man like one of the Gods leadinga band of goodly warriors, and seeking for us to bring us into apeaceful and happy land; and this man would not have gone with himbecause he feared that he might fall into thralldom of other folk,who would take me away from him; but for me, I said I would go in anycase, for I was weary of the wood and its roughness and toil, andthat if I had a new master he would scarcely be worse than my old onewas at his best, and him I could endure.  So I went, and glad andglad I am, whatever ye will do with me.  And now will I answer whatsoye may ask of me.'She laid her limbs together daintily and looked fondly on Face-of-god, and the carle scowled at her somewhat at first, but presently,as he watched her, his face smoothed itself out of its wrinkles.But Face-of-god pondered a little while, and then asked the woman ifshe had heard any words to remember of late days concerning theaffairs of the Dusky Men and their intent; and he said:'I pray thee, sister, be truthful in thine answer, for somewhat liethon it.'She said:  'How could I speak aught but the sooth to thee, O lovelylord?  The last word spoken hereof I mind me well:  for my master hadbeen mishandling me, and I was sullen to him after the smart, and hemocked and jeered me, and said:  Ye women deem we cannot do withoutyou, but ye are fools, and know nothing; we are going to conquer anew land where the women are plenty, and far fairer than ye be; andwe shall leave you to fare afield like the other thralls, or work inthe digging of silver; and belike ye wot what that meaneth.  Also hesaid that they would leave us to the new tribe of their folk, farwilder than they, whom they looked for in the Dale in about a moon'swearing; so that they needs must seek to other lands.  Also this sametalk would we hear whenever it pleased any of them to mock us theirbed-thralls.  Now, my sweet lord, this is nought but the very sooth.'Again spake Face-of-god after a while:'Tell me, sister, hast thou heard of any of the Dusky Men being slainin the wood?''Yea,' she said, and turned pale therewith and caught her breath asone choking; but said in a little while:'This alone was it hard for me to tell thee amongst all the I griefsI have borne, whereof I might have told thee many tales, and will doone day if thou wilt suffer it; but fear makes this hard for me.  Forin very sooth this was the cause of my fleeing, that my master wasbrought in slain by an arrow in the wood; and he was to be borne tobale and burned in three days' wearing; and we three bed-thralls ofhis, and three of the best of the men-thralls, were to be burnedquick on his bale-fire after sore torments; therefore I fled, and hida knife in my bosom, that I might not be taken alive; but sweet waslife to me, and belike I should not have smitten myself.'And she wept sore for pity of herself before them all.  But Face-of-god said:'Knowest thou, sister, by whom the man was slain?''Nay,' she said, still sobbing; 'but I heard nought thereof, nor hadI noted it in my terror.  The death of others, who were slain beforehim, and the loss of many, we knew not how, made them more bitterlycruel with us.'And again was she weeping; but Face-of-god said kindly to her:  'Weepno more, sister, for now shall all thy troubles be over; I feel in myheart that we shall overcome these felons, and make an end of them,and there then is Burgdale for thee in its length and breadth, orthine own Dale to dwell in freely.''Nay,' she said, 'never will I go back thither!' and she turned roundto him and kissed his feet, and then arose and turned a little towardher mate; and the carle caught her by the hand and led her away, andseemed glad so to do.So once again they fell asleep in the woods, and again the nextmorning fared on their way early that they might come into Burgdalebefore nightfall.  When they stayed a while at noontide and ate,Face-of-god again had talk with the Runaways, and this time withthose of Rose-dale, and he heard much the same story from them thathe had heard before, told in divers ways, till his heart was sickwith the hearing of it.On this last day Face-of-god led his men well athwart the wood, sothat he hit Wildlake's Way without coming to Carl-stead; and he camedown into the Dale some four hours after noon on a bright day oflatter March.  At the ingate to the Dale he found watches set, themen whereof told him that the tidings were not right great.  Hall-face's company had fallen in with a band of the Felons three score innumber in the oak-wood nigh to Boars-bait, and had slain some andchased the rest, since they found it hard to follow them home as theyran for the tangled thicket:  of the Burgdalers had two been slainand five hurt in this battle.As for Red-coat's company, they had fallen in with no foemen.CHAPTER XXIX.  THEY BRING THE RUNAWAYS TO BURGSTEADSo now being out of the wood, they went peaceably and safely alongthe Portway, the Runaways mingling with the Dalesmen.  Strange showedamidst the health and wealth of the Dale the rags and misery andnakedness of the thralls, like a dream amidst the trim gaiety ofspring; and whomsoever they met, or came up with on the road, whatsohis business might be, could not refrain himself from following them,but mingled with the men-at-arms, and asked them of the tidings; andwhen they heard who these poor people were, even delivered thralls ofthe Foemen, they were glad at heart and cried out for joy; and manyof the women, nay, of the men also, when they first came across thatmisery from out the heart of their own pleasant life, wept for pityand love of the poor folk, now at last set free, and blessed theswords that should do the like by the whole people.They went slowly as men began to gather about them; yea, some of thegood folk that lived hard by must needs fare home to their houses tofetch cakes and wine for the guests; and they made them sit down andrest on the green grass by the side of the Portway, and eat and drinkto cheer their hearts; others, women and young swains, while theyrested went down into the meadows and plucked of the spring flowers,and twined them hastily with deft and well-wont fingers into chapletsand garlands for their heads and bodies.  Thus indeed they coveredtheir nakedness, till the lowering faces and weather-beaten skins ofthose hardly-entreated thralls looked grimly out from amidst theknots of cowslip and oxlip, and the branches of the milk-whiteblackthorn bloom, and the long trumpets of the daffodils, of the huethat wrappeth round the quill which the webster takes in hand whenshe would pleasure her soul with the sight of the yellow growing uponthe dark green web.So they went on again as the evening was waning, and when they weregotten within a furlong of the Gate, lo! there was come theminstrelsy, the pipe and the tabor, the fiddle and the harp, and thefolk that had learned to sing the sweetest, both men and women, andRedesman at the head of them all.Then fell the throng into an ordered company; first went the music,and then a score of Face-of-god's warriors with drawn swords anduplifted spears; and then the flower-bedecked misery of the Runaways,men and women going together, gaunt, befouled, and hollow-eyed, withhere and there a flushed cheek or gleaming eye, or tear-bedewed face,as the joy and triumph of the eve pierced through their wontedweariness of grief; then the rest of the warriors, and lastly themingled crowd of Dalesfolk, tall men and fair women gaily arrayed,clean-faced, clear-skinned, and sleek-haired, with glancing eyes andruddy lips.And now Redesman turned about to the music and drew his bow acrosshis fiddle, and the other bows ran out in concert, and the harpsfollowed the story of them, and he lifted up his voice and sang thewords of an old song, and all the singers joined him and blendedtheir voices with his.  And these are some of the words which theysang:Lo! here is Spring, and all we are living,   We that were wan with Winter's fear;Reach out your hands to her hands that are giving,   Lest ye lose her love and the light of the year.Many a morn did we wake to sorrow,   When low on the land the cloud-wrath lay;Many an eve we feared to-morrow,   The unbegun unfinished day.Ah we--we hoped not, and thou wert tardy;   Nought wert thou helping; nought we prayed.Where was the eager heart, the hardy?   Where was the sweet-voiced unafraid?But now thou lovest, now thou leadest,   Where is gone the grief of our minds?What was the word of the tale, that thou heedest   E'en as the breath of the bygone winds?Green and green is thy garment growing   Over thy blossoming limbs beneath;Up o'er our feet rise the blades of thy sowing,   Pierced are our hearts with thine odorous breath.But where art thou wending, thou new-comer?   Hurrying on to the Courts of the Sun?Where art thou now in the House of the Summer?   Told are thy days and thy deed is done.Spring has been here for us that are living   After the days of Winter's fear;Here in our hands is the wealth of her giving,   The Love of the Earth, and the Light of the Year.Thus came they to the Gate, and lo! the Bride thereby, leaningagainst a buttress, gazing with no dull eyes at the coming throng.She was now clad in her woman's attire again, to wit a light flame-coloured gown over a green kirtle; but she yet bore a gilded helm onher head and a sword girt to her side in token of her oath to theGod.  She had been in Hall-face's company in that last battle, andhad done a man's service there, fighting very valiantly, but had notbeen hurt, and had come back to Burgstead when the shift of men was.Now she drew herself up and stood a little way before the Gate andlooked forth on the throng, and when her eyes beheld the Runawaysamidst of the weaponed carles of Burgdale, her face flushed, and hereyes filled with tears as she stood, partly wondering, partly deemingwhat they were.  She waited till Stone-face came by her, and then shetook the old man by the sleeve, and drew him apart a little and saidto him:  'What meaneth this show, my friend?  Who hath clad thesefolk thus strangely; and who be these three naked tall ones, sofierce-looking, but somewhat noble of aspect?'For indeed those three men of the kindreds, when they had gotten intothe Dale, and had rested them, and drunk a cup of wine, and when theyhad seen the chaplets and wreaths of the spring-flowers wherewiththey were bedecked, and had smelt the sweet savour of them, fell towalking proudly, heeding not their nakedness; for no rag had theyupon them save breech-clouts of deer-skin:  they had changed weaponswith the Burgdale carles; and one had gotten a great axe, which hebore over his shoulder, and the shaft thereof was all done about withcopper; and another had shouldered a long heavy thrusting-spear, andthe third, an exceeding tall man, bore a long broad-bladed war-sword.Thus they went, brown of skin beneath their flower-garlands, theirlong hair bleached by the sun falling about their shoulders; highthey strode amongst the shuffling carles and tripping women of thelater-come thralls.  But when they heard the music, and saw that theywere coming to the Gate in triumph, strange thoughts of old memoriesswelled up in their hearts, and they refrained them not from weeping,for they felt that the joy of life had come back to them.Nor must it be deemed that these were the only ones amongst theRunaways whose hearts were cheered and softened:  already were manyof them coming back to life, as they felt their worn bodies caressedby the clear soft air of Burgdale, and the sweetness of the flowersthat hung about them, and saw all round about the kind and happyfaces of their well-willers.So Stone-face looked on the Bride as she stood with face yet tear-bedewed, awaiting his answer, and said:'Daughter, thou sayest who clad these folk thus?  It was misery thathath so dight them; and they are the images of what we shall be if welove foul life better than fair death, and so fall into the hands ofthe Felons, who were the masters of these men.  As for the tall nakedmen, they are of our own blood, and kinsmen to Face-of-god's newfriends; and they are of the best of the vanquished:  it was in earlydays that they fled from thralldom; as we may have to do.  Now,daughter, I bid thee be as joyous as thou art valiant, and then shallall be well.'Therewith she smiled on him, and he departed, and she stood a littlewhile, as the throng moved on and was swallowed by the Gate, andlooked after them; and for all her pity for the other folk, shethought chiefly of those fearless tall men who were of the blood ofthose with whom it was lawful to wed.There she stood as the wind dried the tears upon her cheeks, thinkingof the sorrow which these folk had endured, and their stripes andmocking, their squalor and famine; and she wondered and looked on herown fair and shapely hands with the precious finger-rings thereon,and on the dainty cloth and trim broidery of her sleeve; and shetouched her smooth cheek with the back of her hand, and smiled, andfelt the spring sweet in her mouth, and its savour goodly in hernostrils; and therewith she called to mind the aspect of her lovelybody, as whiles she had seen it imaged, all its full measure, in theclear pool at midsummer, or piece-meal, in the shining steel of theWestland mirror.  She thought also with what joy she drew the breathof life, yea, even amidst of grief, and of how sweet and pure andwell-nurtured she was, and how well beloved of many friends and thewhole folk, and she set all this beside those woeful bodies andlowering faces, and felt shame of her sorrow of heart, and the painit had brought to her; and ever amidst shame and pity of all thatmisery rose up before her the images of those tall fierce men, and itseemed to her as if she had seen something like to them in some dreamor imagination of her mind.So came the Burgdalers and their guests into the street of Burgsteadamidst music and singing; and the throng was great there.  Then Face-of-god bade make a ring about the strangers, and they did so, and heand the Runaways alone were in the midst of it; and he spake in aloud voice and said:'Men of the Dale and the Burg, these folk whom here ye see in such asorry plight are they whom our deadly foes have rejoiced to torment;let us therefore rejoice to cherish them.  Now let those men comeforth who deem that they have enough and more, so that they may eachtake into their houses some two or three of these friends such aswould be fain to be together.  And since I am War-leader, and havethe right hereto, I will first choose them whom I will lead into theHouse of the Face.  And lo you! will I have this man (and he laid hishand on Dallach),who is he whom I first came across, and who found usall these others, and next I will have yonder tall carles, the threeof them, because I perceive them to be men meet to be with a War-leader, and to follow him in battle.'Therewith he drew the three Men of the Wolf towards him, but Dallachalready was standing beside him.  And folk rejoiced in Face-of-god.But the Bride came forward next, and spake to him meekly and simply:'War-leader, let me have of the women those who need me most, that Imay bring them to the House of the Steer, and try if there be notsome good days yet to be found for them, wherein they shall butremember the past grief as an ugly dream.'Then Face-of-god looked on her, and him-seemed he had never seen herso fair; and all the shame wherewith he had beheld her of late wasgone from him, and his heart ran over with friendly love towards heras she looked into his face with kindly eyes; and he said:'Kinswoman, take thy choice as thy kindness biddeth, and happy shallthey be whom thou choosest.'She bowed her head soberly, and chose from among the guests fourwomen of the saddest and most grievous, and no man of their kindredspake for going along with them; then she went her ways home, leadingone of them by the hand, and strange was it to see those twain goingthrough sun and shade together, that poor wretch along with thegoodliest of women.Then came forward one after other of the worthy goodmen of the Dale,and especially such as were old, and they led away one one man, andanother two, and another three, and often would a man crave to gowith a woman or a woman with a man, and it was not gainsaid them.  Sowere all the guests apportioned, and ill-content were those goodmenthat had to depart without a guest; and one man would say to another:'Such-an-one, be not downcast; this guest shall be between us, if hewill, and shall dwell with thee and me month about; but this firstmonth with me, since I was first comer.'  And so forth was it said.Now to prevent the time to come, it may be said about the Runaways,that when they had been a little while amongst the Burgdalers, wellfed and well clad and kindly cherished, it was marvellous how theywere bettered in aspect of body, and it began to be seen of them thatthey were well-favoured people, and divers of the women exceedinggoodly, black-haired and grey-eyed, and very clear-skinned and white-skinned; most of them were young, and the oldest had not seen aboveforty winters.  They of Rose-dale, and especially such as had firstfled away to the wood, were very soon seen to be merry and kindlyfolk; but they who had been longest in captivity, and notably thosefrom Silver-dale who were not of the kindreds, were for a long timesullen and heavy, and it availed little to trust to them for thedoing of work; albeit they would follow about their friends ofBurgdale with the love of a dog; also they were, divers of them,somewhat thievish, and if they lacked anything would liefer take itby stealth than ask for it; which forsooth the Burgdale men took notamiss, but deemed of it as a jest rather.Very few of the Runaways had any will to fare back to their oldhomes, or indeed could be got to go into the wood, or, after a day ortwo, to say any word of Rose-dale or Silver-dale.  In this and othermatters the Burgdalers dealt with them as with children who must havetheir way; for they deemed that their guests had much time to makeup; also they were well content when they saw how goodly they were,for these Dalesmen loved to see men goodly of body and of a cheerfulcountenance.As for Dallach and the three Silver-dale men of the kindred, theywent gladly whereas the Burgdale men would have them; and half ascore others took weapons in their hands when the war was foughten:concerning which more hereafter.But on the even whereof the tale now tells, Face-of-god and Stone-face and their company met after nightfall in the Hall of the Faceclad in glorious raiment, and therewith were Dallach and the men ofSilver-dale, washen and docked of their long hair, after the fashionof warriors who bear the helm; and they were clad in gay attire, withbattle-swords girt to their sides and gold rings on their arms.Somewhat stern and sad-eyed were those Silver-dalers yet, though theylooked on those about them kindly and courteously when they met theireyes; and Face-of-god yearned towards them when he called to mind thebeauty and wisdom and loving-kindness of the Sun-beam.  They were, asaforesaid, strong men and tall, and one of them taller than anyamidst that house of tall men.  Their names were Wolf-stone, thetallest, and God-swain, and Spear-fist; and God-swain the youngestwas of thirty winters, and Wolf-stone of forty.  They came into theHall in such wise, that when they were washed and attired, and allmen were assembled in the Hall, and the Alderman and the chieftainssitting on the dais, Face-of-god brought them in from the out-bower,holding Dallach by the right hand and Wolf-stone by the left; and helooked but a stripling beside that huge man.And when the men in the Hall beheld such goodly warriors, andremembered their grief late past, they all stood up and shouted forjoy of them.  But Face-of-god passed up the Hall with them, and stoodbefore the dais and said:'O Alderman of the Dale and Chief of the House of the Face, here Ibring to you the foes of our foemen, whom I have met in the Wild-wood, and bidden to our House; and meseemeth they will be ourfriends, and stand beside us in the day of battle.  Therefore I say,take these guests and me together, or put us all to the doortogether; and if thou wilt take them, then show them to such placesas thou deemest meet.'Then stood up the Alderman and said:'Men of Silver-dale and Rose-dale, I bid you welcome!  Be ye ourfriends, and abide here with us as long as seemeth good to you, andshare in all that is ours.  Son Face-of-god, show these warriors toseats on the dais beside thee, and cherish them as well as thouknowest how.'Then Face-of-god brought them up on to the dais and sat down on theright hand of his father, with Dallach on his right hand, and thenWolf-stone out from him; then sat Stone-face, that there might be aman of the Dale to talk with them and serve them; and on his righthand first Spear-fist and then God-swain.  And when they were all satdown, and the meat was on the board, Iron-face turned to his sonFace-of-god and took his hand, and said in a loud voice, so that manymight hear him:'Son Face-of-god, son Gold-mane, thou bearest with thee both ill luckand good.  Erewhile, when thou wanderedst out into the Wild-wood,seeking thou knewest not what from out of the Land of Dreams, thoudidst but bring aback to us grief and shame; but now that thou hastgone forth with the neighbours seeking thy foemen, thou hast comeaback to us with thine hands full of honour and joy for us, and wethank thee for thy gifts, and I call thee a lucky man.  Herewith,kinsman, I drink to thee and the lasting of thy luck.'Therewith he stood up and drank the health of the War-leader and theGuests:  and all men were exceeding joyous thereat, when they calledto mind his wrath at the Gate-thing, and they shouted for gladness asthey drank that health, and the feast became exceeding merry in theHouse of the Face; and as to the war to come, it seemed to them as ifit were over and done in all triumph.CHAPTER XXX.  HALL-FACE GOETH TOWARD ROSE-DALEOn the morrow Face-of-god took counsel with Hall-face and Stone-faceas to what were best to be done, and they sat on the dais in the Hallto talk it over.Short was the time that had worn since that day in Shadowy Vale, forit was but eight days since then; yet so many things had befallen inthat time, and, to speak shortly, the outlook for the Burgdalers hadchanged so much, that the time seemed long to all the three, andespecially to Face-of-god.It was yet twenty days till the Great Folk-mote should beholden, andto Hall-face the time seemed long enough to do somewhat, and hedeemed it were good to gather force and fall on the Dusky Men inRose-dale, since now they had gotten men who could lead them thenighest way and by the safest passes, and who knew all the ways ofthe foemen.  But to Stone-face this rede seemed not so good; for theywould have to go and come back, and fight and conquer, in less timethan twenty days, or be belated of the Folk-mote, and meanwhile muchmight happen.'For,' said Stone-face, 'we may deem the fighting-men of Rose-dale tobe little less than one thousand, and however we fall on them, evenif it be unawares at first, they shall fight stubbornly; so that wemay not send against them many less than they be, and that shallstrip Burgdale of its fighting-men, so that whatever befalls, we thatbe left shall have to bide at home.'Now was Face-of-god of the same mind as Stone-face; and he saidmoreover:  'When we go to Rose-dale we must abide there a whileunless we be overthrown.  For if ye conquer it and come away at once,presently shall the tidings come to the ears of the Dusky Men inSilver-dale, and they shall join themselves to those of Rose-dale whohave fled before you, and between them they shall destroy the unhappypeople therein; for ye cannot take them all away with you:  and thatshall they do all the more now, when they look to have new thralls inBurgdale, both men and women.  And this we may not suffer, but mustabide till we have met all our foemen and have overcome them, so thatthe poor folk there shall be safe from them till they have learnedhow to defend their dale.  Now my rede is, that we send out the War-arrow at once up and down the Dale, and to the Shepherds andWoodlanders, and appoint a day for the Muster and Weapon-show of allour Folk, and that day to be the day before the Spring Market, thatis to say, four days before the Great Folk-mote, and meantime that wekeep sure watch about the border of the wood, and now and again scourthe wood, so as to clear the Dale of their wandering bands.''Yea,' said Hall-face; 'and I pray thee, brother, let me have anhundred of men and thy Dallach, and let us go somewhat deep into thewood towards Rose-dale, and see what we may come across; peradventureit might be something better than hart or wild-swine.'Said Face-of-god:  'I see no harm therein, if Dallach goeth with theefreely; for I will have no force put on him or any other of theRunaways.  Yet meseemeth it were not ill for thee to find the road toRose-dale; for I have it in my mind to send a company thither to givethose Rose-dale man-quellers somewhat to do at home when we fall uponSilver-dale.  Therefore go find Dallach, and get thy men together atonce; for the sooner thou art gone on thy way the better.  But this Ibid thee, go no further than three days out, that ye may be back homebetimes.'At this word Hall-face's eyes gleamed with joy, and he went out fromthe Hall straightway and sought Dallach, and found him at the Gate.Iron-face had given him a new sword, a good one, and had bidden himcall it Thicket-clearer, and he would not leave it any moment of theday or night, but would lay it under his pillow at night as a childdoes with a new toy; and now he was leaning against a buttress anddrawing the said sword half out of the scabbard and poring over itsblade, which was indeed fair enough, being wrought with dark greywaving lines like the eddies of the Weltering Water.So Hall-face greeted him, and smiled and said:'Guest, if thou wilt, thou may'st take that new blade of my father'swork which thou lovest so, a journey which shall rejoice it.''Yea,' said Dallach, 'I suppose that thou wouldest fare on thybrother's footsteps, and deemest that I am the man to lead thee onthe road, and even farther than he went; and though it might bethought by some that I have seen enough of Rose-dale and the partsthereabout for one while, yet will I go with thee; for now am I a managain, body and soul.'And therewith he drew Thicket-clearer right out of his sheath andwaved him in the air.  And Hall-face was glad of him and said he waswell apaid of his help.  So they went away together to gather men,and on the morrow Hall-face departed and went into the Wild-wood withDallach and an hundred and two score men.But as for Face-of-god, he fared up and down the Dale following theWar-arrow, and went into all houses, and talked with the folk, bothyoung and old, men and women, and told them closely all that hadbetid and all that was like to betide; and he was well pleased withthat which he saw and heard; for all took his words well, and werenought afeard or dismayed by the tidings; and he saw that they wouldnot hang aback.  Meantime the days wore, and Hall-face came not backtill the seventh day, and he brought with him twelve more Runaways,of whom five were women.  But he had lost four men, and had with himDallach and five others of the Dalesmen borne upon litters sore hurt;and this was his story:They got to the Burg of the Runaways on the forenoon of the thirdday, and thereby came on five carles of the Runaways--men who hadmissed meeting Dallach that other day, but knew what had been done;for one of them had been sick and could not come with him, and he hadtold the others:  so now they were hanging about the Burg of theRunaways hoping somewhat that he might come again; and they met theBurgdalers full of joy, and brought them trouts that they had caughtin the river.As for the other runaways, namely, five women and two more carles--they had gotten them close to the entrance into Silver-dale, where bynight and cloud they came on a campment of the Dusky Men, who wereleading home these seven poor wretches, runaways whom they hadcaught, that they might slay them most evilly in Rose-stead.  SoHall-face fell on the Dusky Men, and delivered their captives, butslew not all the foe, and they that fled brought pursuers on them whocame up with them the next day, so near was Rose-dale, though theymade all diligence homeward.  The Burgdalers must needs turn andfight with those pursuers, and at last they drave them aback so thatthey might go on their ways home.  They let not the grass growbeneath their feet thereafter, till they were assured by meeting aband of the Woodlanders, who had gone forth to help them, and withwhom they rested a little.  But neither so were they quite done withthe foemen, who came upon them next day a very many:  these howeverthey and the Woodlanders, who were all fresh and unwounded and veryvaliant, speedily put to the worse; and so they came on to Burgstead,leaving those of them who were sorest hurt to be tended by theWoodlanders at Carlstead, who, as might be looked for, deal with themvery lovingly.It was in the first fight that they suffered that loss of slain andwounded; and therein the newly delivered thralls fought valiantlyagainst their masters:  as for Dallach, it was no marvel, said Hall-face, that he was hurt; but rather a marvel that he was not slain, solittle he recked of point and edge, if he might but slay the foemen.Such was Hall-face's-tale; and Face-of-god deemed that he had doneunwisely to let him go that journey; for the slaying of a few DuskyMen was but a light gain to set against the loss of so manyBurgdalers; yet was he glad of the deliverance of those Runaways, anddeemed it a gain indeed.  But henceforth would he hold all still tillhe should have tidings of Folk-might; so nought was done thereaftersave the warding of the Dale, from the country of the Shepherds tothe Waste above the Eastern passes.But Face-of-god himself went up amongst the Shepherds, and abode witha goodman hight Hound-under-Greenbury, who gathered to him the folkfrom the country-side, and they went up on to Greenbury, and sat onthe green grass while he spoke with them and told them, as he hadtold the others, what had been done and what should be done.  Andthey heard him gladly, and he deemed that there would be no blenchingin them, for they were all in one tale to live and die with theirfriends of Burgdale, and they said that they would have no other wordsave that to bear to the Great Folk-mote.So he went away well-pleased, and he fared on thence to theWoodlanders, and guested at the house of a valiant man hightWargrove, who on the morrow morn called the folk together to a greenlawn of the Wild-wood, so that there was scarce a soul of them thatwas not there.  Then he laid the whole matter before them; and if theDalesmen had been merry and ready, and the Shepherds stout-heartedand friendly, yet were the Wood-landers more eager still, so thatevery hour seemed long to them till they stood in their war-gear; andthey told him that now at last was the hour drawing nigh which theyhad dreamed of, but had scarce dared to hope for, when the lost wayshould be found, and the crooked made straight, and that which hadbeen broken should be mended; that their meat and drink, and sleepingand waking, and all that they did were now become to them but themeans of living till the day was come whereon the two remnants of thechildren of the Wolf should meet and become one Folk to live or dietogether.Then went Face-of-god back to Burgstead again, and as he stood anighthe Thing-stead once more, and looked down on the Dale as he hadbeheld it last autumn, he bethought him that with all that had beendone and all that had been promised, the earth was clearing of hertrouble, and that now there was nought betwixt him and the happy daysof life which the Dale should give to the dwellers therein, save thegathering hosts of the battle-field and the day when the last wordshould be spoken and the first stroke smitten.  So he went down on tothe Portway well content.Thereafter till the day of the Weapon-show there is nought to tellof, save that Dallach and the other wounded men began to grow wholeagain; and all men sat at home, or went on the woodland ward,expecting great tidings after the holding of the Folk-mote.CHAPTER XXXI.  OF THE WEAPON-SHOW OF THE MEN OF BURGDALE AND THEIRNEIGHBOURSNow on the day appointed for the Weapon-show came the Folk flock-mealto the great and wide meadow that was cleft by Wildlake as it ran tojoin the Weltering Water.  Early in the morning, even before sunrise,had the wains full of women and children begun to come thither.  Alsothere came little horses and asses from the Shepherd country with oneor two or three damsels or children sitting on each, and by wain-sideor by beast strode the men of the house, merry and fair in their war-gear.  The Woodlanders, moreover, man and woman, elder and swain andyoung damsel, streamed out of the wood from Carlstead, eager to makethe day begin before the sunrise, and end before his setting.Then all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of wains; forthe April sun was hot in the Dale, and when he arose the meads weregay with more than the spring flowers; for the tents and the tiltswere stained and broidered with many colours, and there was none whohad not furbished up his war-gear so that all shone and glittered.And many wore gay surcoats over their armour, and the women were cladin all their bravery, and the Houses mostly of a suit; for one boreblue and another corn-colour, and another green, and another brazil,and so forth, and all gleaming and glowing with broidery of gold andbright hues.  But the women of the Shepherds were all clad in white,embroidered with green boughs and red blossoms, and the Woodlandwomen wore dark red kirtles.  Moreover, the women had set garlands offlowers on their heads and the helms of the men, and for the mostpart they were slim of body and tall and light-limbed, and as daintyto look upon as the willow-boughs that waved on the brook-side.Thither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought theirguests, even now much bettered by their new soft days; and much thepoor folk marvelled at all this joyance, and they scarce knew wherethey were; but to some it brought back to their minds days of joyancebefore the thralldom and all that they had lost, so that their heartswere heavy a while, till they saw the warriors of the kindredsstreaming into the mead and bethought them why they carried steel.Now by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on thePortway, and this was the folk of the Burg on their way to theWeapon-mead.  The men-at-arms were in the midst of the throng, and atthe head of them was the War-leader, with the banner of the Facebefore him, wherein was done the image of the God with the ray-ringedhead.  But at the rearward of the warriors went the Alderman and theBurg-wardens, before whom was borne the banner of the Burg picturedwith the Gate and its Towers; but in the midst betwixt those two wasthe banner of the Steer, a white beast on a green field.So when the Dale-wardens who were down in the meadow heard the musicand beheld who were coming, they bade the companies of the Dale andthe Shepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to pitch theirbanners in a half circle about the ingle of the meadow which was madeby the streams of Wildlake and the Weltering Water, and gather tothem to be ordered there under their leaders of scores and half-hundreds and hundreds; and even so they did.  But the banners of theDale without the Burg were the Bridge, and the Bull, and the Vine,and the Sickle.  And the Shepherds had three banners, to witGreenbury, and the Fleece, and the Thorn.As for the Woodlanders, they said that they were abiding their greatbanner, but it should come in good time; 'and meantime,' said they,'here are the war-tokens that we shall fight under; for they are goodenough banners for us poor men, the remnant of the valiant of timepast.'  Therewith they showed two great spears, and athwart the onewas tied an arrow, its point dipped in blood, its feathers singedwith fire; and they said, 'This is the banner of the War-shaft.'On the other spear there was nought; but the head thereof was greatand long, and they had so burnished the steel that the sun smote outa ray of light from it, so that it might be seen from afar.  And theysaid:  'This is the Banner of the Spear!  Down yonder where theravens are gathering ye shall see a banner flying over us.  Thereshall fall many a mother's son.'Smiled the Dale-wardens, and said that these were good banners tofight under; and those that stood nearby shouted for the valiancy ofthe Woodland Carles.Now the Dale-wardens went to the entrance from the Portway to themeadow, and there met the Men of the Burg, and two of them went oneon either side of the War-leader to show him to his seat, and theothers abode till the Alderman and Burg-wardens came up, and thenjoined themselves to them, and the horns blew up both in the meadowand on the road, and the new-comers went their ways to theirappointed places amidst the shouts of the Dalesmen; and the women andchildren and old men from the Burg followed after, till all the meadwas covered with bright raiment and glittering gear, save within thering of men at the further end.So came the War-leader to his seat of green turf raised in the ingleaforesaid; and he stood beside it till the Alderman and Wardens hadtaken their places on a seat behind him raised higher than his; belowhim on the step of his seat sat the Scrivener with his pen and ink-horn and scroll of parchment, and men had brought him a smooth shieldwhereon to write.On the left side of Face-of-god stood the men of the Face allglittering in their arms, and amongst them were Wolf-stone and histwo fellows, but Dallach was not yet whole of his hurts.  On hisright were the folk of the House of the Steer:  the leader of thatHouse was an old white-bearded man, grandfather of the Bride, for herfather was dead; and who but the Bride herself stood beside him inher glorious war-gear, looking as if she were new come from the Cityof the Gods, thought most men; but those who beheld her closelydeemed that she looked heavy-eyed and haggard, as if she were aweary.Nevertheless, wheresoever she passed, and whosoever looked on her(and all men looked on her), there arose a murmur of praise and love;and the women, and especially the young ones, said how fair her deedwas, and how meet she was for it; and some of them were for doing onwar-gear and faring to battle with the carles; and of these some weresober and solemn, as was well seen afterwards, and some spakelightly:  some also fell to boasting of how they could run and climband swim and shoot in the bow, and fell to baring of their arms toshow how strong they were:  and indeed they were no weaklings, thoughtheir arms were fair.There then stood the ring of men, each company under its banner; andbeyond them stood the women and children and men unmeet for battle;and beyond them again the tilted wains and the tents.Now Face-of-god sat him down on the turf-seat with his bright helm onhis head and his naked sword across his knees, while the horns blewup loudly, and when they had done, the elder of the Dale-wardenscried out for silence.  Then again arose Face-of-god and said:'Men of the Dale, and ye friends of the Shepherds, and ye, O valiantWoodlanders; we are not assembled here to take counsel, for in threedays' time shall the Great Folk-mote be holden, whereat shall becounsel enough.  But since I have been appointed your Chief and War-leader, till such time as the Folk-mote shall either yeasay or naysaymy leadership, I have sent for you that we may look each other in theface and number our host and behold our weapons, and see if we bemeet for battle and for the dealing with a great host of foemen.  Fornow no longer can it be said that we are going to war, but ratherthat war is on our borders, and we are blended with it; as many havelearned to their cost; for some have been slain and some sorely hurt.Therefore I bid you now, all ye that are weaponed, wend past us thatthe tale of you may be taken.  But first let every hundred-leader andhalf-hundred-leader and score-leader make sure that he hath his talearight, and give his word to the captain of his banner that he inturn may give it out to the Scrivener with his name and the House andCompany that he leadeth.'So he spake and sat him adown; and the horns blew again in token thatthe companies should go past; and the first that came was Hall-wardof the House of the Steer, and the first of those that went after himwas the Bride, going as if she were his son.So he cried out his name, and the name of his House, and said, 'Anhundred and a half,' and passed forth, his men following him in mostgoodly array.  Each man was girt with a good sword and bore a longheavy spear over his shoulder, save a score who bare bows; and no manlacked a helm, a shield, and a coat of fence.Then came a goodly man of thirty winters, and stayed before theScrivener and cried out:'Write down the House of the Bridge of the Upper Dale at one hundred,and War-well their leader.'And he strode on, and his men followed clad and weaponed like thoseof the Steer, save that some had axes hanging to their girdlesinstead of swords; and most bore casting-spears instead of the longspears, and half a score were bowmen.Then came Fox of Upton leading the men of the Bull of Middale, anhundred and a half lacking two; very great and tall were his men, andthey also bore long spears, and one score and two were bowmen.Then Fork-beard of Lea, a man well on in years, led on the men of theVine, an hundred and a half and five men thereto; two score of thembare bow in hand and were girt with sword; the rest bore their swordsnaked in their right hands, and their shields (which were but smallbucklers) hanging at their backs, and in the left hand each bore twocasting-spears.  With these went two doughty women-at-arms among thebowmen, tall and well-knit, already growing brown with the springsun, for their work lay among the stocks of the vines on thesouthward-looking bents.Next came a tall young man, yellow-haired, with a thin red beard, andgave himself out for Red-beard of the Knolls; he bore his father'sname, as the custom of their house was, but the old man, who had longbeen head man of the House of the Sickle, was late dead in his bed,and the young man had not seen twenty winters.  He bade the Scrivenerwrite the tale of the Men of the Sickle at an hundred and a half, andhis folk fared past the War-leader joyously, being one half of thembowmen; and fell shooters they were; the other half were girt withswords, and bore withal long ashen staves armed with great bladescurved inwards, which weapon they called heft-sax.All these bands, as the name and the tale of them was declared weregreeted with loud shouts from their fellows and the bystanders; butnow arose a greater shout still, as Stone-face, clad in goodlyglittering array, came forth and said:'I am Stone-face of the House of the Face, and I bring with me twohundreds of men with their best war-gear and weapons:  write it down,Scrivener!'And he strode on like a young man after those who had gone past, andafter him came the tall Hall-face and his men, a gallant sight tosee:  two score bowmen girt with swords, and the others with nakedswords waving aloft, and each bearing two casting-spears in his lefthand.Then came a man of middle age, broad-shouldered, yellow-haired, blue-eyed, of wide and ruddy countenance, and after him a goodly company;and again great was the shout that went up to the heavens; for hesaid:'Scrivener, write down that Hound-under-Greenbury, from amongst thedwellers in the hills where the sheep feed, leadeth the men who gounder the banner of Greenbury, to the tale of an hundred and fourscore.'Therewith he passed on, and his men followed, stout, stark, andmerry-faced, girt with swords, and bearing over their shoulders long-staved axes, and spears not so long as those which the Dalesmen bore;and they had but a half score of arrow-shot with them.Next came a young man, blue-eyed also, with hair the colour of flaxon the distaff, broad-faced and short-nosed, low of stature, but verystrong-built, who cried out in a loud, cheerful voice:'I am Strongitharm of the Shepherds, and these valiant men are of theFleece and the Thorn blended together, for so they would have it; andtheir tale is one hundred and two score and ten.'Then the men of those kindreds went past merry and shouting, and theywere clad and weaponed like to them of Greenbury, but had with them ascore of bowmen.  And all these Shepherd-folk wore over theirhauberks white woollen surcoats broidered with green and red.Now again uprose the cry, and there stood before the War-leader avery tall man of fifty winters, dark-faced and grey-eyed, and hespake slowly and somewhat softly, and said:'War-leader, this is Red-wolf of the Woodlanders leading the men whogo under the sign of the War-shaft, to the number of an hundred andtwo.'Then he passed on, and his men after him, tall, lean, and silentamidst the shouting.  All these men bare bows, for they were keenhunters; each had at his girdle a little axe and a wood-knife, andsome had long swords withal.  They wore, everyone of the carles,short green surcoats over their coats of fence; but amongst them werethree women who bore like weapons to the men, but were clad in redkirtles under their hauberks, which were of good ring-mail gleamingover them from throat to knee.Last came another tall man, but young, of twenty-five winters, andspake:'Scrivener, I am Bears-bane of the Woodlanders, and these that comeafter me wend under the sign of the Spear, and they are of the taleof one hundred and seven.'And he passed by at once, and his men followed him, clad and weaponedno otherwise than they of the War-shaft, and with them were twowomen.Now went all those companies back to their banners, and stood there;and there arose among the bystanders much talk concerning the Weapon-show, and who were the best arrayed of the Houses.  And of the oldmen, some spake of past weapon-shows which they had seen in theiryouth, and they set them beside this one, and praised and blamed.  Soit went on a little while till the horns blew again, and once morethere was silence.  Then arose Face-of-god and said:'Men of Burgdale, and ye Shepherd-folk, and ye of the Woodland, nowshall ye wot how many weaponed men we may bring together for thiswar.  Scrivener, arise and give forth the tale of the companies, asthey have been told unto you.'Then the Scrivener stood up on the turf-bench beside Face-of-god, andspake in a loud voice, reading from his scroll:'Of the Men of Burgdale there have passed by me nine hundreds andsix; of the Shepherds three hundreds and eight and ten; and of theWoodlanders two hundreds and nine; so that all told our men arefourteen hundreds and thirty and three.'Now in those days men reckoned by long hundreds, so that the wholetale of the host was one thousand, five hundred, and four score andone, telling the tale in short hundreds.When the tale had been given forth and heard, men shouted again, andthey rejoiced that they were so many.  For it exceeded the reckoningwhich the Alderman had given out at the Gate-thing.  But Face-of-godsaid:'Neighbours, we have held our Weapon-show; but now hold you ready,each man, for the Hosting toward very battle; for belike within sevendays shall the leaders of hundreds and twenties summon you to beready in arms to take whatso fortune may befall.  Now is sundered theWeapon-show.  Be ye as merry to-day as your hearts bid you to be.'Therewith he came down from his seat with the Alderman and theWardens, and they mingled with the good folk of the Dale and theShepherds and the Woodlanders, and merry was their converse there.It yet lacked an hour of noon; so presently they fell to and feastedin the green meadow, drinking from wain to wain and from tent totent; and thereafter they played and sported in the meads, shootingat the butts and wrestling, and trying other masteries.  Then theyfell to dancing one and all, and so at last to supper on the greengrass in great merriment.  Nor might you have known from thedemeanour of any that any threat of evil overhung the Dale.  Nay, soglad were they, and so friendly, that you might rather have deemedthat this was the land whereof tales tell, wherein people die not,but live for ever, without growing any older than when they firstcome thither, unless they be born into the land itself, and then theygrow into fair manhood, and so abide.  In sooth, both the land andthe folk were fair enough to be that land and the folk thereof.But a little after sunset they sundered, and some fared home; butmany of them abode in the tents and tilted wains, because the morrowwas the first day of the Spring Market:  and already were some of theWestland chapmen come; yea, two of them were with the bystanders inthe meadow; and more were looked for ere the night was far spent.CHAPTER XXXII.  THE MEN OF SHADOWY VALE COME TO THE SPRING MARKET ATBURGSTEADOn the morrow betimes in the morning the Westland chapmen, who werenow all come, went out from the House of the Face, where they wereever wont to be lodged, and set up their booths adown the streetbetwixt gate and bridge.  Gay was the show; for the booths weretilted over with painted cloths, and the merchants themselves wereclad in long gowns of fine cloth; scarlet, and blue, and white, andgreen, and black, with broidered welts of gold and silver; and theirknaves were gaily attired in short coats of divers hues, with silverrings about their arms, and short swords girt to their sides.  Peoplebegan to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to openingtheir bales and their packs, and unloading their wains.  There hadthey iron, both in pigs and forged scrap and nails; steel they had,and silver, both in ingots and vessel; pearls from over sea; cinnabarand other colours for staining, such as were not in the mountains:madder from the marshes, and purple of the sea, and scarlet grainfrom the holm-oaks by its edge, and woad from the deep clayey fieldsof the plain; silken thread also from the outer ocean, and rare websof silk, and jars of olive oil, and fine pottery, and scented woods,and sugar of the cane.  But gold they had none with them, for thatthey took there; and for weapons, save a few silver-gilt toys, theyhad no market.So presently they fell to chaffer; for the carles brought them littlebags of the river-borne gold, so that the weights and scales were atwork; others had with them scrolls and tallies to tell the number ofthe beasts which they had to sell, and the chapmen gave them warestherefor without beholding the beasts; for they wotted that theDalesmen lied not in chaffer.  While the day was yet young withalcame the Dalesmen from the mid and nether Dale with their wares andset up their booths; and they had with them flasks and kegs of thewine which they had to sell; and bales of the good winter-wovencloth, some grey, some dyed, and pieces of fine linen; and blades ofswords, and knives, and axes of such fashion as the Westland menused; and golden cups and chains, and fair rings set with mountain-blue stones, and copper bowls, and vessels gilt and parcel-gilt, andmountain-blue for staining.  There were men of the Shepherds alsowith such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with theneighbours.  And of the Woodlanders were four carles and a woman withpeltries and dressed deer-skins, and a few pieces of well-carvenwood-work for bedsteads and chairs and such like.Soon was the Burg thronged with folk in all its open places, and allwere eager and merry, and it could not have been told from theirdemeanour and countenance that the shadow of a grievous trouble hungover them.  True it was that every man of the Dale and the neighbourswas girt with his sword, or bore spear or axe or other weapon in hishand, and that most had their bucklers at their backs and their helmson their heads; but this was ever their custom at all meetings ofmen, not because they dreaded war or were fain of strife, but intoken that they were free men, from whom none should take the weaponswithout battle.Such were the folk of the land:  as for the chapmen, they were well-spoken and courteous, and blithe with the folk, as they well mightbe, for they had good pennyworths of them; yet they dealt with themwithout using measureless lying, as behoved folk dealing with simpleand proud people; and many was the tale they told of the tidings ofthe Cities and the Plain.There amongst the throng was the Bride in her maiden's attire, butgirt with the sword, going from booth to booth with her guests of theRunaways, and doing those poor people what pleasure she might, andgiving them gifts from the goods there, such as they set their heartson.  And the more part of the Runaways were about among the people ofthe Fair; but Dallach, being still weak, sat on a bench by the doorof the House of the Face looking on well-pleased at all the stir offolk.Hall-face was gone on the woodland ward; while Face-of-god went amongthe folk in his most glorious attire; but he soon betook him to theplace of meeting without the Gate, where Stone-face and some of theelders were sitting along with the Alderman, beside whom sat the headman of the merchants, clad in a gown of fine scarlet embroidered withthe best work of the Dale, with a golden chaplet on his head, and agood sword, golden-hilted, by his side, all which the Alderman hadgiven to it him that morning.  These chiefs were talking togetherconcerning the tidings of the Plain, and many a tale the guest toldto the Dalesmen, some true, some false.  For there had been battlesdown there, and the fall of kings, and destruction of people, as oftbefalleth in the guileful Cities.  He told them also, in answer totheir story of the Dusky Men, of how men even such-like, but ridingon horses, or drawn in wains, an host not to be numbered, haderewhile overthrown the hosts of the Cities of the Plain, and hadwrought evils scarce to be told of; and how they had piled up theskulls of slaughtered folk into great hills beside the city-gates, sothat the sun might no longer shine into the streets; and how becauseof the death and the rapine, grass had grown in the kings' chambers,and the wolves had chased deer in the Temples of the Gods.'But,' quoth he, 'I know you, bold tillers of the soil, valiantscourers of the Wild-wood, that the worst that can befall you will beto die under shield, and that ye shall suffer no torment of thethrall.  May the undying Gods bless the threshold of this Gate, andoft may I come hither to taste of your kindness!  May your race, theuncorrupt, increase and multiply, till your valiant men and cleanmaidens make the bitter sweet and purify the earth!'He spake smooth-tongued and smiling, handling the while the folds ofhis fine scarlet gown, and belike he meant a full half of what hesaid; for he was a man very eloquent of speech, and had spoken withkings, uncowed and pleased with his speaking; and for that cause andhis riches had he been made chief of the chapmen.  As he spake theheart of Face-of-god swelled within him, and his cheek flushed; butIron-face sat up straight and proud, and a light smile played abouthis face, as he said gravely:'Friend of the Westland, I thank thee for the blessing and the kindword.  Such as we are, we are; nor do I deem that the very Gods shallchange us.  And if they will be our friends, it is well; for wedesire nought of them save their friendship; and if they will be ourfoes, that also shall we bear; nor will we curse them for doing thatwhich their lives bid them to do.  What sayest thou, Face-of-god, myson?''Yea, father,' said Face-of-god, 'I say that the very Gods, thoughthey slay me, cannot unmake my life that has been.  If they do deeds,yet shall we also do.'The Outlander smiled as they spake, and bowed his head to Iron-faceand Face-of-god, and wondered at their pride of heart, marvellingwhat they would say to the great men of the Cities if they shouldmeet them.But as they sat a-talking, there came two men running to them fromthe Portway, their weapons all clattering upon them, and they heardwithal the sound of a horn winded not far off very loud and clear;and the Chapman's cheek paled:  for in sooth he doubted that war wasat hand, after all he had heard of the Dalesmen's dealings with theDusky Men.  And all battle was loathsome to him, nor for all the gainof his chaffer had he come into the Dale, had he known that war waslooked for.But the chiefs of the Dalesmen stirred not, nor changed countenance;and some of the goodmen who were in the street nigh the Gate cameforth to see what was toward; for they also had heard the voice ofthe horn.Then one of those messengers came up breathless, and stood before thechiefs, and said:'New tidings, Alderman; here be weaponed strangers come into theDale.'The Alderman smiled on him and said:  'Yea, son, and are they a greathost of men?''Nay,' said the man, 'not above a score as I deem, and there is awoman with them.''Then shall we abide them here,' said the Alderman, 'and thoumightest have saved thy breath, and suffered them to bring tidings ofthemselves; since they may scarce bring us war.  For no man desirethcertain and present death; and that is all that such a band may winat our hands in battle to-day; and all who come in peace are welcometo us.  What like are they to behold?'Said the man:  'They are tall men gloriously attired, so that theyseem like kinsmen of the Gods; and they bear flowering boughs intheir hands.'The Alderman laughed, and said:  'If they be Gods they are welcomeindeed; and they shall grow the wiser for their coming; for theyshall learn how guest-fain the Burgdale men may be.  But if, as Ideem, they be like unto us, and but the children of the Gods, thenare they as welcome, and it may be more so, and our greeting to themshall be as their greeting to us would be.'Even as he spake the horn was winded nearer yet, and more loudly, andfolk came pouring out of the Gate to learn the tidings.  Presentlythe strangers came from off the Portway into the space before theGate; and their leader was a tall and goodly man of some thirtywinters, in glorious array, helm on head and sword by side, hissurcoat green and flowery like the spring meads.  In his right handhe held a branch of the blossomed black-thorn (for some was yet inblossom), and his left had hold of the hand of an exceeding fairwoman who went beside him:  behind him was a score of weaponed men ingoodly attire, some bearing bows, some long spears, but each bearinga flowering bough in hand.The tall man stopped in the midst of the space, and the Alderman andthey with him stirred not; though, as for Face-of-god, it was to himas if summer had come suddenly into the midst of winter, and for thevery sweetness of delight his face grew pale.Then the new-comer drew nigh to the Alderman and said:'Hail to the Gate and the men of the Gate!  Hail to the kindred ofthe children of the Gods!'But the Alderman stood up and spake:  'And hail to thee, tall man!Fair greeting to thee and thy company!  Wilt thou name thyself withthine own name, or shall I call thee nought save Guest?  Welcome artthou, by whatsoever name thou wilt be called.  Here may'st thou andthy folk abide as long as ye will.'Said the new-comer:  'Thanks have thou for thy greeting and for thybidding!  And that bidding shall we take, whatsoever may come of it;for we are minded to abide with thee for a while.  But know thou, OAlderman of the Dalesmen, that I am not sackless toward thee andthine.  My name is Folk-might of the Children of the Wolf, and thiswoman is the Sun-beam, my sister, and these behind me are of mykindred, and are well beloved and trusty.  We are no evil men orwrong-doers; yet have we been driven into sore straits, wherein menmust needs at whiles do deeds that make their friends few and theirfoes many.  So it may be that I am thy foeman.  Yet, if thou doubtestof me that I shall be a baneful guest, thou shalt have our weapons ofus, and then mayest thou do thy will upon us without dread; and herefirst of all is my sword!'Therewith he cast down the flowering branch he was bearing, andpulled his sword from out his sheath, and took it by the point, andheld out the hilt to Iron-face.But the Alderman smiled kindly on him and said:'The blade is a good one, and I say it who know the craft of sword-forging; but I need it not, for thou seest I have a sword by my side.Keep your weapons, one and all; for ye have come amongst many andthose no weaklings:  and if so be that thy guilt against us is sogreat that we must needs fall on you, ye will need all your war-gear.But hereof is no need to speak till the time of the Folk-mote, whichwill be holden in three days' wearing; so let us forbear this mattertill then; for I deem we shall have enough to say of other matters.Now, Folk-might, sit down beside me, and thou also, Sun-beam, fairestof women.'Therewith he looked into her face and reddened, and said:'Yet belike thou hast a word of greeting for my son, Face-of-god,unless it be so that ye have not seen him before?'Then Face-of-god came forward, and took Folk-might by the hand andkissed him; and he stood before the Sun-beam and took her hand, andthe world waxed a wonder to him as he kissed her cheeks; and in nowise did she change countenance, save that her eyes softened, and shegazed at him full kindly from the happiness of her soul.Then Face-of-god said:  'Welcome, Guests, who erewhile guested me sowell:  now beginneth the day of your well-doing to the men ofBurgdale; therefore will we do to you as well as we may.'Then Folk-might and the Sun-beam sat them down with the chieftains,one on either side of the Alderman, but Face-of-god passed forth tothe others, and greeted them one by one:  of them was Wood-father andhis three sons, and Bow-may; and they rejoiced exceedingly to seehim, and Bow-may said:'Now it gladdens my heart to look upon thee alive and thriving, andto remember that day last winter when I met thee on the snow, andturned thee back from the perilous path to thy pleasure, which theDusky Men were besetting, of whom thou knewest nought.  Yea, it wasmerry that tide; but this is better.  Nay, friend,' she said, 'itavaileth thee nought to strive to look out of the back of thine head:let it be enough to thee that she is there.  Thou art now become agreat chieftain, and she is no less; and this is a meeting ofchieftains, and the folk are looking on and expecting demeanour ofthem as of the Gods; and she is not to be dealt with as if she werethe daughter of some little goodman with whom one hath made tryst inthe meadows.  There! hearken to me for a while; at least till I tellthee that thou seemest to me to hold thine head higher than when lastI saw thee; though that is no long time either.  Hast thou been inbattle again since that day?''Nay,' he said, 'I have stricken no stroke since I slew two felonswithin the same hour that we parted.  And thou, sister, what hastthou done?'She said:  'The grey goose hath been on the wing thrice since that,bearing on it the bane of evil things.'Then said Wood-wise:  'Kinswoman, tell him of that battle, since thouart deft with thy tongue.'She said:  'Weary on battles! it is nought save this:  twelve daysagone needs must every fighting-man of the Wolf, carle or of queen,wend away from Shadowy Vale, while those unmeet for battle we hidaway in the caves at the nether end of the Dale:  but Sun-beam wouldnot endure that night, and fared with us, though she handled noweapon.  All this we had to do because we had learned that a greatcompany of the Dusky Men were over-nigh to our Dale, and needs mustwe fall upon them, lest they should learn too much, and spread thestory.  Well, so wise was Folk-might that we came on them unawares bynight and cloud at the edge of the Pine-wood, and but one of our menwas slain, and of them not one escaped; and when the fight was overwe counted four score and ten of their arm-rings.'He said:  'Did that or aught else come of our meeting with them thatmorning?''Nay,' she said, 'nought came of it:  those we slew were but astraying band.  Nay, the four score and ten slain in the Pine-woodknew not of Shadowy Vale belike, and had no intent for it:  they werebut scouring the wood seeking their warriors that had gone out fromSilver-dale and came not aback.''Thou art wise in war, Bow-may,' said Face-of-god, and he smiledwithal.Bow-may reddened and said:  'Friend Gold-mane, dost thou perchancedeem that there is aught ill in my warring?  And the Sun-beam, shenaysayeth the bearing of weapons; though I deem that she hath littlefear of them when they come her way.'Said Face-of-god:  'Nay, I deem no ill of it, but much good.  For Isuppose that thou hast learned overmuch of the wont of the Dusky Men,and hast seen their thralls?'She knitted her brows, and all the merriment went out of her face atthat word, and she answered:  'Yea, thou hast it; for I have bothseen their thralls and been in the Dale of thralldom; and how thencan I do less than I do?  But for thee, I perceive that thou hastbeen nigh unto our foes and hast fallen in with their thralls; andthat is well; for whatso tales we had told thee thereof it is likethou wouldst not have trowed in, as now thou must do, since thouthyself hast seen these poor folk.  But now I will tell thee, Gold-mane, that my soul is sick of these comings and goings for theslaughter of a few wretches; and I long for the Great Day of Battle,when it will be seen whether we shall live or die; and though I laughand jest, yet doth the wearing of the days wear me.'He looked kindly on her and said:  'I am War-leader of this Folk, andtrust me that the waiting-tide shall not be long; wherefore now,sister, be merry to-day, for that is but meet and right; and castaside thy care, for presently shalt thou behold many new friends.But now meseemeth overlong have ye been standing before our Gate, andit is time that ye should see the inside of our Burg and the insideof our House.'Indeed by this time so many men had come out of the street that theplace before the Gate was all thronged, and from where he stood Face-of-god could scarce see his father, or Folk-might and the Sun-beamand the chieftains.So he took Wood-father by the hand, and close behind him came Wood-wise and Bow-may, and he cried out for way that he might speak withthe Alderman, and men gave way to them, and he led those new-comersclose up to the gate-seats of the Elders, and as he clove the presssmiling and bright-eyed and happy, all gazed on him; but the Sun-beam, who was sitting between Iron-face and the Westland Chapman, andwho heretofore had been agaze with eyes beholding little, past whoseears the words went unheard, and whose mind wandered into thoughts ofthings unfashioned yet, when she beheld him close to her again, then,taken unawares, her eyes caressed him, and she turned as red as arose, as she felt all the sweetness of desire go forth from her tomeet him.  So that, he perceiving it, his voice was the clearer andsweeter for the inward joy he felt, as he said:'Alderman, meseemeth it is now time that we bring our Guests into theHouse of our Fathers; for since they are in warlike array, and we areno longer living in peace, and I am now War-leader of the Dale, Ideem it but meet that I should have the guesting of them.  Moreover,when we are come into our House, I will bid thee look into thytreasury, that thou may'st find therein somewhat which it maypleasure us to give to our Guests.'Said Iron-face:  'Thou sayest well, son, and since the day is nowworn past noon, and these folk are but just come from the Waste,therefore such as we have of meat and drink abideth them.  And surelythere is within our house a coffer which belongeth to thee and me;and forsooth I know not why we keep the treasures hoarded therein,save that it be for this cause:  that if we were to give to ourfriends that which we ourselves use and love, which would be of allthings pleasant to us, if we gave them such goods, they would be wornand worsened by our use of them.  For this reason, therefore, do wekeep fair things which we use not, so that we may give them to ourfriends.'Now, Guests, both of the Waste and the Westland, since here is noGate-thing or meeting of the Dale-wardens, and we sit here but forour pleasure, let us go take our pleasure within doors for a while,if it seem good to you.'Therewith he arose, and the folk made way for him and his Guests; andFolk-might went on the right hand of Iron-face, and beside him wentthe Chapman, who looked on him with a half-smile, as though he knewsomewhat of him.  But on the other side of Iron-face went the Sun-beam, whose hand he held, and after these came Face-of-god, leadingin the rest of the New-comers, who yet held the flowery branches intheir hands.Now so much had Face-of-god told the Dalesmen, that they deemed theyall knew these men for their battle-fellows of whom they had heardtell; and this the more as the men were so goodly and manly ofaspect, especially Folk-might, so that they seemed as if they werenigh akin to the Gods.  As for the Sun-beam, they knew not how topraise her beauty enough, but they said that they had never knownbefore how fair the Gods might be.  So they raised a great shout ofwelcome as the men came through the Gate into the Burg, and all menturned their backs on the booths, so eager were they to beholdclosely these new friends.But as the Guests went from the Gate to the House of the Face, goingvery slowly because of the press, there in the front of the throngstood the Bride with the women of the Runaways, whom she had causedto be clad very fairly; and she was fain to do them a pleasure bybringing them to sight of these new-comers, of whom she had not heardwho they were, though she had heard the cry that strangers were athand.  So there she stood smiling a little with the pleasure ofshowing a fair sight to the poor people, as folk do with children.But when she saw those twain going on each side of the Alderman sheknew them at once; and when the Sun-beam, who was on his left side,passed so close to her that she could see the very smoothness anddainty fashion of her skin, then was she astonied, and the worldseemed strange to her, and till they were gone by, and for a whileafterwards, she knew not where she was nor what she did, though itseemed to her as if she still saw the face of that fair woman as in apicture.But the Sun-beam had noted her at first, even amongst the fair womenof Burgstead, and she so steady and bright beside the wanderingtimorous eyes and lowering faces of the thralls.  But suddenly, aseye met eye, she saw her face change; she saw her cheek whiten, hereyes stare, and her lips quiver, and she knew at once who it was; forshe had not seen her before as Folk-might had.  Then the Sun-beamcast her eyes adown, lest her compassion might show in her face, andbe a fresh grief to her that had lost the wedding and the love; andso she passed on.As for Folk-might, he had seen her at once amongst all that folk ashe came into the street, and in sooth he was looking for her; andwhen he saw her face change, as the sight of the Sun-beam smote uponher heart, his own face burned with shame and anger, and he lookedback at her as he went toward the House.  But she saw him not, nornoted him; and none deemed it strange that he looked long on theBride, the treasure of Burgstead.  But for some while Folk-might wasfew-spoken and sharp-spoken amongst the chieftains; for he was slowto master his longing and his wrath.So when all the Guests had entered the door of the House of the Face,the Alderman turned back, and, standing on the threshold of hisHouse, spake unto the throng:'Men of the Dale, and ye Outlanders who may be here, know that thisis a happy day; for hither have come to us Guests, men of the kindredof the Gods, and they are even those of whom Face-of-god my son hathtold you.  And they are friends of our friends and foes of our foes.These men are now in my House, as is but right; but when they comeforth I look to you to cherish them in the best way ye know, and makemuch of them, as of those who may help us and who may by us beholpen.'Therewith he went in again and into the Hall, and bade show the New-comers to the dais; and wine of the best, and meat such as was tohand, was set before them.  He bade men also get ready high feast asgreat as might be against the evening; and they did his biddingstraightway.CHAPTER XXXIII.  THE ALDERMAN GIVES GIFTS TO THEM OF SHADOWY VALEIn the Hall of the Face Folk-might sat on the dais at the right handof the Alderman, and the Sun-beam on his left hand.  But Iron-facealso had beheld the Bride how her face changed, and he knew thecause, and was grieved and angry and ashamed thereof:  also hebethought him how this stranger was sitting in the very place wherethe Bride used to sit, and of all the love, as of a very daughter,that he had had for her; howbeit he constrained himself to talkcourteously and kindly both to Folk-might andthe Sun-beam, as behoved the Chief of the House and the Alderman ofthe Dale.  Moreover, he was not a little moved by the goodliness andwisdom of the Sun-beam and the manliness of Folk-might, who was themost chieftain-like of men.But while they sat there Face-of-god went from man to man of theGuests, and made much of each, but especially of Wood-father and hissons and Bow-may, and they loved him, and praised him, and deemed himthe best of hall-mates.  Nor might the Sun-beam altogether refrainher from looking lovingly on him, and it could be seen of her thatshe deemed he was doing well, and like a wise leader and chieftain.So wore away awhile, and men were fulfilled of meat and drink; sothen the Alderman arose and spake, and said:'Is it not so, Guests, that ye would now gladly behold our market,and the goodly wares which the chapmen have brought us from theCities?'Then most men cried out:  'Yea, yea!' and Iron-face said:'Then shall ye go, nor be holden by me from your pleasure.  And yekinsmen who are the most guest-fain and the wisest, go ye with ourfriends, and make all things easy and happy for them.  But first ofall, Guests, I were well pleased if ye would take some small mattersout of our abundance; for it were well that ye see them ere ye standbefore the chapmen's booths, lest ye chaffer with them for what yehave already.'They all praised his bounty and thanked him for his goodwill:  so hearose to go to his treasury, and bade certain of his folk go alongwith him to bear in the gifts.  But ere he had taken three steps downthe hall, Face-of-god prevented him and said:'Kinsman, if thou hast anywhere a hauberk somewhat better than folkare wont to bear, such as thine own hand fashioneth, and a sword ofthe like stuff, I would have thee give them, the sword to my brother-in-arms Wood-wise here, and the war-coat to my sister Bow-may, whoshooteth so well in the bow that none may shoot closer, and very fewas close; and her shaft it was that delivered me when my skull wasamongst the axes of the Dusky Men:  else had I not been here.'Thereat Bow-may reddened and looked down, like a scholar who hathbeen over-praised for his learning and diligence; but the Aldermansmiled on her and said:'I thank thee, son, that thou hast let me know what these our twofriends may be fain of:  and as for this damsel-at-arms, it is alittle thing that thou askest for her, and we might have found hersomething more worthy of her goodliness; yet forsooth, since we areall bound for the place where shafts and staves shall be good cheap,a greater treasure might be of less avail to her.'Thereat men laughed, and the Alderman went down the Hall with thosebearers of gifts, and was away for a space while they drank and mademerry:  but presently back they came from the treasury bearing loadsof goodly things which were laid on one of the endlong boards.  Thenbegan the gift-giving:  and first he gave unto Folk-might six goldencups marvellously fashioned, the work of four generations of wrightsin the Dale, and he himself had wrought the last two thereof.  ToSun-beam he gave a girdle of gold, fashioned with great mastery,whereon were images of the Gods and the Fathers, and warriors, andbeasts of the field and fowls of the air; and as he girt it about herloins, he said in a soft voice so that few heard:'Sun-beam, thou fair woman, time has been when thou wert to us as theedge of the poisonous sword or the midnight torch of the murderer;but now I know not how it will be, or if the grief which thou hastgiven me will ever wear out or not.  And now that I have beheld thee,I have little to do to blame my son; for indeed when I look on thee Icannot deem that there is any evil in thee.  Yea, however it may be,take thou this gift as the reward of thine exceeding beauty.'She looked on him with kind eyes, and said meekly:'Indeed, if I have hurt thee unwittingly, I grieve to have hurt sogood a man.  Hereafter belike we may talk more of this, but now Iwill but say, that whereas at first I needed but to win thy son'sgoodwill, so that our Folk might come to life and thriving again, nowit is come to this, that he holdeth my heart in his hand and may dowhat he will with it; therefore I pray thee withhold not thy loveeither from him or from me.'He looked on her wondering, and said:  'Thou art such an one as mightmake the old man young, and the boy grow into manhood suddenly; andthy voice is as sweet as the voice of the song-birds singing in thedawn of early summer soundeth to him who hath been sick unto death,but who hath escaped it and is mending.  And yet I fear thee.'Therewith he kissed her hand and turned unto the others, and he gaveunto Bow-may a hauberk of ring-mail of his own fashioning, a suredefence and a wonderful work, and the collar thereof was done withgold and gems.But he said to her:  'Fair damsel-at-arms, faithful is thy face, andthe fashion of thee is goodly:  now art thou become one of the bestof our friends, and this is little enough to give thee; yet would wefain ward thy body against the foeman; so grieve us not by gainsayingus.'And Bow-may was exceeding glad, and scarce knew how to cease handlingthat marvel of ring-mail.Then to Wood-wise Iron-face gave a most goodly sword, the blade allmarked with dark lines like the stream of an eddying river, the hiltsof steel and gold marvellously wrought; and all the work of a smithwho had dwelt in the house of his father's father, and was a greatwarrior.Unto Wood-father he gave a very goodly helm parcel-gilded; and to hissons and the other folk fair gifts of weapons and jewels and girdlesand cups and other good things; so that their hearts were full ofjoy, and they all praised his open hand.Then some of the best and merriest of the kinsmen of the Face, andFace-of-god with them, brought the Guests out into the street andamong the booths.  There Face-of-god beheld the Bride again; and shewas standing by the booth of a chapman and dealing with him for apiece of goodly silken cloth to be a gown for one of her guests, andshe was talking and smiling as she chaffered with him, as her wontwas; for she was ever very friendly of demeanour with all men.  Buthe noted that she was yet exceeding pale, and he was right sorrythereof, for he loved her friendly; yet now had he no shame for allthat had befallen, when he bethought him of the Sun-beam and the loveshe had for him.  And also he had a deeming that the Bride wouldbetter of her grief.CHAPTER XXXIV.  THE CHIEFTAINS TAKE COUNSEL IN THE HALL OF THE FACEThen turned Face-of-god back into the Hall, and saw where Iron-facesat at the dais, and with him Folk-might and Stone-face and the Elderof the Dale-wardens, and Sun-beam withal; so he went soberly up tothe board, and sat himself down thereat beside Stone-face, overagainst Folk-might and his father, beside whom sat the Sun-beam; andFolk-might looked on him gravely, as a man powerful and trustworthy,yet was his look somewhat sour.Then the Alderman said:  'My son, I said not to thee come backpresently, because I wotted that thou wouldst surely do so, knowingthat we have much to speak of.  For, whatever these thy friends mayhave done, or whatsoever thou hast done with them to grieve us, allthat must be set aside at this present time, since the matter in handis to save the Dale and its folk.  What sayest thou hereon?  Since,young as thou mayst be, thou art our War-leader, and doubtless shaltso be after the Folk-mote hath been holden.'Face-of-god answered not hastily:  indeed, as he sat thinking for aminute or two, the fair spring day seemed to darken about them or toglare into the light of flames amidst the night-tide; and the joyousclamour without doors seemed to grow hoarse and fearful as the soundof wailing and shrieking.  But he spake firmly and simply in a clearvoice, and said:'There can be no two words concerning what we have to aim at; theseDusky Men we must slay everyone, though we be fewer than they be.'Folk-might smiled and nodded his head; but the others sat staringdown the hall or into the hangings.Then spake Folk-might:  'Thou wert a boy methought when I cast myspear at thee last autumn, Face-of-god, but now hast thou grown intoa man.  Now tell me, what deemest thou we must do to slay them all?'Said Face-of-god:  'Once again it is clear that we must fall uponthem at home in Rose-dale and Silver-dale.'Again Folk-might nodded:  but Iron-face said:'Needeth this?  May we not ward the Dale and send many bands into thewood to fall upon them when we meet them?  Yea, and so doing theseour guests have already slain many, as this valiant man hath told mee'en now.  Will ye not slay so many at last, that they shall learn tofear us, and abide at home and leave us at peace?'But Face-of-god said:  'Meseemeth, father, that this is not thy rede,and that thou sayest this but to try me:  and perchance ye have beentalking about me when I was without in the street e'en now.  Even ifit might be that we should thus cow these felons into abiding at homeand tormenting their own thralls at their ease, yet how then are ourfriends of the Wolf holpen to their own again?  And I shall tell theethat I have promised to this man and this woman that I will give themno less than a man's help in this matter.  Moreover, I have spoken inevery house of the Dale, and to the Shepherds and the Woodlanders,and there is no man amongst them but will follow me in the quarrel.Furthermore, they have heard of the thralldom that is done on men nogreat way from their own houses; yea, they have seen it; and theyremember the old saw, "Grief in thy neighbour's hall is grief in thygarth," and sure it is, father, that whether thou or I gainsay them,go they will to deliver the thralls of the Dusky Men, and will leaveus alone in the Dale.''This is no less than sooth,' said the Dale-warden, 'never have mengone forth more joyously to a merry-making than all men of us shallwend to this war.''But,' said Face-of-god, 'of one thing ye may be sure, that these menwill not abide our pleasure till we cut them all off in scatteredbands, nor will they sit deedless at home.  Nor indeed may they; forwe have heard from their thralls that they look to have fresh tribesof them come to hand to eat their meat and waste their servants, andthese and they must find new abodes and new thralls; and they are nowwarned by the overthrows and slayings that they have had at our handsthat we are astir, and they will not delay long, but will fall uponus with all their host; it might even be to-day or to-morrow.'Said Folk-might:  'In all this thou sayest sooth, brother of theDale; and to cut this matter short, I will tell you all, thatyesterday we had with us a runaway from Silver-dale (it is overlongto tell how we fell in with her; for it was a woman).  But she toldus that this very moon is a new tribe come into the Dale, six longhundreds in number, and twice as many more are looked for in twoeights of days, and that ere this moon hath waned, that is, intwenty-four days, they will wend their ways straight for Burgdale,for they know the ways thereto.  So I say that Face-of-god is rightin all wise.  But tell me, brother, hast thou thought of how we shallcome upon these men?''How many men wilt thou lead into battle?' said Face-of-god.Folk-might reddened, and said:  'A few, a few; maybe two-hundreds alltold.''Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'but some special gain wilt thou be to us.''So I deem at least,' said Folk-might.Said Face-of-god:  'Good is that.  Now have we held our Weapon-showin the Dale, and we find that we together with you be sixteen longhundreds of men; and the tale of the foemen that be now in Silver-dale, new-comers and all, shall be three thousands or thereabout, andin Rose-dale hard on a thousand.''Scarce so many,' said Folk-might; 'some of the felons have died; wetold over our silver arm-rings yesterday, and the tale was threehundred and eighty and six.  Besides, they were never so many as thoudeemest.''Well,' said Face-of-god, 'yet at least they shall outnumber ussorely.  We may scarce leave the Dale unguarded when our host isgone; therefore I deem that we shall have but one thousand of men forour onslaught on Silver-dale.''How come ye to that?' said Stone-face.Said Face-of-god:  'Abide a while, fosterer!  Though the odds betweenus be great, it is not to be hidden that I wot how ye of the Wolfknow of privy passes into Silver-dale; yea, into the heart thereof;and this is the special gain ye have to give us.  Therefore we, thethousand men, falling on the foe unawares, shall make a greatslaughter of them; and if the murder be but grim enough, thosethralls of theirs shall fear us and not them, as already they hatethem and not us, so that we may look to them for rooting out thesesorry weeds after the overthrow.  And what with one thing, what withanother, we may cherish a good hope of clearing Silver-dale at onestroke with the said thousand men.'There remaineth Rose-dale, which will be easier to deal with,because the Dusky Men therein are fewer and the thralls as many:that also would I fall on at the same time as we fall on Silver-dalewith the men that are left over from the Silver-dale onslaught.Wherefore my rede is, that we gather all those unmeet for battle inthe field into this Burg, with ten tens of men to strengthen them;which shall be enough for them, along with the old men, and lads, andsturdy women, to defend themselves till help comes, if aught of evilbefall, or to flee into the mountains, or at the worst to dievaliantly.  Then let the other five hundreds fare up to Rose-dale,and fall on the Dusky Men therein about the same time, but not beforeour onslaught on Silver-dale:  thus shall hand help foot, so thatstumbling be not falling; and we may well hope that our rede shallthrive.'Then was he silent, and the Sun-beam looked upon him with gleamingeyes and parted lips, waiting eagerly to hear what Folk-might wouldsay.  He held his peace a while, drumming on the board with hisfingers, and none else spake a word.  At last he said:'War-leader of Burgdale, all that thou hast spoken likes me well, andeven so must it be done, saving that parting of our host and sendingone part to fall upon Rose-dale.  I say, nay; let us put all ourmight into that one stroke on Silver-dale, and then we are undoneindeed if we fail; but so shall we be if we fail anywise; but if wewin Silver-dale, then shall Rose-dale lie open before us.''My brother,' said Face-of-god, 'thou art a tried warrior, and I buta lad:  but dost thou not see this, that whatever we do, we shall notat one onslaught slay all the Dusky Men of Silver-dale, and thosethat flee before us shall betake them to Rose-dale, and tell all thetale, and what shall hinder them then from falling on Burgdale (sincethey are no great way from it) after they have murdered what theywill of the unhappy people under their hands?'Said Folk-might:  'I say not but that there is a risk thereof, but inwar we must needs run such risks, and all should be risked ratherthan that our blow on Silver-dale be light.  For we be the fewer; andif the foemen have time to call that to mind, then are we all lost.'Said Stone-face:  'Meseemeth, War-leader, that there is nought muchto dread in leaving Rose-dale to itself for a while; for not only maywe follow hard on the fleers if they flee to Rose-dale, and be thereno long time after them, before they have time to stir their host butalso after the overthrow we shall be free to send men back toBurgdale by way of Shadowy Vale.  I deem that herein Folk-might haththe right of it.''Even so say I,' said the Alderman; 'besides, we might theft leavemore folk behind us for the warding of the Dale.  So, son, the riskwhereof thou speakest groweth the lesser the longer it is looked on.'Then spake the Dale-warden:  'Yet saving your wisdom, Alderman, therisk is there yet.  For if these felons come into the Dale at all,even if the folk left behind hold the Burg and keep themselvesunmurdered, yet may they not hinder the foe from spoiling ourhomesteads; so that our folk coming back in triumph shall find ruinat home, and spend weary days in hunting their foemen, who shall,many of them, escape into the Wild-wood.''Yea,' said the Sun-beam, 'sooth is that; and Face-of-god is wise tothink of it and of other matters.  Yet one thing we must bear inmind, that all may not go smoothly in our day's work in Silver-dale;so we must have force there to fall back on, in case we miss ourstroke at first.  Therefore, I say, send we no man to Rose-dale, andleave we no able man-at-arms behind in the Burg, so that we have withus every blade that may be gathered.'Iron-face smiled and said:  'Thou art wise, damsel; and I marvel thatso fair-fashioned a thing as thou can think so hardly of the meetingof the fallow blades.  But hearken! will not the Dusky Men hear thatwe have stripped the Dale of fighting-men, and may they not then giveour host the go-by and send folk to ruin us?'There was silence while Face-of-god looked down on the board; butpresently he lifted up his face and said:'Folk-might was right when he said that all must be risked.  Let usleave Rose-dale till we have overcome them of Silver-dale.  Moreover,my father, thou must not deem of these felons as if they were of likewits to us, to forecast the deeds to come, and weigh the chancesnicely, and unravel tangled clews.  Rather they move like to thestares in autumn, or the winter wild-geese, and will all be thrustforward by some sting that entereth into their imaginations.Therefore, if they have appointed one moon to wear before they fallupon us, they will not stir till then, and we have time enough to dowhat must be done.  Wherefore am I now of one mind with the rest ofyou.  Now meseemeth it were well that these things which we havespoken here, and shall speak, should not be noised abroad openly;nay, at the Folk-mote it would be well that nought be said about theday or the way of our onslaught on Silver-dale, lest the foe takewarning and be on their guard.  Though, sooth to say, did I deem thatif they had word of our intent they of Rose-dale would jointhemselves to them of Silver-dale, and that we should thus have allour foes in one net, then were I fain if the word would reach them.For my soul loathes the hunting that shall befall up and down thewood for the slaying of a man here, and two or three there, and thewearing of the days in wandering up and down with weapons in thehand, and the spinning out of hatred and delaying of peace.'Then Iron-face reached his hand across the board and took his son'shand, and said:'Hail to thee, son, for thy word!  Herein thou speakest as if from myvery soul, and fain am I of such a War-leader.'And desire drew the eyes of the Sun-beam to Face-of-god, and shebeheld him proudly.  But he said:'All hath been spoken that the others of us may speak; and now itfalleth to the part of Folk-might to order our goings for the trystfor the onslaught, and the trysting-place shall be in Shadowy Vale.How sayest thou, Chief of the Wolf?'Said Folk-might:  'I have little to say; and it is for the War-leaderto see to this closely and piecemeal.  I deem, as we all deem, thatthere should be no delay; yet were it best to wend not all togetherto Shadowy Vale, but in divers bands, as soon as ye may after theFolk-mote, by the sure and nigh ways that we shall show you.  Andwhen we are gathered there, short is the rede, for all is ready thereto wend by the passes which we know throughly, and whereby it is buttwo days' journey to the head of Silver-dale, nigh to the caves ofthe silver, where the felons dwell the thickest.'He set his teeth, and his colour came and went:  for as constantly asthe onslaught had been in his mind, yet whenever he spake of thegreat day of battle, hope and joy and anger wrought a tumult in hissoul; and now that it was so nigh withal, he could not refrain hisjoy.But he spake again:  'Now therefore, War-leader, it is for thee toorder the goings of thy folk.  But I will tell thee that they shallnot need to take aught with them save their weapons and victual forthe way, that is, for thirty hours; because all is ready for them inShadowy Vale, though it be but a poor place as to victual.  Canstthou tell us, therefore, what thou wilt do?'Face-of-god had knit his brows and become gloomy of countenance; butnow his face cleared, and he set his hand to his pouch, and drewforth a written parchment, and said:'This is the order whereof I have bethought me.  Before the Folk-moteI and the Wardens shall speak to the leaders of hundreds, who bemostly here at the Fair, and give them the day and the hour whereonthey shall, each hundred, take their weapons and wend to ShadowyVale, and also the place where they shall meet the men of yours whoshall lead them across the Waste.  These hundred-leaders shall thengo straightway and give the word to the captains of scores, and thecaptains of scores to the captains of tens; and if, as is scarcedoubtful, the Folk-mote yea-says the onslaught and the fellowshipwith you of the Wolf, then shall those leaders of tens bring theirmen to the trysting-place, and so go their ways to Shadowy Vale.  Nowhere I have the roll of our Weapon-show, and I will look to it thatnone shall be passed over; and if ye ask me in what order they hadbest get on the way, my rede is that a two hundred should depart onthe very evening of the day of the Folk-mote, and these to be of ourfolk of the Upper Dale; and on the morning of the morrow of the Folk-mote another two hundreds from the Dale; and in the evening of thesame day the folk of the Shepherds, three hundreds or more, and thatwill be easy to them; again on the next day two more bands of theLower Dale, one in the morning, one in the evening.  Lastly, in theearliest dawn of the third day from the Folk-mote shall theWoodlanders wend their ways.  But one hundred of men let us leavebehind for the warding of the Burg, even as we agreed before.  As forthe place of tryst for the faring over the Waste, let it be the endof the knolls just by the jaws of the pass yonder, where theWeltering Water comes into the Dale from the East.  How say ye?'They all said, and Folk-might especially, that it was right welldevised, and that thus it should be done.Then turned Face-of-god to the Dale-warden, and said:'It were good, brother, that we saw the other wardens as soon as maybe, to do them to wit of this order, and what they have to do.'Therewith he arose and took the Elder of the Dale-wardens away withhim, and the twain set about their business straight-way.  Neitherdid the others abide long in the Hall, but went out into the Burg tosee the chapmen and their wares.  There the Alderman bought what heneeded of iron and steel and other matters; and Folk-might cheapenedhim a dagger curiously wrought, and a web of gold and silk for theSun-beam, for which wares he paid in silver arm-rings, new-wroughtand of strange fashion.But amidst of the chaffer was now a great ring of men; and in themidst of the ring stood Redesman, fiddle and bow in hand, and withhim were four damsels wondrously arrayed; for the first was clad in asmock so craftily wrought with threads of green and many colours,that it seemed like a piece of the green field beset with primrosesand cowslips and harebells and windflowers, rather than a garmentwoven and sewn; and in her hand she bore a naked sword, with goldenhilts and gleaming blade.  But the second bore on her roses done inlike manner, both blossoms and green leaves, wherewith her body wascovered decently, which else had been naked.  The third was clad asthough she were wading the wheat-field to the waist, and above waswrapped in the leaves and bunches of the wine-tree.  And the fourthwas clad in a scarlet gown flecked with white wool to set forth thewinter's snow, and broidered over with the burning brands of the HolyHearth; and she bore on her head a garland of mistletoe.  And thesefour damsels were clearly seen to image the four seasons of the year--Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.  But amidst them stood afountain or conduit of gilded work cunningly wrought, and full of thebest wine of the Dale, and gilded cups and beakers hung about it.So now Redesman fell to caressing his fiddle with the bow till itbegan to make sweet music, and therewith the hearts of all dancedwith it; and presently words come into his mouth, and he fell tosinging; and the damsels answered him:Earth-wielders, that fashion the Dale-dwellers' treasure,   Soft are ye by seeming, yet hardy of heart!No warrior amongst us withstandeth your pleasure;   No man from his meadow may thrust you apart.Fresh and fair are your bodies, but far beyond telling   Are the years of your lives, and the craft ye have stored.Come give us a word, then, concerning our dwelling,   And the days to befall us, the fruit of the sword.Winter saith:When last in the feast-hall the Yule-fire flickered,   The foot of no foeman fared over the snow,And nought but the wind with the ash-branches bickered:   Next Yule ye may deem it a long time ago.Autumn saith:Loud laughed ye last year in the wheat-field a-smiting;   And ye laughed as your backs drave the beam of the press.When the edge of the war-sword the acres are lighting   Look up to the Banner and laugh ye no less.Summer saith:Ye called and I came, and how good was the greeting,   When ye wrapped me in roses both bosom and side!Here yet shall I long, and be fain of our meeting,   As hidden from battle your coming I bide.Spring saith:I am here for your comfort, and lo! what I carry;   The blade with the bright edges bared to the sun.To the field, to the work then, that e'en I may tarry   For the end of the tale in my first days begun!Therewith the throng opened, and a young man stepped lightly into thering, clad in very fair armour, with a gilded helm on his head; andhe took the sword from the hand of the Maiden of Spring, and waved itin the air till the westering sun flashed back from it.  Then each ofthe four damsels went up to the swain and kissed his mouth; andRedesman drew the bow across the strings, and the four damsels sangtogether, standing round about the young warrior:It was but a while since for earth's sake we trembled,   Lest the increase our life-days had won for the Dale,All the wealth that the moons and the years had assembled,   Should be but a mock for the days of your bale.But now we behold the sun smite on the token   In the hand of the Champion, the heart of a man;We look down the long years and see them unbroken;   Forth fareth the Folk by the ways it began.So bid ye these chapmen in autumn returning,   To bring iron for ploughshares and steel for the scythe,And the over-sea oil that hath felt the sun's burning,   And fair webs for your women soft-spoken and blithe;And pledge ye your word in the market to meet them,   As many a man and as many a maid,As eager as ever, as guest-fain to greet them,   And bide till the booth from the waggon is made.Come, guests of our lovers! for we, the year-wielders,   Bid each man and all to come hither and takeA cup from our hands midst the peace of our shielders,   And drink to the days of the Dale that we make.Then went the damsels to that wine-fountain, and drew thence cups ofthe best and brightest wine of the Dale, and went round about thering, and gave drink to whomsoever would, both of the chapmen and theothers; while the weaponed youth stood in the midst bearing aloft hissword and shield like an image in a holy place, and Redesman's bowstill went up and down the strings, and drew forth a sweet and merrytune.Great game it was now to see the stark Burgdale carles dragging theMen of the Plain, little loth, up to the front of the ring, that theymight stretch out their hands for a cup, and how many a one, as hetook it, took as much as he might of the damsel's hand withal.  Asfor the damsels, they played the Holy Play very daintily, neitherreddening nor laughing, but faring so solemnly, and withal so sweetlyand bright-faced, that it might well have been deemed that they werein very sooth Maidens of the God of Earth sent from the ever-enduringHall to cheer the hearts of men.So simply and blithely did the Men of Burgdale disport them after themanner of their fathers, trusting in their valour and beholding thegood days to be.So wore the evening, and when night was come, men feasted throughoutthe Burg from house to house, and every hall was full.  But theGuests from Shadowy Vale feasted in the Hall of the Face in all gleeand goodwill; and with them were the chief of the chapmen and twoothers; but the rest of them had been laid hold of by goodmen of theBurg, and dragged into their feast-halls, for they were fain of thoseguests and their tales.  One of the chapmen in the House of the Faceknew Folk-might, and hailed him by the name he had borne in theCities, Regulus to wit; indeed, the chief chapman knew him, and evensomewhat over-well, for he had been held to ransom by Folk-might inthose past days, and even yet feared him, because he, the chapman,had played somewhat of a dastard's part to him.  But the other was anopen-hearted and merry fellow, and no weakling; and Folk-might wasfain of his talk concerning times bygone, and the fields they hadfoughten in, and other adventures that had befallen them, both goodand evil.As for Face-of-god, he went about the Hall soberly, and spake no morethan behoved him, so as not to seem a mar-feast; for the image of theslaughter to be yet abode with him, and his heart foreboded theafter-grief of the battle.  He had no speech with the Sun-beam tillmen were sundering after the feast, and then he came close to heramidst of the turmoil, and said:'Time presses on me these days; but if thou wouldest speak with meto-morrow as I would with thee, then mightest thou go on the Bridgeof the Burg about sunrise, and I will be there, and we two only.'Her face, which had been somewhat sad that evening (for she had beenwatching his), brightened at that word, and she took his hand as folkcame thronging round about them, and said:'Yea, friend, I shall be there, and fain of thee.'  And therewithalthey sundered for that night.And all men went to sleep throughout the Burg:  howbeit they set awatch at the Burg-Gate; and Hall-face, when he was coming back fromthe woodland ward about sunset, fell in with Redcoat of Waterless andfour score men on the Portway coming to meet him and take his place.All which was clean contrary to the wont of the Burgdalers, who atmost whiles held no watch and ward, not even in Fair-time.CHAPTER XXXV.  FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE SUN-BEAMFace-of-God was at the Bridge on the morrow before sun-rising, and ashe turned about at the Bridge-foot he saw the Sun-beam coming downthe street; and his heart rose to his mouth at the sight of her, andhe went to meet her and took her by the hand; and there were no wordsbetween them till they had kissed and caressed each other, for therewas no one stirring about them.  So they went over the Bridge intothe meadows, and eastward of the beaten path thereover.The grass was growing thick and strong, and it was full of flowers,as the cowslip and the oxlip, and the chequered daffodil, and thewild tulip:  the black-thorn was well-nigh done blooming, but thehawthorn was in bud, and in some places growing white.  It was a fairmorning, warm and cloudless, but the night had been misty, and thehaze still hung about the meadows of the Dale where they werewettest, and the grass and its flowers were heavy with dew, so thatthe Sun-beam went barefoot in the meadow.  She had a dark cloak castover her kirtle, and had left her glittering gown behind her in theHouse.They went along hand in hand exceeding fain of each other, and thesun rose as they went, and the long beams of gold shone through thetops of the tall trees across the grass they trod, and a light windrose up in the north, as Face-of-god stayed a moment and turnedtoward the Face of the Sun and prayed to Him, while the Sun-beam'shand left the War-leader's hand and stole up to his golden locks andlay amongst them.Presently they went on, and the feet of Face-of-god led him unwittingtoward the chestnut grove by the old dyke where he had met the Bridesuch a little while ago, till he bethought whither he was going andstopped short and reddened; and the Sun-beam noted it, but spake not;but he said:  'Hereby is a fair place for us to sit and talk till theday's work beginneth.'So then he turned aside, and soon they came to a hawthorn brake outof which arose a great tall-stemmed oak, showing no green as yet savea little on its lower twigs; and anigh it, yet with room for itsboughs to grow freely, was a great bird-cherry tree, all covered nowwith sweet-smelling white blossoms.  There they sat down on the trunkof a tree felled last year, and she cast off her cloak, and took hisface between her two hands and kissed him long and fondly, and for awhile their joy had no word.  But when speech came to them, it wasshe that spake first and said:'Gold-mane, my dear, sorely I wonder at thee and at me, how we arechanged since that day last autumn when I first saw thee.  Whiles Ithink, didst thou not laugh when thou wert by thyself that day, andmock at me privily, that I must needs take such wisdom on myself, andlesson thee standing like a stripling before me.  Dost thou not callit all to mind and make merry over it, now that thou art become agreat chieftain and a wise warrior, and I am yet what I always was, ayoung maiden of the kindred; save that now I abide no longer for mylove?'Her face was exceeding bright and rippled with joyous smiles, and helooked at her and deemed that her heart was overflowing withhappiness, and he wondered at her indeed that she was so glad of him,and he said:'Yea, indeed, oft do I see that morning in the woodland hall and theeand me therein, as one looketh on a picture; yea verily, and I laugh,yet is it for very bliss; neither do I mock at all.  Did I not deemthee a God then? and am I not most happy now when I can call it thusto mind?  And as to thee, thou wert wise then, and yet art thou wisenow.  Yea, I thought thee a God; and if we are changed, is it notrather that thou hast lifted me up to thee, and not come down to me?'Yet therewithal he knit his brows somewhat and said:'Yet thou hast not to tell me that all thy love for thy Folk, and thyyearning hope for its recoverance, was but a painted show.  Else whyshouldst thou love me the better now that I am become a chieftain,and therefore am more meet to understand thy hope and thy sorrow?Did I not behold thee as we stood before the Wolf of the Hall ofShadowy Vale, how the tears stood in thine eyes as thou beheldesthim, and thine hand in mine quivered and clung to me, and thou wertall changed in a moment of time?  Was all this then but a seeming anda beguilement?''O young man,' she said, 'hast thou not said it, that we stood thereclose together, and my hand in thine and desire growing up in me?Dost thou not know how this also quickeneth the story of our Folk,and our goodwill towards the living, and remembrance of the dead?Shall they have lived and desired, and we deny desire and life?  Ortell me:  what was it made thee so chieftain-like in the Hallyesterday, so that thou wert the master of all our wills, for asself-willed as some of us were?  Was it not that I, whom thou deemestlovely, was thereby watching thee and rejoicing in thee?  Did not thesweetness of thy love quicken thee?  Yet because of that was thywarrior's wisdom and thy foresight an empty show?  Heedest thounought the Folk of the Dale?  Wouldest thou sunder from the childrenof the Fathers, and dwell amongst strangers?'He kissed her and smiled on her and said:  'Did I not say of theethat thou wert wiser than the daughters of men?  See how wise thouhast made me!'She spake again:  'Nay, nay, there was no feigning in my love for mypeople.  How couldest thou think it, when the Fathers and the kindredhave made this body that thou lovest, and the voice of their songs isin the speech thou deemest sweet?'He said:  'Sweet friend, I deemed not that there was feigning inthee:  I was but wondering what I am and how I was fashioned, that Ishould make thee so glad that thou couldst for a while forget thyhope of the days before we met.'She said:  'O how glad, how glad!  Yet was I nought hapless.  Indespite of all trouble I had no down-weighing grief, and I had thehope of my people before me.  Good were my days; but I knew not tillnow how glad a child of man may be.'Their words were hushed for a while amidst their caresses.  Then shesaid:'Gold-mane, my friend, I mocked not my past self because I deem thatI was a fool then, but because I see now that all that my wisdomcould do, would have come about without my wisdom; and that thou,deeming thyself something less than wise, didst accomplish the thingI craved, and that which thou didst crave also; and withal wisdomembraced thee, along with love.'Therewith she cast her arms about him and said:'O friend, I mock myself of this:  that erst thou deemedst me a Godand fearedst me, but now thou seemest to me to be a God, and I fearthee.  Yea, though I have longed so sore to be with thee since theday of Shadowy Vale, and though I have wearied of the slow wearing ofthe days, and it hath tormented me; yet now that I am with thee, Ibless the torment of my longing; for it is but my longing thatcompelleth me to cast away my fear of thee and caress thee, because Ihave learned how sweet it is to love thee thus.'He wound his arms about her, and sweeter was their longing than merejoy; and though their love was beyond measure, yet was therein noshame to aught, not even to the lovely Dale and that fair season ofspring, so goodly they were among the children of men.In a while they arose and turned homeward, and went over the openmeadow, and it was yet early, and the dew was as heavy on the grassas before, though the wide sunlight was now upon it, glittering onthe wet blades, and shining through the bells of the chequereddaffodils till they looked like gouts of blood.'Look,' said Sun-beam, as they went along by the same way whereasthey came, 'deemest thou not that other speech-friends besides ushave been abroad to talk together apart on this morning of the eve ofbattle.  It is nought unwonted, that we do, even though we forget thetrouble of the people to think of our own joy for a while.'The smile died out of her face as she spoke, and she said:'O friend, this much may I say for myself in all sooth, that indeed Iwould die for the kindred and its good days, nor falter therein; butif I am to die, might I but die in thine arms!'He looked very lovingly on her, and put his arm about her and kissedher and said:  'What ails us to stand in the doom-ring and bearwitness against ourselves before the kindred?  Now I will say, thatwhatsoever the kindred may or can call upon me to do, that will I do,nor grudge the deed:  I am sackless before them.  But that is truewhich I spake to thee when we came together up out of Shadowy Vale,to wit, that I am no strifeful man, but a peaceful; and I look to itto win through this war, and find on the other side either death, orlife amongst a happy folk; and I deem that this is mostly the mind ofour people.'She said:  'Thou shalt not die, thou shalt not die!''Mayhappen not,' he said; 'yet yesterday I could not but look intothe slaughter to come, and it seemed to me a grim thing, and darkenedthe day for me; and I grew acold as a man walking with the dead.  Buttell me:  thou sayest I shall not die; dost thou say this onlybecause I am become dear to thee, or dost thou speak it out of thyforesight of things to come?'She stopped and looked silently a while over the meadows towards thehouses of the Thorp:  they were standing now on the border of ashallow brook that ran down toward the Weltering Water; it had alittle strand of fine sand like the sea-shore, driven close together,and all moist, because that brook was used to flood the meadow forthe feeding of the grass; and the last evening the hatches which heldup the water had been drawn, so that much had ebbed away and left thestrand aforesaid.After a while the Sun-beam turned to Face-of-god, and she was becomesomewhat pale; she said:'Nay, I have striven to see, and can see nought save the picture ofhope and fear that I make for myself.  So it oft befalleth foreseeingwomen, that the love of a man cloudeth their vision.  Be content,dear friend; it is for life or death; but whichso it be, the same forme and thee together?''Yea,' he said, 'and well content I am; so now let each of us trustin the other to be both good and dear, even as I trusted in thee thefirst hour that I looked on thee.''It is well,' she said; 'it is well.  How fair thou art; and how fairis the morn, and this our Dale in the goodly season; and all thisabideth us when the battle is over.'Once more her voice became sweet and wheedling, and the smile lit upher face again, and she pointed down to the sand with her finger, andsaid:'See thou!  Here indeed have other lovers passed by across the brook.Shall we wish them good luck?'He laughed and looked down on the sand, and said:'Thou art in haste to make a story up.  Indeed I see that these firstfootprints are of a woman, for no carle of the Dale has a foot assmall; for we be tall fellows; and these others withal are a man'sfootprints; and if they showed that they had been walking side byside, simple had been thy tale; but so it is not.  I cannot say thatthese two pairs of feet went over the brook within five minutes ofeach other; but sure it is that they could not have been faring sideby side.  Well, belike they were lovers bickering, and we may wishthem luck out of that.  Truly it is well seen that Bow-may hath donethine hunting for thee, dear friend; or else wouldest thou havelacked venison; for thou hast no hunter's eye.''Well,' she said, 'but wish them luck, and give me thine hand uponit.'He took her hand, and fondled it, and said:  'By this hand of myspeech-friend, I wish these twain all luck, in love and in leisure,in faring and fighting, in sowing and samming, in getting and giving.Is it well enough wished?  If so it be, then come thy ways, dearfriend; for the day's work is at hand.''It is well wished,' she said.  'Now hearken:  by the valiant hand ofthe War-leader, by the hand that shall unloose my girdle, I wishthese twain to be as happy as we be.'He made as if to draw her away, but she hung aback to set the printof her foot beside the woman's foot, and then they went on together,and soon crossed the Bridge, and came home to the House of the Face.When they had broken their fast, Face-of-god would straight get tohis business of ordering matters for the warfare, and was wishful tospeak with Folk-might; but found him not, either in the House or thestreet.  But a man said:'I saw the tall Guest come abroad from the House and go toward theBridge very early in the morning.'The Sun-beam, who was anigh when that was spoken, heard it andsmiled, and said:  'Gold-mane, deemest thou that it was my brotherwhom we blessed?''I wot not,' he said; 'but I would he were here, for this gear mustspeedily be looked to.'Nevertheless it was nigh an hour before Folk-might came home to theHouse.  He strode in lightly and gaily, and shaking the crest of hiswar-helm as he went.  He looked friendly on Face-of-god, and said tohim:'Thou hast been seeking me, War-leader; but grudge it not that I havecaused thee to tarry.  For as things have gone, I am twice the manfor thine helping that I was yester-eve; and thou art so ready anddeft, that all will be done in due time.'He looked as if he would have had Face-of-god ask of him what madehim so fain, but Face-of-god said only:'I am glad of thy gladness; but now let us dally no longer, for Ihave many folk to see to-day and much to set a-going.'So therewith they spake together a while, and then went their waystogether toward Carlstead and the Woodlanders.CHAPTER XXXVI.  FOLK-MIGHT SPEAKETH WITH THE BRIDEIt must be told that those footprints which Face-of-god and the Sun-beam had blessed betwixt jest and earnest had more to do with themthan they wotted of.  For Folk-might, who had had many thoughts andlongings since he had seen the Bride again, rose up early aboutsunrise, and went out-a-doors, and wandered about the Burg, lettinghis eyes stray over the goodly stone houses and their trim gardens,yet noting them little, since the Bride was not there.At last he came to where there was an open place, straight-sided,longer than it was wide, with a wall on each side of it, over whichshowed the blossomed boughs of pear and cherry and plum-trees:  oneither hand before the wall was a row of great lindens, now showingtheir first tender green, especially on their lower twigs, where theywere sheltered by the wall.  At the nether end of this place Folk-might saw a grey stone house, and he went towards it betwixt thelindens, for it seemed right great, and presently was but a score ofpaces from its door, and as yet there was no man, carle or queen,stirring about it.It was a long low house with a very steep roof; but belike the hallwas built over some undercroft, for many steps went up to the door oneither hand; and the doorway was low, with a straight lintel underits arch.  This house, like the House of the Face, seemed ancient andsomewhat strange, and Folk-might could not choose but take note ofit.  The front was all of good ashlar work, but it was carven allover, without heed being paid to the joints of the stones, into onepicture of a flowery meadow, with tall trees and bushes in it, andfowl perched in the trees and running through the grass, and sheepand kine and oxen and horses feeding down the meadow; and over thedoor at the top of the stair was wrought a great steer bigger thanall the other neat, whose head was turned toward the sun-rising anduplifted with open mouth, as though he were lowing aloud.  Exceedingfair seemed that house to Folk-might, and as though it were thedwelling of some great kindred.But he had scarce gone over it with his eyes, and was just about todraw nigher yet to it, when the door at the top of those stepsopened, and a woman came out of the house clad in a green kirtle anda gown of brazil, with a golden-hilted sword girt to her side.  Folk-might saw at once that it was the Bride, and drew aback behind one ofthe trees so that she might not see him, if she had not already seenhim, as it seemed not that she had, for she stayed but for a momenton the top of the stair, looking out down the tree-rows, and thencame down the stair and went soberly along the road, passing so closeto Folk-might that he could see the fashion of her beauty closely, asone looks into the work of some deftest artificer.  Then it camesuddenly into his head that he would follow her and see whither shewas wending.  'At least,' said he to himself, 'if I come not tospeech with her, I shall be nigh unto her, and shall see somewhat ofher beauty.'So he came out quietly from behind the tree, and followed her softly;and he was clad in no garment save his kirtle, and bare no weapons toclash and jingle, though he had his helm on his head for lack of asofter hat.  He kept her well in sight, and she went straight onwardand looked not back.  She went by the way whereas he had come, tillthey were in the main street, wherein as yet was no one afoot; shemade her way to the Bridge, and passed over it into the meadows; butwhen she had gone but a few steps, she stayed a little and looked onthe ground, and as she did so turned a little toward Folk-might, whohad drawn back into the last of the refuges over the up-streambuttresses.  He saw that there was a half-smile on her face, but hecould not tell whether she were glad or sorry.  A light wind wasbeginning to blow, that stirred her raiment and raised a lock of hairthat had strayed from the golden fillet round about her head, and shelooked most marvellous fair.Now she looked along the grass that glittered under the beams of thenewly-risen sun, and noted belike how heavy the dew lay on it; andthe grass was high already, for the spring had been hot, and hayselwould be early in the Dale.  So she put off her shoes, that were ofdeerskin and broidered with golden threads, and turned somewhat fromthe way, and hung them up amidst the new green leaves of a hawthornbush that stood nearby, and so went thwart the meadow somewhateastward straight from that bush, and her feet shone out like pearlsamidst the deep green grass.Folk-might followed presently, and she stayed not again, nor turned,nor beheld him; he recked not if she had, for then would he have comeup with her and hailed her, and he knew that she was no foolishmaiden to start at the sight of a man who was the friend of her Folk.So they went their ways till she came to the strand of the water-meadow brook aforesaid, and she went through the little ripples ofthe shallow without staying, and on through the tall deep grass ofthe meadow beyond, to where they met the brook again; for it sweptround the meadow in a wide curve, and turned back toward itself; soit was some half furlong over from water to water.She stood a while on the brink of the brook here, which was brim-fulland nigh running into the grass, because there was a dam just belowthe place; and Folk-might drew nigher to her under cover of thethorn-bushes, and looked at the place about her and beyond her.  Themeadow beyond stream was very fair and flowery, but not right great;for it was bounded by a grove of ancient chestnut trees, that went onand on toward the southern cliffs of the Dale:  in front of thechestnut wood stood a broken row of black-thorn bushes, now growinggreen and losing their blossom, and he could see betwixt them thatthere was a grassy bank running along, as if there had once been aturf-wall and ditch round about the chestnut trees.  For indeed thiswas the old place of tryst between Gold-mane and the Bride, whereofthe tale hath told before.The Bride stayed scarce longer than gave him time to note all this;but he deemed that she was weeping, though he could not rightly seeher face; for her shoulders heaved, and she hung her face adown andput up her hands to it.  But now she went a little higher up thestream, where the water was shallower, and waded the stream and wentup over the meadow, still weeping, as he deemed, and went between theblack-thorn bushes, and sat her down on the grassy bank with her backto the chestnut trees.Folk-might was ashamed to have seen her weeping, and was half-mindedto turn him back again at once; but love constrained him, and he saidto himself, 'Where shall I see her again privily if I pass by thistime and place?'  So he waited a little till he deemed she might havemastered the passion of tears, and then came forth from his bush, andwent down to the water and crossed it, and went quietly over themeadow straight towards her.  But he was not half-way across, whenshe lifted up her face from between her hands and beheld the mancoming.  She neither started nor rose up; but straightened herself asshe sat, and looked right into Folk-might's eyes as he drew near,though the tears were not dry on her cheeks.Now he stood before her, and said:  'Hail to the Daughter of a mightyHouse!  Mayst thou live happy!'She answered:  'Hail to thee also, Guest of our Folk!  Hast thou beenwandering about our meadows, and happened on me perchance?''Nay,' he said; 'I saw thee come forth from the House of the Steer,and I followed thee hither.'She reddened a little, and knit her brow, and said:'Thou wilt have something to say to me?''I have much to say to thee,' he said; 'yet it was sweet to me tobehold thee, even if I might not speak with thee.'She looked on him with her deep simple eyes, and neither reddenedagain, nor seemed wroth; then she said:'Speak what thou hast in thine heart, and I will hearken withoutanger whatsoever it may be; even if thou hast but to tell me of thepassing folly of a mighty man, which in a month or two he will notremember for sorrow or for joy.  Sit here beside me, and tell me thythought.'So he sat him adown and said:  'Yea, I have much to say to thee, butit is hard to me to say it.  But this I will say:  to-day andyesterday make the third time I have seen thee.  The first time thouwert happy and calm, and no shadow of trouble was on thee; the secondtime thine happy days were waning, though thou scarce knewest it; butto-day and yesterday thou art constrained by the bonds of grief, andwouldest loosen them if thou mightest.'She said:  'What meanest thou?  How knowest thou this?  How may astranger partake in my joy and my sorrow?'He said:  'As for yesterday, all the people might see thy grief andknow it.  But when I beheld thee the first time, I saw thee that thouwert more fair and lovely than all other women; and when I was awayfrom thee, the thought of thee and thine image were with me, and Imight not put them away; and oft at such and such a time I wonderedand said to myself, what is she doing now? though god wot I wasdealing with tangles and troubles and rough deeds enough.  But thesecond time I beheld thee, when I had looked to have great joy in thesight of thee, my heart was smitten with a pang of grief; for I sawthee hanging on the words and the looks of another man, who waslight-minded toward thee, and that thou wert troubled with theanguish of doubt and fear.  And he knew it not, nor saw it, though Isaw it.'Her face grew troubled, and the tearful passion stirred within her.But she held it aback, and said, as anyone might have said it:'How wert thou in the Dale, mighty man?  We saw thee not.'He said:  'I came hither hidden in other semblance than mine own.But meddle not therewith; it availeth nought.  Let me say this, anddo thou hearken to it.  I saw thee yesterday in the street, and thouwert as the ghost of thine old gladness; although belike thou haststriven with sorrow; for I see thee with a sword by thy side, and wehave been told that thou, O fairest of women, hast given thyself tothe Warrior to be his damsel.''Yea,' she said, 'that is sooth.'He went on:  'But the face which thou bearedst yesterday against thywill, amidst all the people, that was because thou hadst seen mysister the Sun-beam for the first time, and Face-of-god with her,hand clinging to hand, lip longing for lip, desire unsatisfied, butglad with all hope.'She laid hand upon hand in the lap of her gown, and looked down, andher voice trembled as she said:'Doth it avail to talk of this?'He said:  'I know not:  it may avail; for I am grieved, and shall bewhilst thou art grieved; and it is my wont to strive with my griefstill I amend them.'She turned to him with kind eyes and said:'O mighty man, canst thou clear away the tangle which besetteth thesoul of her whose hope hath bewrayed her?  Canst thou make hope growup in her heart?  Friend, I will tell thee that when I wed, I shallwed for the sake of the kindred, hoping for no joy therein.  Yea, orif by some chance the desire of man came again into my heart, Ishould strive with it to rid myself of it, for I should know of itthat it was but a wasting folly, that should but beguile me, andwound me, and depart, leaving me empty of joy and heedless of life.'He shook his head and said:  'Even so thou deemest now; but one dayit shall be otherwise.  Or dost thou love thy sorrow?  I tell thee,as it wears thee and wears thee, thou shalt hate it, and strive toshake it off.''Nay, nay,' she said; 'I love it not; for not only it grieveth me,but also it beateth me down and belittleth me.''Good is that,' said he.  'I know how strong thine heart is.  Now,wilt thou take mine hand, which is verily the hand of thy friend, andremember what I have told thee of my grief which cannot be sunderedfrom thine?  Shall we not talk more concerning this?  For surely Ishall soon see thee again, and often; since the Warrior, who lovethme belike, leadeth thee into fellowship with me.  Yea, I tell thee, Ofriend, that in that fellowship shalt thou find both the seed ofhope, and the sun of desire that shall quicken it.'Therewith he arose and stood before her, and held out to her his handall hardened with the sword-hilt, and she took it, and stood upfacing him, and said:'This much will I tell thee, O friend; that what I have said to theethis hour, I thought not to have said to any man; or to talk with aman of the grief that weareth me, or to suffer him to see my tears;and marvellous I deem it of thee, for all thy might, that thou hastdrawn this speech from out of me, and left me neither angry norashamed, in spite of these tears; and thou whom I have known not,though thou knewest me!'But now it were best that thou depart, and get thee home to theHouse of the Face, where I was once so frequent; for I wot that thouhast much to do; and as thou sayest, it will be in warfare that Ishall see thee.  Now I thank thee for thy words and the thought thouhast had of me, and the pain which thou hast taken to heal my hurt:I thank thee, I thank thee, for as grievous as it is to show one'shurts even to a friend.'He said:  'O Bride, I thank thee for hearkening to my tale; and oneday shall I thank thee much more.  Mayest thou fare well in the Fieldand amidst the Folk!'Therewith he kissed her hand, and turned away, and went across themeadow and the stream, glad at heart and blithe with everyone; forkindness grew in him as gladness grew.CHAPTER XXXVII.  OF THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE DALESMEN, THE SHEPHERD-FOLK,AND THE WOODLAND CARLES:  THE BANNER OF THE WOLF DISPLAYEDNow came the day of the Great Folk-mote, and there was much throngingfrom everywhere to the Mote-stead, but most from Burgstead itself,whereas few of the Dale-dwellers who had been at the Fair had goneback home.  Albeit some of the Shepherds and of the Dalesmen of thewesternmost Dale had brought light tents, and tilted themselves in inthe night before the Mote down in the meadows below the Mote-stead.From early morning there had been a stream of folk on the Portwaysetting westward; and many came thus early that they might holdconverse with friends and well-wishers; and some that they mightdisport them in the woods.  Men went in no ordered bands, as theBurgstead men at least had done on the day of the Weapon-show, savethat a few of them who were arrayed the bravest gathered about thebanners, and went with them to the Mote-stead; for all the bannersmust needs be there.The Folk-mote was to be hallowed-in three hours before noon, as allmen knew; therefore an hour before that time were all men of the Daleand the Shepherds assembled that might be looked for, save theAlderman and the chieftains with the banner of the Burg, and thesewere not like to come many minutes before the Hallowing.  Folk weregathered on the Field in such wise, that the men-at-arms made a greatring round about the Doom-ring, (albeit there were many old menthere, girt with swords that they should never heave up again inbattle), so that without that ring there was nought save women andchildren.  But when all the other Houses were assembled, men lookedaround, and beheld the place of the Woodlanders that it was empty;and they marvelled that they were thus belated.  For now all wasready, and a watcher had gone up to the Tower on the height, and hadwith him the great Horn of Warning, which could be heard past theMote-stead and a great way down the Dale:  and if he saw foes comingfrom the East he should blow one blast; if from the South, two; iffrom the West, three; if from the North, four.So half an hour from the appointed time of Hallowing rose the rumourthat the Alderman was on the road, and presently they of the womenwho were on the outside of the throng, by drawing nigh to the edge ofthe sheer rock, could behold the Banner of the Burg on the Portway,and soon after could see the wain, done about with green boughs,wherein sat the chieftains in their glittering war-gear.  Speedilythey spread the tidings, and a confused shout went up into the air;and in a little while the wain stayed on Wildlake's Way at the bottomof the steep slope that went up to the Mote-stead, and the banner ofthe Burg came on proudly up the hill.  Soon all men beheld it, andsaw that the tall Hall-face bore it in front of his brother Face-of-god, who came on gleaming in war-gear better than most men had seen;which was indeed of his father's fashioning, and his father's gift tohim that morning.After Face-of-god came the Alderman, and with him Folk-might leadingthe Sun-beam by the hand, and then Stone-face and the Elder of theDale-wardens; and then the six Burg-wardens:  as to the other Dale-wardens, they were in their places on the Field.So now those who had been standing up turned their faces toward theAltar of the Gods, and those who had been sitting down sprang totheir feet, and the confused rumour of the throng rose into a clearshout as the chieftains went to their places, and sat them down onthe turf-seats amidst the Doom-ring facing the Speech-hill and theAltar of the Gods.  Amidmost sat the Alderman, on his right handFace-of-god, and out from him Hall-face, and then Stone-face andthree of the Wardens; but on his left hand sat first the two Guests,then the Elder of the Dale-wardens, and then the other three Burg-wardens; as for the Banner of the Burg, its staff was stuck into theearth behind them, and the Banner raised itself in the morning windand flapped and rippled over their heads.There then they sat, and folk abided, and it still lacked someminutes of the due time, as the Alderman wotted by the shadow of thegreat standing-stone betwixt him and the Altar.  Therewithal came thesound of a great horn from out of the wood on the north side, and menknew it for the horn of the Woodland Carles, and were glad; for theycould not think why they should be belated; and now men stood up a-tiptoe and on other's shoulders to look over the heads of the womenand children to behold their coming; but their empty place was at thesouthwest corner of the ring of men.So presently men beheld them marching toward their place, cleavingthe throng of the women and children, a great company; for besidesthat they had with them two score more of men under weapons than onthe day of the Weapon-show, all their little ones and women andoutworn elders were with them, some on foot, some riding on oxen andasses.  In their forefront went the two signs of the Battle-shaft andthe War-spear.  But moreover, in front of all was borne a great staffwith the cloth of a banner wrapped round about it, and tied up with ahempen yarn that it might not be seen.Stark and mighty men they looked; tall and lean, broad-shouldered,dark-faced.  As they came amongst the throng the voice of their horndied out, and for a few moments they fared on with no sound save thetramp of their feet; then all at once the man who bare the hiddenbanner lifted up one hand, and straightway they fell to singing, andwith that song they came to their place.  And this is some of whatthey sang:O white, white Sun, what things of wonder   Hast thou beheld from thy wall of the sky!All the Roofs of the Rich and the grief thereunder,   As the fear of the Earl-folk flitteth by!Thou hast seen the Flame steal forth from the Forest   To slay the slumber of the lands,As the Dusky Lord whom thou abhorrest   Clomb up to thy Burg unbuilt with hands.Thou lookest down from thy door the golden,   Nor batest thy wide-shining mirth,As the ramparts fall, and the roof-trees olden   Lie smouldering low on the burning earth.When flitteth the half-dark night of summer   From the face of the murder great and grim,'Tis thou thyself and no new-comer   Shines golden-bright on the deed undim.Art thou our friend, O Day-dawn's Lover?   Full oft thine hand hath sent aslantBright beams athwart the Wood-bear's cover,   Where the feeble folk and the nameless haunt.Thou hast seen us quail, thou hast seen us cower,   Thou hast seen us crouch in the Green Abode,While for us wert thou slaying slow hour by hour,   And smoothing down the war-rough road.Yea, the rocks of the Waste were thy Dawns upheaving,   To let the days of the years go through;And thy Noons the tangled brake were cleaving   The slow-foot seasons' deed to do.Then gaze adown on this gift of our giving,   For the WOLF comes wending frith and ford,And the Folk fares forth from the dead to the living,   For the love of the Lief by the light of the Sword.Then ceased the song, and the whole band of the Woodlanders camepouring tumultuously into the space allotted them, like the waterspouring over a river-dam, their white swords waving aloft in themorning sunlight; and wild and strange cries rose up from amidstthem, with sobbing and weeping of joy.  But soon their troubled frontsank back into ordered ranks, their bright blades stood upright intheir hands before them, and folk looked on their company, and deemedit the very Terror of battle and Render of the ranks of war.  Rightwell were they armed; for though many of their weapons were ancientand somewhat worn, yet were they the work of good smiths of old days;and moreover, if any of them lacked good war-gear of his own, thathad the Alderman and his sons made good to them.But before the hedge of steel stood the two tall men who held intheir hands the war-tokens of the Battle-shaft and the War-spear, andbetwixt them stood one who was indeed the tallest man of the wholeassembly, who held the great staff of the hidden banner.  And now hereached up his hand, and plucked at the yarn that bound it, which ofset purpose was but feeble, and tore it off, and then shook the staffaloft with both hands, and shouted, and lo! the Banner of the Wolfwith the Sun-burst behind him, glittering-bright, new-woven by thewomen of the kindred, ran out in the fresh wind, and flapped andrippled before His warriors there assembled.Then from all over the Mote-stead arose an exceeding great shout, andall men waved aloft their weapons; but the men of Shadowy Vale whowere standing amidst the men of the Face knew not how to demeanthemselves, and some of them ran forth into the Field and leapt forjoy, tossing their swords into the air, and catching them by thehilts as they fell:  and amidst it all the Woodlanders now stoodsilent, unmoving, as men abiding the word of onset.As for that brother and sister:  the Sun-beam flushed red all overher face, and pressed her hands to her bosom, and then the passion oftears over-mastered her, and her breast heaved, and the tears gushedout of her eyes, and her body was shaken with weeping.  But Folk-might sat still, looking straight before him, his eyes glittering,his teeth set, his right hand clutching hard at the hilts of hissword, which lay naked across his knees.  And the Bride, who stoodclad in her begemmed and glittering war-array in the forefront of theMen of the Steer, nigh unto the seats of the chieftains, beheld Folk-might, and her face flushed and brightened, and still she looked uponhim.  The Alderman's face was as of one pleased and proud; yet wasits joy shadowed as it were by a cloud of compassion.  Face-of-godsat like the very image of the War-god, and stirred not, nor lookedtoward the Sun-beam; for still the thought of the after-grief ofbattle, and the death of friends and folk that loved him, lay heavyon his heart, for all that it beat wildly at the shouting of the men.CHAPTER XXXVIII.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE:  ATONEMENTS GIVEN, AND MENMADE SACKLESSAmidst the clamour uprose the Alderman; for it was clear to all menthat the Folk-mote should be holden at once, and the matters of theWar, and the Fellowship, and the choosing of the War-leader, speedilydealt with.  So the Alderman fell to hallowing in the Folk-mote:  hewent up to the Altar of the Gods, and took the Gold-ring off it, anddid it on his arm; then he drew his sword and waved it toward thefour airts, and spake; and the noise and shouting fell, and there wassilence but for him:'Herewith I hallow in this Folk-mote of the Men of the Dale and theSheepcotes and the Woodland, in the name of the Warrior and theEarth-god and the Fathers of the kindreds.  Now let not the peace ofthe Mote be broken.  Let not man rise against man, or bear blade orhand, or stick or stone against any.  If any man break the Peace ofthe Holy Mote, let him be a man accursed, a wild-beast in the HolyPlaces; an outcast from home and hearth, from bed and board, frommead and acre; not to be holpen with bread, nor flesh, nor wine; norflax, nor wool, nor any cloth; nor with sword, nor shield, nor axe,nor plough-share; nor with horse, nor ox, nor ass; with no saddle-beast nor draught-beast; nor with wain, nor boat, nor way-leading;nor with fire nor water; nor with any world's wealth.  Thus let himwho hath cast out man be cast out by man.  Now is hallowed-in theFolk-mote of the Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes and theWoodlands.'Therewith he waved his sword again toward the four airts, and wentand sat down in his place.  But presently he arose again, and said:'Now if man hath aught to say against man, and claimeth boot of any,or would lay guilt on any man's head, let him come forth and declareit; and the judges shall be named, and the case shall be tried thisafternoon or to-morrow.  Yet first I shall tell you that I, theAlderman of the Dalesmen, doomed one Iron-face of the House of theFace to pay a double fine, for that he drew a sword at the Gate-thingof Burgstead with the intent to break the peace thereof.  Thou,Green-sleeve, bring forth the peace-breaker's fine, that Iron-facemay lay the same on the Altar.'Then came forth a man from the men of the Face bearing a bag, and hebrought it to Iron-face, who went up to the Altar and poured forthweighed gold from the bag thereon, and said:'Warden of the Dale, come thou and weigh it!''Nay,' quoth the Warden, 'it needeth not, no man here doubteth thee,Alderman Iron-face.'A murmur of yeasay went up, and none had a word to say against theAlderman, but they praised him rather:  also men were eager to hearof the war, and the fellowship, and to be done with these pettymatters.  Then the Alderman rose again and said:'Hath any man a grief against any other of the Kindreds of the Dale,or the Sheepcotes, or the Woodlands?'None answered or stirred; so after he had waited a while, he said:'Is there any who hath any guilt to lay against a Stranger, anOutlander, being such a man as he deems we can come at?'Thereat was a stir amongst the Men of the Fleece of the Shepherds,and their ranks opened, and there came forth an ill-favoured lean oldman, long-nebbed, blear-eyed, and bent, girt with a rusty old sword,but not otherwise armed.  And all men knew Penny-thumb, who had beenransacked last autumn.  As he came forth, it seemed as if hisneighbours had been trying to hold him back; but a stout, broad-shouldered man, black-haired and red-bearded, made way for the oldman, and led him out of the throng, and stood by him; and this manwas well armed at all points, and looked a doughty carle.  He stoodside by side with Penny-thumb, right in front of the men of hishouse, and looked about him at first somewhat uneasily, as though hewere ashamed of his fellow; but though many smiled, none laughedaloud; and they forbore, partly because they knew the man to be agood man, partly because of the solemn tide of the Folk-mote, andpartly in sooth because they wished all this to be over, and were asmen who had no time for empty mirth.Then said the Alderman:  'What wouldest thou, Penny-thumb, and thou,Bristler, son of Brightling?'Then Penny-thumb began to speak in a high squeaky voice:'Alderman, and Lord of the Folk!'  But therewithal Bristle, pulledhim back, and said:'I am the man who hath taken this quarrel upon me, and have swornupon the Holy Boar to carry this feud through; and we deem, Alderman,that if they who slew Rusty and ransacked Penny-thumb be not knownnow, yet they soon may be.'As he spake, came forth those three men of the Shepherds and the twoDalesmen who had sworn with him on the Holy Boar.  Then up stoodFolk-might, and came forth into the field, and said:'Bristler, son of Brightling, and ye other good men and true, it isbut sooth that the ransackers and the slayer may soon be known; andhere I declare them unto you:  I it was and none other who slewRusty; and I was the leader of those who ransacked Penny-thumb, andcowed Harts-bane of Greentofts.  As for the slaying of Rusty, I slewhim because he chased me, and would not forbear, so that I musteither slay or be slain, as hath befallen me erewhile, and willbefall again, methinks.  As for the ransacking of Penny-thumb, Ineeded the goods that I took, and he needed them not, since heneither used them, nor gave them away, and, they being gone, he hathlived no worser than aforetime.  Now I say, that if ye will take theoutlawry off me, which, as I hear, ye laid upon me, not knowing me,then will I handsel self-doom to thee, Bristler, if thou wilt bearthy grief to purse, and I will pay thee what thou wilt out of hand;or if perchance thou wilt call me to Holm, thither will I go, if thouand I come unslain out of this war.  As to the ransacking and cowingof Harts-bane, I say that I am sackless therein, because the man isbut a ruffler and a man of violence, and hath cowed many men of theDale; and if he gainsay me, then do I call him to the Holm after thiswar is over; either him or any man who will take his place before mysword.'Then he held his peace, and man spake to man, and a murmur arose, asthey said for the more part that it was a fair and manly offer.  ButBristler called his fellows and Penny-thumb to him, and they spaketogether; and sometimes Penny-thumb's shrill squeak was heard abovethe deep-voiced talk of the others; for he was a man that harbouredmalice.  But at last Bristler spake out and said:'Tall man, we know that thou art a chieftain and of good will to themen of the Dale and their friends, and that want drave thee to theransacking, and need to the manslaying, and neither the living northe dead to whom thou art guilty are to be called good men; thereforewill I bring the matter to purse, if thou wilt handsel me self-doom.''Yea, even so let it be,' quoth Folk-might; and stepped forward andtook Bristler by the hand, and handselled him self-doom.  Then saidBristler:'Though Rusty was no good man, and though he followed thee to slaythee, yet was he in his right therein, since he was following up hisgoodman's gear; therefore shalt thou pay a full blood-wite for him,that is to say, the worth of three hundreds in weed-stuff in whatsogoods thou wilt.  As for the ransacking of Penny-thumb, he shall deemhimself well paid if thou give him our hundreds in weed-stuff forthat which thou didst borrow of him.'Then Penny-thumb set up his squeak again, but no man hearkened tohim, and each man said to his neighbour that it was well doomed ofBristler, and neither too much nor too little.  But Folk-might badeWood-wont to bring thither to him that which he had borne to theMote; and he brought forth a big sack, and Folk-might emptied it onthe earth, and lo! the silver rings of the slain felons, and they layin a heap on the green field, and they were the best of silver.  Thenthe Elder of the Dale-wardens weighed out from the heap the blood-wite for Rusty, according to the due measure of the hundred in weed-stuff, and delivered it unto Bristler.  And Folk-might said:'Draw nigh now, Penny-thumb, and take what thou wilt of this gear,which I need not, and grudge not at me henceforward.'But Penny-thumb was afraid, and abode where he was; and Bristlerlaughed, and said:  'Take it, goodman, take it; spare not other men'sgoods as thou dost thine own.'And Folk-might stood by, smiling faintly:  so Penny-thumb plucked upa heart, and drew nigh trembling, and took what he durst from thatheap; and all that stood by said that he had gotten a full double ofwhat had been awarded to him.  But as for him, he went his waysstraight from the Mote-stead, and made no stay till he had gotten himhome, and laid the silver up in a strong coffer; and thereafter hebewailed him sorely that he had not taken the double of that which hetook, since none would have said him nay.When he was gone, the Alderman arose and said:'Now, since the fines have been paid duly and freely, according tothe dooming of Bristler, take we off the outlawry from Folk-might andhis fellows, and account them to be sackless before us.'Then he called for other cases; but no man had aught more to bringforward against any man, either of the kindreds or the Strangers.CHAPTER XXXIX.  OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE:  MEN TAKE REDE OF THE WAR-FARING, THE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE WAR-LEADER.  FOLK-MIGHT TELLETHWHENCE HIS PEOPLE CAME.  THE FOLK-MOTE SUNDEREDNow a great silence fell upon the throng, and they stood as menabiding some new matter.  Unto them arose the Alderman, and said:'Men of the Dale, and ye Shepherds and Woodlanders; it is well knownto you that we have foemen in the wood and beyond it; and now have wegotten sure tidings, that they will not abide at home or in the wood,but are minded to fall upon us at home.  Now therefore I will not askyou whether ye will have peace or war; for with these foemen ye mayhave peace no otherwise save by war.  But if ye think with me, threethings have ye to determine:  first, whether ye will abide your foesin your own houses, or will go meet them at theirs; next, whether yewill take to you as fellows in arms a valiant folk of the children ofthe Gods, who are foemen to our foemen; and lastly, what man ye willhave to be your War-leader.  Now, I bid all those here assembled, tospeak hereof, any man of them that will, either what they may haveconceived in their own minds, or what their kindred may have put intotheir mouths to speak.'Therewith he sat down, and in a little while came forth old Hall-wardof the House of the Steer, and stood before the Alderman, and said:'O Alderman, all we say:  Since war is awake we will not tarry, butwill go meet our foes while it is yet time.  The valiant men of whomthou tellest shall be our fellows, were there but three of them.  Weknow no better War-leader than Face-of-god of the House of the Face.Let him lead us.'Therewith he went his ways; and next came forth War-well, and said:'The House of the Bridge would have Face-of-god for War-leader, thesetall men for fellows, and the shortest way to meet the foe.'  And hewent back to his place.Next came Fox of Upton, and said:  'Time presses, or much might bespoken.  Thus saith the House of the Bull:  Let us go meet the foe,and take these valiant strangers for way-leaders, and Face-of-god forWar-leader.'  And he also went back again.Then came forth two men together, an old man and a young, and the oldman spake as soon as he stood still:  'The Men of the Vine bid me saytheir will:  They will not stay at home to have their houses burnedover their heads, themselves slain on their own hearths, and theirwives haled off to thralldom.  They will take any man for theirfellow in arms who will smite stark strokes on their side.  They knowFace-of-god, and were liefer of him for War-leader than any other,and they will follow him wheresoever he leadeth.  Thus my kindredbiddeth me say, and I hight Fork-beard of Lea.  If I live throughthis war, I shall have lived through five.'Therewith he went back to his place; but the young man lifted up hisvoice and said:  'To all this I say yea, and so am I bidden by thekindred of the Sickle.  I am Red-beard of the Knolls, the son of myfather.'  And he went to his place again.Then came forth Stone-face, and said:  'The House of the Face saith:Lead us through the wood, O Face-of-god, thou War-leader, and yewarriors of the Wolf.  I am Stone-face, as men know, and this wordhath been given to me by the kindred.'  And he took his place again.Then came forth together the three chiefs of the Shepherds, to witHound-under-Greenbury, Strongitharm, and the Hyllier; andStrongitharm spake for all three, and said:'The Men of Greenbury, and they of the Fleece and the Thorn, are ofone accord, and bid us say that they are well pleased to have Face-of-god for War-leader; and that they will follow him and the warriorsof the Wolf to live or die with them; and that they are ready to gomeet the foe at once, and will not skulk behind the walls ofGreenbury.'Therewith the three went back again to their places.Then came forth that tall man that bare the Banner of the Wolf, whenhe had given the staff into the hands of him who stood next.  He cameand stood over against the seat of the chieftains; and for a while hecould say no word, but stood struggling with the strong passion ofhis joy; but at last he lifted his hands aloft, and cried out in aloud voice:'O war, war!  O death!  O wounding and grief!  O loss of friends andkindred! let all this be rather than the drawing back of meetinghands and the sundering of yearning hearts!' and he went back hastilyto his place.  But from the ranks of the Woodlanders ran forth ayoung man, and cried out:'As is the word of Red-wolf, so is my word, Bears-bane of Carlstead;and this is the word which our little Folk hath put into our mouths;and O! that our hands may show the meaning of our mouths; for noughtelse can.'Then indeed went up a great shout, though many forebore to cry out;for now were they too much moved for words or sounds.  And in specialwas Face-of-god moved; and he scarce knew which way to look, lest heshould break out into sobs and weeping; for of late he had been muchamong the Woodlanders, and loved them much.Then all the noise and clamour fell, and it was to men as if they whohad come thither a folk, had now become an host of war.But once again the Alderman rose up and spake:'Now have ye yeasaid three things:  That we take Face-of-god of theHouse of the Face for our War-leader; that we fare under weapons atonce against them who would murder us; and that we take the valiantFolk of the Wolf for our fellows in arms.'Therewith he stayed his speech, and this time the shout arose clearand most mighty, with the tossing up of swords and the clashing ofweapons on shields.Then he said:  'Now, if any man will speak, here is the War-leader,and here is the chief of our new friends, to answer to whatso any ofthe kindred would have answered.'Thereon came forth the Fiddle from amongst the Men of the Sickle, anddrew somewhat nigh to the Alderman, and said:'Alderman, we would ask of the War-leader if he hath devised themanner of our assembling, and the way of our war-faring, and the dayof our hosting.  More than this I will not ask of him, because we wotthat in so great an assembly it may be that the foe may have some spyof whom we wot not; and though this be not likely, yet some folk maybabble; therefore it is best for the wise to be wise everywhere andalways.  Therefore my rede it is, that no man ask any more concerningthis, but let it lie with the War-leader to bring us face to facewith the foe as speedily as he may.'All men said that this was well counselled.  But Face-of-god aroseand said:  'Ye Men of the Dale, ye Shepherds and Woodlanders,meseemeth the Fiddle hath spoken wisely.  Now therefore I answer himand say, that I have so ordered everything since the Gate-thing washolden at Burgstead, that we may come face to face with the foemen bythe shortest of roads.  Every man shall be duly summoned to theHosting, and if any man fail, let it be accounted a shame to him forever.'A great shout followed on his words, and he sat down again.  But Foxof Upton came forth and said:'O Alderman, we have yeasaid the fellowship of the valiant men whohave come to us from out of the waste; but this we have done, notbecause we have known them, otherwise than by what our kinsman Face-of-god hath told us concerning them, but because we have seen clearlythat they will be of much avail to us in our warfare.  Now,therefore, if the tall chieftain who sitteth beside thee were to dous to wit what he is, and whence he and his are come, it were well,and fain were we thereof; but if he listeth not to tell us, that alsoshall be well.'Then arose Folk-might in his place; but or ever he could open hismouth to speak, the tall Red-wolf strode forward bearing with him theBanner of the Wolf and the Sun-burst, and came and stood beside him;and the wind ran through the folds of the banner, and rippled it outabove the heads of those twain.  Then Folk-might spake and said:'O Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes, I will do as ye bid me do;And fain were ye of the story if every deal ye knew.But long, long were its telling, were I to tell it all:Let it bide till the Cup of Deliverance ye drink from hall to hall.'Like you we be of the kindreds, of the Sons of the Gods we come,Midst the Mid-earth's mighty Woodland of old we had our home;But of older time we abided 'neath the mountains of the Earth,O'er which the Sun ariseth to waken woe and mirth.Great were we then and many; but the long days wore us thin,And war, wherein the winner hath weary work to win.And the woodland wall behind us e'en like ourselves was worn,And the tramp of the hosts of the foemen adown its glades was borneOn the wind that bent our wheat-fields.  So in the morn we rose,And left behind the stubble and the autumn-fruited close,And went our ways to the westward, nor turned aback to seeThe glare of our burning houses rise over brake and tree.But the foe was fierce and speedy, nor long they tarried there,And through the woods of battle our laden wains must fare;And the Sons of the Wolf were minished, and the maids of the Wolfwaxed few,As amidst the victory-singing we fared the wild-wood through.'So saith the ancient story, that west and west we went,And many a day of battle we had in brake, on bent;Whilst here a while we tarried, and there we hastened on,And still the battle-harvest from many a folk we won.'Of the tale of the days who wotteth?  Of the years what man cantell,While the Sons of the Wolf were wandering, and knew not where todwell?But at last we clomb the mountains, and mickle was our toil,As high the spear-wood clambered of the drivers of the spoil;And tangled were the passes and the beacons flared behind,And the horns of gathering onset came up upon the wind.So saith the ancient story, that we stood in a mountain-cleft,Where the ways and the valleys sundered to the right hand and theleft.There in the place of sundering all woeful was the rede;We knew no land before us, and behind was heavy need.As the sword cleaves through the byrny, so there the mountain flankCleft through the God-kin's people; and ne'er again we drankThe wine of war together, or feasted side by sideIn the Feast-hall of the Warrior on the fruit of the battle-tide.For there we turned and sundered; unto the North we wentAnd up along the waters, and the clattering stony bent;And unto the South and the Sheepcotes down went our sister's sons;And O for the years passed over since we saw those valiant ones!'He ceased, and laid his right hand on the banner-staff a little belowthe left hand of Red-wolf; and men were so keen to hear each wordthat he spake, that there was no cry nor sound of voices when he haddone, only the sound of the rippling banner of the Wolf over theheads of those twain.  The Sun-beam bowed her head now, and weptsilently.  But the Bride, she had drawn her sword, and held itupright in her hand before her, and the sun smote fire from out ofit.Then it was but a little while before Red-wolf lifted up his voice,and sang:'Hearken a wonder, O Folk of the Field,How they that did sunder stand shield beside shield!Lo! the old wont and manner by fearless folk made,On the Bole of the Banner the brothers' hands laid.Lo! here the token of what hath betid!Grown whole is the broken, found that which was hid.Now one way we follow whate'er shall befall;As seeketh the swallow his yesteryear's hall.Seldom folk fewer to fight-stead hath fared;Ne'er have men truer the battle-reed bared.Grey locks now I carry, and old am I grown,Nor looked I to tarry to meet with mine own.For we who remember the deeds of old daysWere nought but the ember of battle ablaze.For what man might aid us? what deed and what dayShould come where Weird laid us aloof from the way?What man save that other of Twain rent apart,Our war-friend, our Brother, the piece of our heart.Then hearken the wonder how shield beside shieldThe twain that did sunder wend down to the Field!'Now when he had made an end, men could no longer forebear the shout;and it went up into the heavens, and was borne by the west-wind downthe Dale to the ears of the stay-at-home women and men unmeet to goabroad, and it quickened their blood and the spirits within them asthey heard it, and they smiled and were fain; for they knew thattheir kinsfolk were glad.But when there was quiet on the Mote-field again, Folk-might spakeagain and said;'It is sooth that my Brother sayeth, and that now again we wend,All the Sons of the Wolf together, till the trouble hath an end.But as for that tale of the Ancients, it saith that we who wentTo the northward, climbed and stumbled o'er many a stony bent,Till we happed on that isle of the waste-land, and the grass ofShadowy Vale,Where we dwelt till we throve a little, and felt our might avail.Then we fared abroad from the shadow and the little-lighted hold,And the increase fell to the valiant, and the spoil to the battle-bold,And never a man gainsaid us with the weapons in our hands;And in Silver-dale the happy we gat us life and lands.'So wore the years o'er-wealthy; and meseemeth that ye knowHow we sowed and reaped destruction, and the Day of the overthrow:How we leaned on the staff we had broken, and put our lives in thehandOf those whom we had vanquished and the feeble of the land;And these were the stone of stumbling, and the burden not to beborne,When the battle-blast fell on us and our day was over-worn.Thus then did our wealth bewray us, and left us wise and sad;And to you, bold men, it falleth once more to make us glad,If so your hearts are bidding, and ye deem the deed of worth.Such were we; what we shall be, 'tis yours to say henceforth.'He said furthermore:  'How great we have been I have told youalready; and ye shall see for yourselves how little we be now.  Is itenough, and will ye have us for friends and brothers?  How say ye?'They answered with shout upon shout, so that all the place and thewild-wood round about was full of the voice of their crying; but whenthe clamour fell, then spake the Alderman and said:'Friend, and chieftain of the Wolf, thou mayst hear by this shoutingof the people that we have no mind to naysay our yea-say.  And knowthat it is not our use and manner to seek the strong for friends, andto thrust aside the weak; but rather to choose for our friends themwho are of like mind to us, men in whom we put our trust.  Fromhenceforth then there is brotherhood between us; we are yours, and yeare ours; and let this endure for ever!'Then were all men full of joy; and now at last the battle seemed athand, and the peace beyond the battle.Then men brought the hallowed beasts all garlanded with flowers intothe Doom-ring, and there were they slain and offered up unto theGods, to wit the Warrior, the Earth-god, and the Fathers; andthereafter was solemn feast holden on the Field of the Folk-mote, andall men were fain and merry.  Nevertheless, not all men abode therethe feast through; for or ever the afternoon was well worn, were manymen wending along the Portway eastward toward the Upper Dale, eachman in his war-gear and with a scrip hung about him; and these werethey who were bound for the trysting-place and the journey over thewaste.So the Folk-mote was sundered; and men went to their houses, andthere abode in peace the time of their summoning; since they wottedwell that the Hosting was afoot.But as for the Woodlanders, who were at the Mote-stead with all theirfolk, women, children, and old men, they went not back again toCarlstead; but prayed the neighbours of the Middle Dale to sufferthem to abide there awhile, which they yeasaid with a good will.  Sothe Woodlanders tilted themselves in, the more part of them, down inthe meadows below the Mote-stead, along either side of Wildlake'sWay; but their ancient folk, and some of the women and children, theneighbours would have into their houses, and the rest they furnishedwith victual and all that they needed without price, looking uponthem as their very guests.  For indeed they deemed that they couldsee that these men would never return to Carlstead, but would abidewith the Men of the Wolf in Silver-dale, once it were won.  And thisthey deemed but meet and right, yet were they sorry thereof; for theWoodlanders were well beloved of all the Dalesmen; and now that theyhad gotten to know that they were come of so noble a kindred, theywere better beloved yet, and more looked upon.CHAPTER XL.  OF THE HOSTING IN SHADOWY VALEIt was on the evening of the fourth day after the Folk-mote thatthere came through the Waste to the rocky edge of Shadowy Vale a bandof some fifteen score of men-at-arms, and with them a multitude ofwomen and children and old men, some afoot, some riding on asses andbullocks; and with them were sumpter asses and neat laden withhousehold goods, and a few goats and kine.  And this was the wholefolk of the Woodlanders come to the Hosting in Shadowy Vale and theHome of the Children of the Wolf.  Their leaders of the way wereWood-father and Wood-wont and two other carles of Shadowy Vale; andRed-wolf the tall, and Bears-bane and War-grove were the captains andchieftains of their company.Thus then they entered into the narrow pass aforesaid, which was theingate to the Vale from the Waste, and little by little its dimnessswallowed up their long line.  As they went by the place where thelowering of the rock-wall gave a glimpse of the valley, they lookeddown into it as Face-of-god had done, but much change was there inlittle time.  There was the black wall of crags on the other sidestretching down to the ghyll of the great Force; there ran the deepgreen waters of the Shivering Flood; but the grass which Face-of-godhad seen naked of everything but a few kine, thereon now the tents ofmen stood thick.  Their hearts swelled within them as they beheld it,but they forebore the shout and the cry till they should be wellwithin the Vale, and so went down silently into the darkness.  But astheir eyes caught that dim image of the Wolf on the wall of the pass,man pointed it out to man, and not a few turned and kissed ithurriedly; and to them it seemed that many a kiss had been laid onthat dear token since the days of old, and that the hard stone hadbeen worn away by the fervent lips of men, and that the air of themirk place yet quivered with the vows sworn over the sword-blade.But down through the dark they went, and so came on to the stonyscree at the end of the pass and into the Vale; and the whole Folksave the three chieftains flowed over it and stood about it down onthe level grass of the Vale.  But those three stood yet on the top ofthe scree, bearing the war-signs of the Shaft and the Spear, andbetwixt them the banner of the Wolf and the Sunburst newly displayedto the winds of Shadowy Vale.Up and down the Vale they looked, and saw before the tents of men theold familiar banners of Burgdale rising and falling in the eveningwind.  But amidst of the Doom-ring was pitched a great banner,whereon was done the image of the Wolf with red gaping jaws on afield of green; and about him stood other banners, to wit, The SilverArm on a red field, the Red Hand on a white field, and on greenfields both, the Golden Bushel and the Ragged Sword.All about the plain shone glittering war-gear of men as they movedhither and thither, and a stream of folk began at once to draw towardthe scree to look on those new-comers; and amidst the helmedBurgdalers and the white-coated Shepherds went the tall men of theWolf, bare-headed and unarmed save for their swords, mingled with thefair strong women of the kindred, treading barefoot the soft grass oftheir own Vale.Presently there was a great throng gathered round about theWoodlanders, and each man as he joined it waved hand or weapon towardthem, and the joy of their welcome sent a confused clamour throughthe air.  Then forth from the throng stepped Folk-might, unarmed savehis sword, and behind him was Face-of-god, in his war-gear save hishelm, hand in hand with the Sun-beam, who was clad in her goodlyflowered green kirtle, her feet naked like her sisters of thekindred.Then Folk-might cried aloud:  'A full and free greeting to ourbrothers!  Well be ye, O Sons of our Ancient Fathers!  And to-day areye the dearer to us because we see that ye have brought us a gift, towit, your wives and children, and your grandsires unmeet for war.  Bythis token we see how great is your trust in us, and that it is yourmeaning never to sunder from us again.  O well be ye; well be ye!'Then spake Red-wolf, and said:  'Ye Sons of the Wolf, who parted fromus of old time in that cleft of the mountains, it is our very selvesthat we give unto you; and these are a part of ourselves; how thenshould we leave them behind us?  Bear witness, O men of Burgdale andthe Sheepcotes, that we have become one Folk with the men of ShadowyVale, never to be sundered again!'Then all that multitude shouted with a loud voice; and when the shouthad died away, Folk-might spake again:'O Warriors of the Sundering, here shall your wives and childrenabide, while we go a little journey to rejoice our hearts with thehard handplay, and take to us that which we have missed:  and to-morrow morn is appointed for this same journey, unless ye be overfoot-weary with the ways of the Waste.'Red-wolf smiled as he answered:  'This ye say in jest, brother; forye may see that our day's journey hath not been over-much for our oldmen; how then should it weary those who may yet bear sword?  We areready for the road and eager for the handplay.''This is well,' said Folk-might, 'and what was to be looked for.Therefore, brother, do ye and your counsel-mates come straightway tothe Hall of the Wolf; wherein, after ye have eaten and drunken, shallwe take counsel with our brethren of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, sothat all may be ordered for battle!'Said Red-wolf:  'Good is that, if we must needs abide till to-morrow;for verily we came not hither to eat and drink and rest our bodies;but it must be as ye will have it.'Then the Sun-beam left the hand of Face-of-god and came forward, andheld out both her palms to the Woodland-folk, and spake in a voicethat was heard afar, though it were a woman's, so clear and sweet itwas; and she said:'O Warriors of the Sundering, ye who be not needed in the Hall, andye our sisters with your little ones and your fathers, come now to usand down to the tents which we have arrayed for you, and there thinkfor a little that we are all at our very home that we long for andhave yet to win, and be ye merry with us and make us merry.'Therewith she stepped forward daintily and entered into their throng,and took an old man of the Woodlanders by the hand, and kissed hischeek and led him away, and the coming rest seemed sweet to him.  Andthen came other women of the Vale, kind and fair and smiling, and ledaway, some an old mother of the Wood-landers, some a young wife, somea pair of lads; and not a few forsooth kissed and embraced the starkwarriors, and went away with them toward the tents, which stood alongthe side of the Shivering Flood where it was at its quietest; forthere was the grass the softest and most abundant.  There on thegreen grass were tables arrayed, and lamps were hung above them onspears, to be litten when the daylight should fail.  And the best ofthe victual which the Vale could give was spread on the boards, alongwith wine and dainties, bought in Silver-dale, or on the edges of theWestland with sword-strokes and arrow-flight.There then they feasted and were merry; and the Sun-beam and Bow-mayand the other women of the Vale served them at table, and were veryblithe with them, caressing them with soft words, and with clippingand kissing, as folk who were grown exceeding dear to them; so thatthat eve of battle was softer and sweeter to them than any hour oftheir life.  With these feasters were God-swain and Spear-fist of thedelivered thralls of Silver-dale as glad as glad might be; but Wolf-stone their eldest was gone with Dallach to the Council in the Hall.The men of Burgdale and the Shepherds feasted otherwhere in allcontent, nor lacked folk of the Vale to serve them.  Amongst the menof the Face were the ten delivered thralls who had heart to meettheir masters in arms:  seven of them were of Rose-dale and three ofSilver-dale.The Bride was with her kindred of the Steer, with whom were many menof Shadowy Vale, and she served her friends and fellows clad in herwar-gear, save helm and hauberk, bearing herself as one who isserving dear guests.  And men equalled her for her beauty to the Godsof the High Place and the Choosers of the Slain; and they who had notbeheld her before marvelled at her, and her loveliness held all men'shearts in a net of desire, so that they forebore their meat to gazeupon her; and if perchance her hand touched some young man, or hercheek or sweet-breathed mouth came nigh to his face, he becamebewildered and wist not where he was, nor what to do.  Yet was she aslowly and simple of speech and demeanour as if she were a gooseherdof fourteen winters.In the Hall was a goodly company, and all the leaders of the Folkwere therein, and Folk-might and the War-leader sitting in the midstof those stone seats on the days.  There then they agreed on thewhole ordering of the battle and the wending of the host, as shall betold later on; and this matter was long a-doing, and when it wasdone, men went to their places to sleep, for the night was well worn.But when men had departed and all was still, Folk-might, light-cladand without a weapon, left the Hall and walked briskly toward thenether end of the Vale.  He passed by all the tents, the last whereofwere of the House of the Steer, and came to a place where was a greatrock rising straight up from the plain like sheaves of black stavesstanding close together; and it was called Staff-stone, and tales ofthe elves had been told concerning it, so that Stone-face had beheldit gladly the day before.The moon was just shining into Shadowy Vale, and the grass was brightwheresoever the shadows of the high cliffs were not, and the face ofStaff-stone shone bright grey as Folk-might came within sight of it,and he beheld someone sitting at the base of the rock, and as he drewnigher he saw that it was a woman, and knew her for the Bride; for hehad prayed her to abide him there that night, because it was nigh tothe tents of the House of the Steer; and his heart was glad as hedrew nigh to her.She sat quietly on a fragment of the black rock, clad as she had beenall day, in her glittering kirtle, but without hauberk or helm, awreath of wind-flowers about her head, her feet crossed over eachother, her hands laid palm uppermost in her lap.  She moved not as hedrew nigh, but said in a gentle voice when he was close to her:'Chief of the Wolf, great warrior, thou wouldest speak with me; andgood it is that friends should talk together on the eve of battle,when they may never meet alive again.'He said:  'My talk shall not be long; for thou and I both must sleepto-night, since there is work to hand to-morrow.  Now since, as thousayest, O fairest of women, we may never meet again alive, I ask theenow at this hour, when we both live and are near to one another, tosuffer me to speak to thee of my love of thee and desire for thee.Surely thou, who art the sweetest of all things the Gods and thekindreds have made, wilt not gainsay me this?'She said very sweetly, yet smiling:  'Brother of my father's sons,how can I gainsay thee thy speech?  Nay, hast thou not said it?  Whatmore canst thou add to it that will have fresh meaning to mine ears?'He said:  'Thou sayest sooth:  might I then but kiss thine hand?'She said, no longer smiling:  'Yea surely, even so may all men do whocan be called my friends--and thou art much my friend.'He took her hand and kissed it, and held it thereafter; nor did shedraw it away.  The moon shone brightly on them; but by its light hecould not see if she reddened, but he deemed that her face wastroubled.  Then he said:  'It were better for me if I might kiss thyface, and take thee in mine arms.'Then said she:  'This only shall a man do with me when I long to dothe like with him.  And since thou art so much my friend, I will tellthee that as for this longing, I have it not.  Bethink thee what alittle while it is since the lack of another man's love grieved mesorely.''The time is short,' said Folk-might, 'if we tell up the hoursthereof; but in that short space have a many things betid.'She said:  'Dost thou know, canst thou guess, how sorely ashamed Iwent amongst my people?  I durst look no man in the face for theaching of mine heart, which methought all might see through my face.''I knew it well,' he said; 'yet of me wert thou not ashamed but alittle while ago, when thou didst tell me of thy grief.'She said:  'True it is; and thou wert kind to me.  Thou didst becomea dear friend to me, methought.''And wilt thou hurt a dear friend?' said he.'O no,' she said, 'if I might do otherwise.  Yet how if I might notchoose?  Shall there be no forgiveness for me then?'He answered nothing; and still he held her hand that strove not to begone from his, and she cast down her eyes.  Then he spake in a while:'My friend, I have been thinking of thee and of me; and now hearken:if thou wilt declare that thou feelest no sweetness embracing thineheart when I say that I desire thee sorely, as now I say it; or whenI kiss thine hand, as now I kiss it; or when I pray thee to suffer meto cast mine arms about thee and kiss thy face, as now I pray it:  ifthou wilt say this, then will I take thee by the hand straightway,and lead thee to the tents of the House of the Steer, and sayfarewell to thee till the battle is over.  Canst thou say this out ofthe truth of thine heart?'She said:  'What then if I cannot say this word?  What then?'But he answered nothing; and she sat still a little while, and thenarose and stood before him, looking him in the eyes, and said:'I cannot say it.'Then he caught her in his arms and strained her to him, and thenkissed her lips and her face again and again, and she strove not withhim.  But at last she said:'Yet after all this shalt thou lead me back to my folk straight-way;and when the battle is done, if both we are living, then shall wespeak more thereof.'So he took her hand and led her on toward the tents of the Steer, andfor a while he spake nought; for he doubted himself, what he shouldsay; but at last he spake:'Now is this better for me than if it had not been, whether I live orwhether I die.  Yet thou hast not said that thou lovest me anddesirest me.''Wilt thou compel me?' she said.  'To-night I may not say it.  Whoshall say what words my lips shall fashion when we stand togethervictorious in Silver-dale; then indeed may the time seem long fromnow.'He said:  'Yea, true is that; yet once again I say that so measuredlong and long is the time since first I saw thee in Burgdale beforethou knewest me.  Yet now I will not bicker with thee, for be surethat I am glad at heart.  And lo you! our feet have brought us to thetents of thy people.  All good go with thee!''And with thee, sweet friend,' she said.  Then she lingered a little,turning her head toward the tents, and then turned her face towardhim and laid her hand on his neck, and drew his head adown to her andkissed his cheek, and therewith swiftly and lightly departed fromhim.Now the night wore and the morning came; and Face-of-god was abroadvery early in the morning, as his custom was; and he washed the nightfrom off him in the Carles' Bath of the Shivering Flood, and thenwent round through the encampment of the host, and saw none stirringsave here and there the last watchmen of the night.  He spake withone or two of these, and then went up to the head of the Vale, wherewas the pass that led to Silver-dale; and there he saw the watch, andspake with them, and they told him that none had as yet come forthfrom the pass, and he bade them to blow the horn of warning to rouseup the Host as soon as the messengers came thence.  For forerunnershad been sent up the pass, and had been set to hold watch at diversplaces therein to pass on the word from place to place.Thence went Face-of-god back toward the Hall; but when he was yetsome way from it, he saw a slender glittering warrior come forth fromthe door thereof, who stood for a moment looking round about, andthen came lightly and swiftly toward him; and lo! it was the Sun-beam, with a long hauberk over her kirtle falling below her knees, ahelm on her head and plated shoes on her feet.  She came up to him,and laid her hand to his cheek and the golden locks of his head (forhe was bare-headed), and said to him, smiling:'Gold-mane! thou badest me bear arms, and Folk-might also constrainedme thereto.  Lo thou!'Said Face-of-god:  'Folk-might is wise then, even as I am; andforsooth as thou art.  For bethink thee if the bow drawn at a ventureshould speed the eyeless shaft against thy breast, and send me fortha wanderer from my Folk!  For how could I bear the sight of the fairDale, and no hope to see thee again therein?'She said:  'The heart is light within me to-day.  Deemest thou thatthis is strange?  Or dost thou call to mind that which thou spakestthe other day, that it was of no avail to stand in the Doom-ring ofthe Folk and bear witness against ourselves?  This will I not.  Thisis no light-mindedness that thou beholdest in me, but the valiancythat the Fathers have set in mine heart.  Deem not, O Gold-mane, fearnot, that we shall die before they dight the bride-bed for us.'He would have kissed her mouth, but she put him away with her hand,and doffed her helm and laid it on the grass, and said:'This is not the last time that thou shalt kiss me, Gold-mane, mydear; and yet I long for it as if it were, so high as the Fathershave raised me up this morn above fear and sadness.'He said nought, but drew her to him, and wonder so moved him, that helooked long and closely at her face before he kissed her; andforsooth he could find no blemish in it:  it was as if it were butnew come from the smithy of the Gods, and exceeding longing took holdof him.  But even as their lips met, from the head of the Vale camethe voice of the great horn; and it was answered straightway by thewatchers all down the tents; and presently arose the shouts of menand the clash of weapons as folk armed themselves, and laughtertherewith, for most men were battle-merry, and the cries of womenshrilly-clear as they hastened about, busy over the morning mealbefore the departure of the Host.  But Face-of-god said softly, stillcaressing the Sun-beam, and she him:'Thus then we depart from this Valley of the Shadows, but as thousaidst when first we met therein, there shall be no sundering of theeand me, but thou shalt go down with me to the battle.'And he led her by the hand into the Hall of the Wolf, and there theyate a morsel, and thereafter Face-of-god tarried not, but busiedhimself along with Folk-might and the other chieftains in arrayingthe Host for departure.CHAPTER XLI.  THE HOST DEPARTETH FROM SHADOWY VALE:  THE FIRST DAY'SJOURNEYIt was about three hours before noon that the Host began to enterinto the pass out of Shadowy Vale by the river-side; and the womenand children, and men unfightworthy, stood on the higher ground atthe foot of the cliffs to see the Host wend on the way.  Of these amany were of the Woodlanders, who were now one folk with them ofShadowy Vale.  And all these had chosen to abide tidings in the Vale,deeming that there was little danger therein, since that lastslaughter which Folk-might had made of the Dusky Men; albeit Face-of-god had offered to send them all to Burgstead with two score and tenmen-at-arms to guard them by the way and to eke out the warders ofthe Burg.Now the fighting-men of Shadowy Vale were two long hundreds lackingfive; of whom two score and ten were women, and three score and tenlads under twenty winters; but the women, though you might scarce seefairer of face and body, were doughty in arms, all good shooters inthe bow; and the swains were eager and light-foot, cragsmen of thebest, wont to scaling the cliffs of the Vale in search of the nestsof gerfalcons and such-like fowl, and swimming the strong streams ofthe Shivering Flood; tough bodies and wiry, stronger than most grownmen, and as fearless as the best.The order of the Departure of the Host was this:The Woodlanders went first into the pass, and with them were twoscore of the ripe Warriors of the Wolf.  Then came of the kindreds ofBurgdale, the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull; then theMen of the Vine and the Sickle; then the Shepherd-folk; and lastly,the Men of the Face led by Stone-face and Hall-face.  With these wentanother two score of the dwellers in Shadowy Vale, and the rest werescattered up and down the bands of the Host to guide them into thebest paths and to make the way easier to them.  Face-of-god wassundered from his kindred, and went along with Folk-might in theforefront of the Host, while his father the Alderman went as a simpleman-at-arms with his House in the rearward.  The Sun-beam followedher brother and Face-of-god amidst the Warriors of the Wolf, and withher were Bow-may clad in the Alderman's gift, and Wood-father and hischildren.  Bow-may had caused her to doff her hauberk for that day,whereon they looked to fall in with no foeman.  As for the Bride, shewent with her kindred in all her war-gear; and the morning sun shonein the gems of her apparel, and her jewelled feet fell like flowersupon the deep grass of the upper Vale, and shone strange and brightamongst the black stones of the pass.  She bore a quiver at her backand a shining yew bow in her hand, and went amongst the bowmen, forshe was a very deft archer.So fared they into the pass, leaving peace behind them, with alltheir banners displayed, and the banner of the Red-mouthed Wolf wentwith the Wolf and the Sun-burst in the forefront of their battle nextafter the two captains.As for their road, the grassy space between the rock-wall and thewater was wide and smooth at first, and the cliffs rose up likebundles of spear-shafts high and clear from the green grass with noconfused litter of fallen stones; so that the men strode on briskly,their hearts high-raised and full of hope.  And as they went, thesweetness of song stirred in their souls, and at last Bow-may fell tosinging in a loud clear voice, and her cousin Wood-wise answered her,and all the warriors of the Wolf who were in their band fell into thesong at the ending, and the sound of their melody went down the waterand reached the ears of those that were entering the pass, and ofthose who were abiding till the way should be clear of them:  andthis is some of what they sang:Bow-may singeth:Hear ye never a voice come crying   Out from the waste where the winds fare wide?'Sons of the Wolf, the days are dying,   And where in the clefts of the rocks do ye hide?'Into your hands hath the Sword been given,   Hard are the palms with the kiss of the hilt;Through the trackless waste hath the road been riven   For the blade to seek to the heart of the guilt.'And yet ye bide and yet ye tarry;   Dear deem ye the sleep 'twixt hearth and board,And sweet the maiden mouths ye marry,   And bright the blade of the bloodless sword.'Wood-wise singeth:Yea, here we dwell in the arms of our Mother   The Shadowy Queen, and the hope of the Waste;Here first we came, when never another   Adown the rocky stair made haste.Far is the foe, and no sword beholdeth   What deed we work and whither we wend;Dear are the days, and the Year enfoldeth   The love of our life from end to end.Voice of our Fathers, why will ye move us,   And call up the sun our swords to behold?Why will ye cry on the foeman to prove us?   Why will ye stir up the heart of the bold?Bow-may singeth:Purblind am I, the voice of the chiding;   Then tell me what is the thing ye bear?What is the gift that your hands are hiding,   The gold-adorned, the dread and dear?Wood-wise singeth:Dark in the sheath lies the Anvil's Brother,   Hid is the hammered Death of Men.Would ye look on the gift of the green-clad Mother?   How then shall ye ask for a gift again?The Warriors sing:Show we the Sunlight the Gift of the Mother,   As foot follows foot to the foeman's den!Gleam Sun, breathe Wind, on the Anvil's Brother,   For bare is the hammered Death of Men.Therewith they shook their naked swords in the air, and fared oneagerly, and as swiftly as the pass would have them fare.  But so itwas, that when the rearward of the Host was entering the first of thepass, and was going on the wide smooth sward, the vanward was gottento where there was but a narrow space clear betwixt water and cliff;for otherwhere was a litter of great rocks and small, hard to bethreaded even by those who knew the passes well; so that men had totread along the very verge of the Shivering Flood, and wary must theybe, for the water ran swift and deep betwixt banks of sheer rock halfa fathom below their very foot-soles, which had but bare space to goon the narrow a way.  So it held on for a while, and then got safer,and there was more space for going betwixt cliff and flood; albeit itwas toilsome enough, since for some way yet there was a drift ofstones to cumber their feet, some big and some little, and some verybig.  After a while the way grew better, though here and there, wherethe cliffs lowered, were wide screes of loose stones that they mustneeds climb up and down.  Thereafter for a space was there an end ofthe stony cumber, but the way betwixt the river and the cliffsnarrowed again, and the black crags grew higher, and at last soexceeding high, and the way so narrow, that the sky overhead was tothem as though they were at the bottom of a well, and men deemed thatthence they could see the stars at noontide.  For some time withalhad the way been mounting up and up, though the cliffs grew higherover it; till at last they were but going on a narrow shelf, theShivering Flood swirling and rattling far below them betwixt sheerrock-walls grown exceeding high; and above them the cliffs going uptowards the heavens as black as a moonless starless night of winter.And as the flood thundered below, so above them roared the ceaselessthunder of the wind of the pass, that blew exceeding fierce down thatstrait place; so that the skirts of their garments were wrapped abouttheir knees by it, and their feet were well-nigh stayed at whiles asthey breasted the push thereof.But as they mounted higher and higher yet, the noise of the watersswelled into a huge roar that drowned the bellowing of the prisonedwind, and down the pass came drifting a fine rain that fell not fromthe sky, for between the clouds of that drift could folk see theheavens bright and blue above them.  This rain was but the spray ofthe great force up to whose steps they were climbing.Now the way got rougher as they mounted; but this toil was caused bytheir gain; for the rock-wall, which thrust out a buttress there asif it would have gone to the very edge of the gap where-through theflood ran, and so have cut the way off utterly, was here somewhatbroken down, and its stones scattered down the steep bent, so thatthere was a passage, though a toilsome one.Thus then through the wind-borne drift of the great force, throughwhich men could see the white waters tossing down below, amidst theclattering thunder of the Shivering Flood and the rumble of the windof the gap, that tore through their garments and hair as if it wouldrend all to rags and bear it away, the banners of the Wolf won theirway to the crest of the midmost height of the pass, and the long lineof the Host came clambering after them; and each band of warriors asit reached the top cast an unheard shout from amidst the tangled furyof wind and waters.A little further on and all that turmoil was behind them; the sun,now grown low, smote the wavering column of spray from the force attheir backs, till the rainbows lay bright across it; and the sunshinelay wide over a little valley that sloped somewhat steeply to thewest right up from the edge of the river; and beyond these westernslopes could men see a low peak spreading down on all sides to theplain, till it was like to a bossed shield, and the name of it wasShield-broad.  Dark grey was the valley everywhere, save that by theside of the water was a space of bright green-sward hedged abouttoward the mountain by a wall of rocks tossed up into wild shapes ofspires and jagged points.  The river itself was spread out wide andshallow, and went rattling about great grey rocks scattered here andthere amidst it, till it gathered itself together to tumble headlongover three slant steps into the mighty gap below.From the height in the pass those grey slopes seemed easy totraverse; but the warriors of the Wolf knew that it was farotherwise, for they were but the molten rock-sea that in time longpast had flowed forth from Shield-broad and filled up the wholevalley endlong and overthwart, cooling as it flowed, and the tumbledhedge of rock round about the green plain by the river was where thesaid rock-sea had been stayed by meeting with soft ground, and hadheaped itself up round about the green-sward.  And that great rock-flood as it cooled split in divers fashions; and the rain and weatherhad been busy on it for ages, so that it was worn into a maze ofnarrow paths, most of which, after a little, brought the wayfarer toa dead stop, or else led him back again to the place whence he hadstarted; so that only those who knew the passes throughly couldthread that maze without immeasurable labour.Now when the men of the Host looked from the high place whereon theystood toward the green plain by the river, they saw on the top ofthat rock-wall a red pennon waving on a spear, and beside it three orfour weaponed men gleaming bright in the evening sun; and they wavedtheir swords to the Host, and made lightning of the sunbeams, and themen of the Host waved swords to them in turn.  For these were theoutguards of the Host; and the place whereon they were was at whilesdwelt in by those who would drive the spoil in Silver-dale, andmidmost of the green-sward was a booth builded of rough stones andturf, a refuge for a score of men in rough weather.So the men of the vanward gat them down the hill, and made the bestof their way toward the grassy plain through that rocky maze whichhad once been as a lake of molten glass; and as short as the waylooked from above, it was two hours or ever they came out of it on tothe smooth turf, and it was moonlight and night ere the House of theFace had gotten on to the green-sward.There then the Host abode for that night, and after they had eatenlay down on the green grass and slept as they might.  Bow-may wouldhave brought the Sun-beam into the booth with some others of thewomen, but she would not enter it, because she deemed that otherwisethe Bride would abide without; and the Bride, when she came up, alongwith the House of the Steer, beheld the Sun-beam, that Wood-father'schildren had made a lair for her without like a hare's form; andforsooth many a time had she lain under the naked heaven in ShadowyVale and the waste about it, even as the Bride had in the meadows ofBurgdale.  So when the Bride was bidden thereto, she went meekly intothe booth, and lay there with others of the damsels-at-arms.CHAPTER XLII.  THE HOST COMETH TO THE EDGES OF SILVER-DALESo wore the night, and when the dawn was come were the two captainsafoot, and they went from band to band to see that all was ready, andall men were astir betimes, and by the time that the sun smote theeastern side of Shield-broad ruddy, they had broken their fast andwere dight for departure.  Then the horns blew up beside the banners,and rejoiced the hearts of men.  But by the command of the captainsthis was the last time that they should sound till they blew foronset in Silver-dale, because now would they be drawing nigher andnigher to the foemen, and they wotted not but that wandering bands ofthem might be hard on the lips of the pass, and might hear the horns'voice, and turn to see what was toward.Forth then went the banners of the Wolf, and the men of the vanwardfell to threading the rock-maze toward the north, and in two hours'time were clear of the Dale under Shield-broad.  All went in the sameorder as yesterday; but on this day the Sun-beam would bear herhauberk, and had a sword girt to her side, and her heart was high andher speech merry.When they left the Dale under Shield-broad the way was easy and widefor a good way, the river flowing betwixt low banks, and the passbeing more like a string of little valleys than a mere gap, as it hadbeen on the other side of the Dale.  But when one third of the daywas past, the way began to narrow on them again, and to rise uplittle by little; and at last the rock-walls drew close to the river,and when men looked toward the north they saw no way, and nought buta wall.  For the gap of the Shivering Flood turned now to the east,and the Flood came down from the east in many falls, as it were overa fearful stair, through a gap where there was no path between thecliffs and the water, nought but the boiling flood and its turmoil;so that they who knew not the road wondered what they should do.But Folk-might led the banners to where a great buttress of thecliffs thrust itself into the way, coming well-nigh down to thewater, just at the corner where the river turned eastward, and theygot them about it as they might, and on the other side thereof lo!another gap exceeding strait, scarce twenty foot over, wall-sided,rugged beyond measure, going up steeply from the great valley:  alittle water ran through it, mostly filling up the floor of it fromside to side; but it was but shallow.  This was now the battle-roadof the Host, and the vanward entered it at once, turning their backsupon the Shivering Flood.Full toilsome and dreary was that strait way; often great stones hungabove their heads, bridging the gap and hiding the sky from them; norwas there any path for them save the stream itself; so that whileswere they wading its waters to the knee or higher, and whiles werethey striding from stone to stone amidst the rattle of the waters,and whiles were they stepping warily along the ledges of rock abovethe deeper pools, and in all wise labouring in overcoming the ruggedroad amidst the twilight of the gap.Thus they toiled till the afternoon was well worn, and so at lastthey came to where the rock-wall was somewhat broken down on thenorth side, and great rocks had fallen across the gap, and dammed upthe waters, which fell scantily over the dam from stone to stone intoa pool at the bottom of it.  Up this breach, then, below the forcethey scrambled and struggled, for rough indeed was the road for them;and so came they up out of the gap on to the open hill-side, a greatshoulder of the heath sloping down from the north, and littered overwith big stones, borne thither belike by some ice-river of theearlier days; and one great rock was in special as great as the hallof a wealthy goodman, and shapen like to a hall with hipped gables,which same the men of the Wolf called House-stone.There then the noise and clatter of the vanward rose up on the faceof the heath, and men were exceeding joyous that they had come so farwithout mishap.  Therewith came weaponed men out from under House-stone, and they came toward the men of the vanward, and they were ahalf-score of the forerunners of the Wolf; therefore Folk-might andFace-of-god fell at once into speech with them, and had theirtidings; and when they had heard them, they saw nought to hinder thehost from going on their road to Silver-dale forthright; and therewere still three hours of daylight before them.  So the vanward ofthe host tarried not, and the captains left word with the men fromunder House-stone that the rest of the Host should fare on after themspeedily, and that they should give this word to each company, as mencame up from out the gap.  Then they fared speedily up the hillside,and in an hour's wearing had come to the crest thereof, and to wherethe ground fell steadily toward the north, and hereabout thescattered stones ceased, and on the other side of the crest the heathbegan to be soft and boggy, and at last so soft, that if they had notbeen wisely led, they had been bemired oftentimes.  At last they cameto where the flows that trickled through the mires drew together intoa stream, so that men could see it running; and thereon some of theWoodlanders cried out joyously that the waters were running north;and then all knew that they were drawing nigh to Silver-dale.No man they met on the road, nor did they of Shadowy Vale look tomeet any; because the Dusky Men were not great hunters for the morepart, except it were of men, and especially of women; and, moreover,these hill-slopes of the mountain-necks led no-whither and wereutterly waste and dreary, and there was nought to be seen there butsnipes and bitterns and whimbrel and plover, and here and there ahill-fox, or the great erne hanging over the heath on his way to themountain.When sunset came, they were getting clear of the miry ground, and thestream which they had come across amidst of the mires had got clearerand greater, and rattled down between wide stony sides over theheath; and here and there it deepened as it cleft its way throughlittle knolls that rose out of the face of the mountain-neck.  As theHost climbed one of these and was come to its topmost (it was lowenough not to turn the stream), Face-of-god looked and beheld dark-blue mountains rising up far off before him, and higher than these,but away to the east, the snowy peaks of the World-mountains.  Thenhe called to mind what he had seen from the Burg of the Runaways, andhe took Folk-might by the arm, and pointed toward those far-offmountains.'Yea,' said Folk-might, 'so it is, War-leader.  Silver-dale liethbetween us and yonder blue ridges, and it is far nigher to us than tothem.'But the Sun-beam came close to those twain, and took Face-of-god bythe hand and said:  'O Gold-mane, dost thou see?' and he turned aboutand beheld her, and saw how her cheeks flamed and her eyes glittered,and he said in a low voice:  'To-morrow for mirth or silence, forlife or death.'But the whole vanward as they came up stayed to behold the sight ofthe mountains on the other side of Silver-dale, and the banners ofthe Folk hung over their heads, moving but little in the soft air ofthe evening:  so went they on their ways.The sun sank, and dusk came on them as they followed down the stream,and night came, and was clear and starlit, though the moon was notyet risen.  Now was the ground firm and the grass sweet and flowery,and wind-worn bushes were scattered round about them, as they beganto go down into the ghyll that cleft the wall of Silver-dale, and thenight-wind blew in their faces from the very Dale and place of theBattle to be.  The path down was steep at first, but the ghyll waswide, and the sides of it no longer straight walls, as in the gaps oftheir earlier journey, but broken, sloping back, and (as they mightsee on the morrow) partly of big stones and shaly grit, partly grownover with bushes and rough grass, with here and there a little streamtrickling down their sides.  As they went, the ghyll widened out,till at last they were in a valley going down to the plain, in placessteep, in places flat and smooth, the stream ever rattling down themidst of it, and they on the west side thereof.  The vale was wellgrassed, and oak-trees and ash and holly and hazel grew here andthere about it; and at last the Host had before it a wood whichfilled the vale from side to side, not much tangled with undergrowth,and quite clear of it nigh to the stream-side.  Thereinto the vanwardentered, but went no long way ere the leaders called a halt and badepitch the banners, for that there should they abide the daylight.Thus it had been determined at the Council of the Hall of the Wolf;for Folk-might had said:  'With an Host as great as ours, and mostlyof men come into a land of which they know nought at all, anonslaught by night is perilous:  yea, and our foes should be over-much scattered, and we should have to wander about seeking them.  Letus rather abide in the wood of Wood-dale till the morning, and thendisplay our banners on the hill-side above Silver-dale, so that theymay gather together to fall upon us:  in no case shall they keep usout of the Dale.'There then they stayed, and as each company came up to the wood, theywere marshalled into their due places, so that they might set thebattle in array on the edge of Silver-dale,CHAPTER XLIII.  FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON SILVER-DALE:  THE BOWMEN'SBATTLEThere then they rested, as folk wearied with the toilsome journey,when they had set sure watches round about their campment; and theyate quietly what meat they had with them, and so gat them to sleep inthe wood on the eve of battle.But not all slept; for the two captains went about amongst thecompanies, Folk-might to the east, Face-of-god to the west, to lookto the watches, and to see that all was ordered duly.  Also the Sun-beam slept not, but she lay beside Bow-may at the foot of an oak-tree; she watched Face-of-god as he went away amidst the men of theHost, and watched and waked abiding his returning footsteps.The night was well worn by then he came back to his place in thevanward, and on his way back he passed through the folk of the Steerlaid along on the grass, all save those of the watch, and the lightof the moon high aloft was mingled with the light of the earliestdawn; and as it happed he looked down, and lo! close to his feet theface of the Bride as she lay beside her grand-sire, her head pillowedon a bundle of bracken.  She was sleeping soundly like a child whohas been playing all day, and whose sleep has come to him unsoughtand happily.  Her hands were laid together by her side; her cheek wasas fair and clear as it was wont to be at her best; her face lookedcalm and happy, and a lock of her dark-red hair strayed from heruncovered head over her breast and lay across her wrists, sopeacefully she slept.Face-of-god turned his eyes from her at once, and went by swiftly,and came to his own company.  The Sun-beam saw him coming, and rosestraightway to her feet from beside Bow-may, who lay fast asleep, andshe held out her hands to him; and he took them and kissed them, andhe cast his arms about her and kissed her mouth and her face, and shehis in likewise; and she said:'O Gold-mane, if this were but the morrow of to-morrow!  Yet shallall be well; shall it not?'Her voice was low, but it waked Bow-may, who sat up at once broadawake, after the manner of a hunter of the waste ever ready for thenext thing to betide, and moreover the Sun-beam had been in herthoughts these two days, and she feared for her, lest she should beslain or maimed.  Now she smiled on the Sun-beam and said:'What is it?  Does thy mind forebode evil?  That needeth not.  I tellthee it is not so ill for us of the sword to be in Silver-dale.Thrice have I been there since the Overthrow, and never more than ahalf-score in company, and yet am I whole to-day.''Yea, sister,' said Face-of-god, 'but in past times ye did your deedand then fled away; but now we come to abide here, and this night isthe last of lurking.''Ah,' she said, 'a little way from this I saw such things that we hadgood will to abide here longer, few as we were, but that we feared tobe taken alive.''What things were these?' said Face-of-god.'Nay,' she said, 'I will not tell thee now; but mayhap in the lightedwinter feast-hall, when the kindred are so nigh us and about us thatthey seem to us as if they were all the world, I may tell it thee; ormayhap I never shall.'Said the Sun-beam, smiling:  'Thou wilt ever be talking, Bow-may.Now let the War-leader depart, for he will have much to do.'And she was well at ease that she had seen Face-of-god again; but hesaid:'Nay, not so much; all is well-nigh done; in an hour it will be broadday, and two hours thereafter shall the Banner be displayed on theedge of Silver-dale.'The cheek of the Sun-beam flushed, and paled again, as she said:'Yea, we shall stand even as our Fathers stood on the day when,coming from off the waste, they beheld it, and knew it would betheirs.  Ah me! how have I longed for this morn.  But now--Tell me,Gold-mane, dost thou deem that I am afraid?  And I whom thou hastdeemed to be a God.'Quoth Bow-may:  'Thou shalt deem her twice a God ere noon-tide,brother Gold-mane.  But come now! the hour of deadly battle is athand, and we may not laugh that away; and therefore I bid theeremember, Gold-mane, how thou didst promise to kiss me once more onthe verge of deadly battle.'Therewith she stood up before him, and he tarried not, but kind andsmiling took her face between his two hands and kissed her lips, andshe cast her arms about him and kissed him, and then sank down on thegrass again, and turned from him, and laid her face amongst the grassand the bracken, and they could see that she was weeping, and herbody was shaken with sobs.  But the Sun-beam knelt down to her, andcaressed her with her hand, and spake kind words to her softly, whileFace-of-god went his ways to meet Folk-might.Now was the dawn fading into full daylight; and between dawn andsunrise were all men stirring; for the watch had waked the hundred-leaders, and they the leaders of scores and half-scores, and they thewhole folk; and they sat quietly in the wood and made no noise.In the night the watch of the Sickle had fallen in with a thrall whohad stolen up from the Dale to set gins for hares, and now in theearly morning they brought him to the War-leader.  He was even such aman as those with whom Face-of-god had fallen in before, neitherbetter nor worse than most of them:  he was sore afraid at first, butby then he was come to the captains he understood that he hadhappened upon friends; but he was dull of comprehension and slow ofspeech.  Albeit Folk-might gathered from him that the Dusky Men hadsome inkling of the onslaught; for he said that they had beengathering together in the marketplace of Silver-stead, and would doso again soon.  Moreover, the captains deemed from his speech thatthose new tribes had come to hand sooner than was looked for, andwere even now in the Dale.  Folk-might smiled as one who is not bestpleased when he heard these tidings; but Face-of-god was glad to hearthereof; for what he loathed most was that the war should drag out inhunting of scattered bands of the foe.  Herewith came Dallach to themas they talked (for Face-of-god had sent for him), and he fell toquestioning the man further; by whose answers it seemed that many menalso had come into the Dale from Rose-dale, so that they of thekindreds were like to have their hands full.  Lastly Dallach drewfrom the thrall that it was on that very morning that the great Folk-mote of the Dusky Men should be holden in the market-place of theStead, which was right great, and about it were the biggest of thehouses wherein the men of the kindred had once dwelt.So when they had made an end of questioning the thrall, and had givenhim meat and drink, they asked him if he would take weapons in hishand and lead them on the ways into the Dale, bidding him look aboutthe wood and note how great and mighty an host they were.  And thecarle yeasaid this, after staring about him a while, and they gavehim spear and shield, and he went with the vanward as a way-leader.Again presently came a watch of the Shepherds, and they had found aman and a woman dead and stark naked hanging to the boughs of a greatoak-tree deep in the wood.  This men knew for some vengeance of theDusky Men, for it was clear to see that these poor people had beensorely tormented before they were slain.  Also the same watch hadstumbled on the dead body of an old woman, clad in rags, lyingamongst the rank grass about a little flow; she was exceeding leanand hunger-starved, and in her hand was a frog which she had halfeaten.  And Dallach, when he heard of this, said that it was the wontof the Dusky Men to slay their thralls when they were past work, orto drive them into the wilderness to die.Lastly came a watch from the men of the Face, having with them twomore thralls, lusty young men; these they had come upon in company oftheir master, who had brought them up into the wood to shoot him abuck, and therefore they bare bows and arrows.  The watch had slainthe master straightway while the thralls stood looking on.  They weremuch afraid of the weaponed men, but answered to the questioning muchreadier than the first man; for they were household thralls, andbetter fed and clad than he, who was but a toiler in the fields.They yeasaid all his tale, and said moreover that the Folk-mote ofthe Dusky Men should be holden in the market-place that forenoon, andthat most of the warriors should be there, both the new-comers andthe Rose-dale lords, and that without doubt they should be underarms.To these men also they gave a good sword and a helm each, and badethem be brisk with their bows, and they said yea to marching with theHost; and indeed they feared nothing so much as being left behind;for if they fell into the hands of the Dusky Men, and their mastermissing, they should first be questioned with torments, and thenslain in the evillest manner.Now whereas things had thus betid, and that they knew thus much oftheir foemen, Face-of-god called all the chieftains together, andthey sat on the green grass and held counsel amongst them, and to oneand all it seemed good that they should suffer the Dusky Men togather together before they meddled with them, and then fall uponthem in such order and such time as should seem good to the captainswatching how things went; and this would be easy, whereas they wereall lying in the wood in the same order as they would stand inbattle-array if they were all drawn up together on the brow of thehill.  Albeit Face-of-god deemed it good, after he had heard all thatthey who had been in the Stead could tell him thereof, that theShepherd-Folk, who were more than three long hundreds, and they ofthe Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, four hundreds in all, shouldtake their places eastward of the Woodlanders who had led thevanward.Straightway the word was borne to these men, and the shift was made:so that presently the Woodlanders were amidmost of the Host, and hadwith them on their right hands the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, andthe Bull, and beyond them the Shepherd-Folk.  But on their left handlay the Men of the Vine, then they of the Sickle, and lastly the Menof the Face, and these three kindreds were over five hundreds ofwarriors:  as for the Men of the Wolf, they abode at first with thosecompanies which they had led through the wastes, though this waschanged afterwards.All this being done, Face-of-god gave out that all men should breaktheir fast in peace and leisure; and while men were at their meat,Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:  'Come, brother, for Iwould show thee a goodly thing; and thou, Dallach, come with us.'Then he brought them by paths in the wood till Face-of-god saw thesky shine white between the tree-boles, and in a little while theywere come well-nigh out of the thicket, and then they went warily;for before them was nought but the slopes of Wood-dale, going downsteeply into Silver-dale, with nought to hinder the sight of it, savehere and there bushes or scattered trees; and so fair and lovely itwas that Face-of-god could scarce forbear to cry out.  He saw that itwas only at the upper or eastern end, where the mountains of theWaste went round about it, that the Dale was narrow; it soon widenedout toward the west, and for the most part was encompassed by no suchstraight-sided a wall as was Burgdale, but by sloping hills andbents, mostly indeed somewhat higher and steeper than the passwherein they were, but such as men could well climb if they had amind to, and there were any end to their journey.  The Dale went duewest a good way, and then winded about to the southwest, and so washidden from them thereaway by the bents that lay on their left hand.As it was wider, so it was not so plain a ground as was Burgdale, butrose in knolls and little hills here and there.  A river greater thanthe Weltering Water wound about amongst the said mounds; and alongthe side of it out in the open dale were many goodly houses andhomesteads of stone.  The knolls were mostly covered over with vines,and there were goodly and great trees in groves and clumps, chieflyoak and sweet chestnut and linden; many were the orchards, now inblossom, about the homesteads; the pastures of the neat and horsesspread out bright green up from the water-side, and deeper greenshowed the acres of the wheat on the lower slopes of the knolls, andin wide fields away from the river.Just below the pitch of the hill whereon they were, lay Silver-stead,the town of the Dale.  Hitherto it had been an unfenced place; butFolk-might pointed to where on the western side a new white wall wasrising, and on which, young as the day yet was, men were busy layingthe stones and spreading the mortar.  Fair seemed that town to Face-of-god:  the houses were all builded of stone, and some of thebiggest were roofed with lead, which also as well as silver was dugout of the mountains at the eastern end of the Dale.  The market-place was clear to see from where they stood, though there werehouses on all sides of it, so wide it was.  From their standing-placeit was but three furlongs to this heart of Silver-dale; and Face-of-god could see brightly-clad men moving about in it already.  Highabove their heads he beheld two great clots of scarlet and yellowraised on poles and pitched in front of a great stone-built hallroofed with lead, which stood amidmost of the west end of the Place,and betwixt those poles he saw on a mound with long slopes at itssides somewhat of white stone, and amidmost of the whole Place agreat stack of faggot-wood built up four-square.  Those red andyellow things on the poles he deemed would be the banners of themurder-carles; and Folk-might told him that even so it was, and thatthey were but big bunches of strips of woollen cloth, much like togreat ragmops, save that the rags were larger and longer:  no othertoken of war, said Folk-might, did those folk carry, save acrookbladed sword, smeared with man's blood, and bigger than any manmight wield in battle.'Art thou far-seeing, War-leader?' quoth he.  'What canst thou see inthe market-place?'Said Face-of-god:  'Far-seeing am I above most men, and I see in thePlace a man in scarlet standing by the banner, which is pitched infront of the great stone hall, near to the mound with the white stoneon it; and meseemeth he beareth a great horn in his hand.'Said Folk-might:  'Yea, and that stone hall was our Mote-house whenwe were lords of the Dale, and thence it was that they who are nowthralls of the Dusky Men sent to them their message and token ofyielding.  And as for that white stone, it is the altar of their god;for they have but one, and he is that same crook-bladed sword.  Andnow that I look, I see a great stack of wood amidmost the market-place, and well I know what that betokeneth.''Lo you!' said Face-of-god, 'the man with the horn is gone up on tothe altar-mound, and meseemeth he is setting the little end of thehorn to his mouth.''Hearken then!' said Folk-might.  And in a moment came the hoarsetuneless sound of the horn down the wind towards them; and Folk-mightsaid:'I deem I should know what that blast meaneth; and now is it timethat the Host drew nigher to set them in array behind these verytrees.  But if ye will, War-leader, we will abide here and watch theways of the foemen, and send Dallach with the word to the Host; alsoI would have thee suffer me to bid hither at once two score and tenof the best of the bowmen of our folk and the Woodlanders, and Wood-wise to lead them, for he knoweth well the land hereabout, and whatis good to do.''It is good,' said Face-of-god.  'Be speedy, Dallach!'So Dallach departed, running lightly, and the two chiefs abode there;and the horn in Silver-stead blew at whiles for a little, and thenstayed; and Folk-might said:'Lo you! they come flockmeal to the Mote-stead; the Place will befilled ere long.'Said Face-of-god:  'Will they make offerings to their god at thehallowing in of their Folk-mote?  Where then are the slaughter-beasts?''They shall not long be lacking,' said Folk-might.  'See you it isgetting thronged about the altar and the Mote-house.'Now there were four ways into the Market-place of Silver-stead turnedtoward the four airts, and the midmost of the kindreds' battle lookedright down the southern one, which went up to the wood, but stoppedthere in a mere woodland path, and the more part of the town laynorth and west of this way, albeit there was a way from the eastalso.  But the hill-side just below the two captains lay two furlongswest of this southern way; and it went down softly till it was gottenquite near to the backs of the houses on the south side of theMarket-place, and was sprinkled scantly with bushes and trees asaforesaid; but at last were there more bushes, which well-nigh made ahedge across it, reaching from the side of the southern way; and afoot or two beyond these bushes the ground fell by a steep and brokenbent down to the level of the Market-place, and betwixt that fringeof bushes and the backs of the houses on the south side of the Placewas less it maybe than a full furlong:  but the southern roadaforesaid went down softly into the Market-place, since it had beenfashioned so by men.Now the two chiefs heard a loud blast of horns come up from the town,and lo! a great crowd of men wending their ways down the road fromthe north, and they came into the market-place with spears and otherweapons tossing in the air, and amidst of these men, who seemed to beall of the warriors, they saw as they drew nigher some two score andten of men clad in long raiment of yellow and scarlet, with tallspiring hats of strange fashion on their heads, and in their handslong staves with great blades like scythes done on to them; andagain, in the midst of these yellow and red glaive-bearers, in thevery heart of the throng were some score of naked folk, they deemedboth men and women, but were not sure, so close was the throng; norcould they see if they were utterly naked.'Lo you, brother!' quoth Folk-might, 'said I not that the beasts forthe hewing should not tarry?  Yonder naked folk are even they:  andye may well deem that they are the thralls of the Dusky Men; andmeseemeth by the whiteness of their skins they be of the best ofthem.  For these felons, it is like, look to winning great plenty ofthralls in Burgdale, and so set the less store on them they have, andmay expend them freely.'As he spake they heard the sound of men marching in the wood behindthem, and they turned about and saw that there was come Wood-wise,and with him upwards of two score and ten of the bowmen of theWoodlanders and the Wolf--huntsmen, cragsmen, and scourers of theWaste; men who could shoot the chaffinch on the twig a hundred yardsaloof; who could make a hiding-place of the bennets of the waysidegrass, or the stem of the slender birch-tree.  With these must needsbe Bow-may, who was the closest shooter of all the kindreds.So then Wood-wise told the War-leader that Dallach had given the wordto the Host, and that all men were astir and would be there presentlyin their ordered companies; and Face-of-god spake to Folk-might, andsaid:  'Chief of the Wolf, wilt thou not give command to thesebowmen, and set them to the work; for thou wottest thereof.''Yea, that will I,' said Folk-might, and turned to Wood-wise, andsaid:  'Wood-wise, get ye down the slope, and loose on these felons,who have a murder on hand, if so be ye have a chance to do it wisely.But in any case come ye all back; for all shall be needed yet to-day.So flee if they pursue, for ye shall have us to flee to.  Now be yewary, nor let the curse of the Wolf and the Face lie on yourslothfulness.'Wood-wise did but nod his head and lift his hand to his fellows, whoset off after him down the slope without more tarrying.  They wentvery warily, as if they were hunting a quarry which would flee fromthem; and they crept amongst the grass and stones from bush to bushlike serpents, and so, unseen by the Dusky Men, who indeed werebusied over their own matters, they came to the fringe of bushesabove the broken ground aforesaid, and there they took their stand,and before them below those steep banks was but the space at the backof the houses.  As to the houses, as aforesaid, they were not so highas elsewhere about the Market-place; and at the end of a long lowhall there was a gap between its gable and the next house, wherebythey had a clear sight of the Place about the god's altar and thebanners, and the great hall of Silver-dale, with the double stairthat went up to the door thereof.There then they made them ready, and Wood-wise set men to watch thatnone should come sidelong on them unawares; their bows were bent andtheir quivers open, and they were eager for the fray.Thus they beheld the Market-place from their cover, and saw thatthose folk who were to be hewn to the god were now standing facingthe altar in a half-ring, and behind them in another half-ring theglaive-bearers who had brought them thither stood glaive in handready to hew them down when the token should be given; and these wereindeed the priests of the god.There was clear space round about these poor slaughter-thralls, sothat the bowmen could see them well, and they told up a score ofthem, half men, half women, and they were all stark naked save forwreaths of flowers about their middles and their necks; and they hadshackles of lead about their wrists; which same lead should be takenout of the fire wherein they should be burned, and from the shape itshould take after it had passed through the fire would the priestsforetell the luck of the deed to be done.It was clear to be seen from thence that Folk-might was right when hesaid that these slaughter-thralls were of the best of the house-thralls and bed-mates of the Dusky Men, and that these felons wereopen-handed to their god, and would not cheat him, or withhold fromhim the best and most delicate of all they had.Now spake Wood-wise to those about him:  'It is sure that Folk-mightwould have us give these poor thralls a chance, and that we mustloose upon the felons who would hew them down; and if we are to comeback again, we can go no nigher.  What sayest thou, Bow-may?  Is itnigh enough?  Can aught be done?''Yea, yea,' she said, 'nigh enough it is; but let Gold-ring be withme and half a score of the very best, whether they be of our folk orthe Woodlanders, men who cannot miss such a mark; and when we haveloosed, then let all loose, and stay not till our shot be spent.Haste, now haste! time presseth; for if the Host showeth on the browof the hill, these felons will hew down their slaughter-beasts beforethey turn on their foemen.  Let the grey-goose wing speed trouble andconfusion amongst them.'But ere she had done her words Wood-wise had got to speaking quietlywith the Woodlanders; and Bears-bane, who was amidst them, chose outeight of the best of his folk, men who doubted nothing of hittingwhatever they could see in the Market-place; and they took theirstand for shooting, and with them besides Bow-may were two women andfour men of the Wolf, and Gold-ring withal, a carle of fifty winters,long, lean, and wiry, a fell shooter if ever anyone were.So all these notched their shafts and laid them on the yew, and eachhad between the two last fingers of the shaft-hand another shaftready, and a half score more stuck into the ground before him.Now giveth Wood-wise the word to these sixteen as to which of thefelons with the glaives they shall each one aim at; and he saithwithal in a soft voice:  'Help cometh from the Hill; soon shallbattle be joined in Silver-dale.'Thus stand they watching Bow-may and Gold-ring till they draw homethe notches; and amidst their waiting the glaive-bearing felons falla-singing a harsh and ugly hymn to their crooked-sword god, and theMarket-stead is thronged endlong and overthwart with the tribes ofthe Dusky Men.There now standeth Bow-may far-sighted and keen-eyed, her face aspale as a linen sleeve, an awful smile on her glittering eyes andclose-set lips, and she feeling the twisted string of the red yew andthe polished sides of the notch, while the yelling song of the Duskypriests quavers now and ends with a wild shrill cry, and she noteththe midmost of the priests beginning to handle his weapon:  thenswift and steady she draweth home the notches, while the yew bowstandeth still as the oak-bole ere the summer storm ariseth, and thetwang of the sixteen strings maketh but one fell sound as thefeathered bane of men goeth on its way.There was silence for a moment of time in the Market of Silver-stead,as if the bolt of the Gods had fallen there; and then arose a hugewordless yell from those about the altar, and one of the priests whowas left hove up his glaive two-handed to smite the naked slaughter-thralls; but or ever the stroke fell, Bow-may's second shaft wasthrough his throat, and he rolled over amidst his dead fellows; andthe other fifteen had loosed with her, and then even as they couldWood-wise and the others of their company; and all they notched andloosed without tarrying, and no shout, no word came from their lips,only the twanging strings spake for them; for they deemed the minutesthat hurried by were worth much joy of their lives to be.  And fewindeed were the passing minutes ere the dead men lay in heaps aboutthe Altar of the Crooked Sword, and the wounded men wallowed amidstthem.CHAPTER XLIV.  OF THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE MEN OF THE STEER, THE BRIDGE,AND THE BULLWild was the turmoil and confusion in the Market-stead; for the morepart of the men therein knew not what had befallen about the altar,though some clomb up to the top of that stack of faggots built forthe burning of the thralls, and when they saw what was toward fell toyelling and cursing; and their fellows on the plain Place could nothear their story for the clamour, and they also fell to howling as ifa wood full of wild dogs was there.And still the shafts rained down on that throng from the Bent of theBowmen, for another two score men of the Woodlanders had crept downthe hill to them, and shafts failed them not.  But the Dusky Menabout the altar, for all their terror, or even maybe because of it,now began to turn upon the scarce-seen foemen, and to press up wildlytoward the hill-side, though as it were without any order or aim.Every man of them had his weapons, and those no mere gilded toys, buttheir very tools of battle; and some, but no great number, had theirbows with them and a few shafts; and these began to shoot atwhatsoever they could see on the hill-side, but at first so wildlyand hurriedly that they did no harm.It must be said of them that at first only those about the altar fellon toward the hill; for those about the road that led southward knewnot what had betided nor whither to turn.  So that at this beginningof the battle, of all the thousands in the great Place it was but afew hundreds that set on the Bent of the Bowmen, and at these thebowmen of the kindreds shot so close and so wholly together that theyfell one over another in the narrow ways between the houses wherebythey must needs go to gather on the plain ground betwixt the backs ofthe houses and the break of the hill-side.  But little by little thearchers of the Dusky Men gathered behind the corpses of the slain,and fell to shooting at what they could see of the men of thekindreds, which at that while was not much, for as bold as they were,they fought like wary hunters of the Wood and the Waste.But now at last throughout all that throng of Felons in the Market-place the tale began to spread of foemen come into the Dale andshooting from the Bents, and all they turned their faces to the hill,and the whole set of the throng was thitherward; though they faredbut slowly, so evil was the order of them, each man hindering hisneighbour as he went.  And not only did the Dusky Men come flockmealtoward the Bent of the Bowmen, but also they jostled along toward theroad that led southward.  That beheld Wood-wise from the Bent, and hewas minded to get him and his aback, now that they had made so greata slaughter of the foemen; and two or three of his fellows had beenhurt by arrows, and Bow-may, she would have been slain thrice overbut for the hammer-work of the Alderman.  And no marvel was that; fornow she stood on a little mound not half covered by a thin thorn-bush, and notched and loosed at whatever was most notable, as thoughshe were shooting at the mark on a summer evening in Shadowy Vale.But as Wood-wise was at point to give the word to depart, from behindthem rang out the merry sound of the Burgdale horns, and he turned tolook at the wood-side, and lo! thereunder was the hill bright anddark with men-at-arms, and over them floated the Banners of the Wolf,and the Banners of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull.  Then gaveforth the bowmen of the kindreds their first shout, and they made nostay in their shooting; but shot the eagerer, for they deemed thathelp would come without their turning about to draw it to them:  andeven so it was.  For straightway down the bent came striding Face-of-god betwixt the two Banners of the Wolf, and beside him were Red-wolfthe tall and War-grove, and therewithal Wood-wont and Wood-wicked,and many other men of the Wolf; for now that the men of the kindredshad been brought face to face with the foe, and there was less needof them for way-leaders, the more part of them were liefer to fightunder their own banner along with the Woodlanders; so that thecompany of those who went under the Wolves was more than three longhundreds and a half; and the bowmen on the edge of the bent shoutedagain and merrily, when they felt that their brothers were amongstthem, and presently was the arrow-storm at its fiercest, and thetwanging of bow-strings and the whistle of the shafts was as the windamong the clefts of the mountains; for all the new-comers were bowmenof the best.But the kindreds of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, they hungyet a while longer on the hills' brow, their banners floating overthem and their horns blowing; and the Dusky Felons in the Market-place beheld them, and fear and rage at once filled their hearts, anda fierce and dreadful yell brake out from them, and joyously did theMen of Burgdale answer them, and song arose amongst them even such asthis:The Men of the Bridge sing:Why stand ye together, why bear ye the shield,Now the calf straineth tether at edge of the field?Now the lamb bleateth stronger and waters run clear,And the day groweth longer and glad is the year?Now the mead-flowers jostle so thick as they stand,And singeth the throstle all over the land?The Men of the Steer sing:No cloud the day darkened, no thunder we heard,But the horns' speech we hearkened as men unafeared.Yea, so merry it sounded, we turned from the Dale,Where all wealth abounded, to wot of its tale.The Men of the Bridge sing:What white boles then bear ye, what wealth of the woods?What chafferers hear ye bid loud for your goods?The Men of the Bull sing:O the bright beams we carry are stems of the steel;Nor long shall we tarry across them to deal.Hark the men of the cheaping, how loudly they cryOn the hook for the reaping of men doomed to die!They all sing:Heave spear up! fare forward, O Men of the Dale!For the Warrior, our war-ward, shall hearken the tale.Therewith they ceased a moment, and then gave a great and heartyshout all together, and all their horns blew, and they moved on downthe hill as one man, slowly and with no jostling, the spear-menfirst, and then they of the axe and the sword; and on their flanksthe deft archers loosed on the stumbling jostling throng of the DuskyMen, who for their part came on drifting and surging up the road tothe hill.But when those big spearmen of the Dale had gone a little way thehorns' voice died out, and their great-staved spears rose up fromtheir shoulders into the air, and stood so a moment, and then slowlyfell forward, as the oars of the longship fall into the row-locks,and then over the shoulders of the foremost men showed the steel ofthe five ranks behind them, and their own spears cast long bars ofshadow on the whiteness of the sunny road.  No sound came from themnow save the rattle of their armour and the tramp of their steadyfeet; but from the Dusky Men rose up hideous confused yelling, andthose that could free themselves from the tangle of the throng rusheddesperately against the on-rolling hedge of steel, and the wholethrong shoved on behind them.  Then met steel and men; here and therean ash-stave broke; here and there a Dusky Felon rolled himselfunhurt under the ash-staves, and hewed the knees of the Dalesmen, anda tall man came tottering down; but what men or wood-wights couldendure the push of spears of those mighty husbandmen?  The Dusky Onesshrunk back yelling, or turned their backs and rushed at their ownfolk with such fierce agony that they entered into the throng, tillthe terror of the spear reached to the midmost of it and swayed themback on the hindermost; for neither was there outgate for the felonson the flanks of the spearmen, since there the feathered death besetthem, and the bowmen (and the Bride amongst the foremost) shot whollytogether, and no shaft flew idly.  But the wise leaders of theDalesmen would not that they should thrust in too far amongst thehowling throng of the Dusky Men, lest they should be hemmed in bythem; for they were but a handful in regard to them:  so there theystayed, barring the way to the Dusky Men, and the bowmen still loosedfrom the flanks of them, or aimed deftly from betwixt the ranks ofthe spearmen.And now was there a space of ten strides or more betwixt the Dalesmenand their foes, over which the spears hung terribly, nor durst theDusky Men adventure there; and thereon was nought but men dead orsorely hurt.  Then suddenly a horn rang thrice shrilly over all thenoise and clamour of the throng, and the ranks of the spearmenopened, and forth into that space strode two score of the swordsmenand axe-wielders of the Dale, their weapons raised in their hands,and he who led them was Iron-hand of the House of the Bull:  tall hewas, wide-shouldered, exceeding strong, but beardless and fair-faced.He bore aloft a two-edged sword, broad-bladed, exceeding heavy, sothat few men could wield it in battle, but not right long; it was anancient weapon, and his father before him had called it the Barley-scythe.  With him were some of the best of the kindreds, as Wolf ofWhitegarth, Long-hand of Oakholt, Hart of Highcliff, and War-well thecaptain of the Bridge.  These made no tarrying on that space of thedead, but cried aloud their cries:  'For the Burg and the Steer! forthe Dale and the Bridge! for the Dale and the Bull!' and so fell atonce on the Felons; who fled not, nor had room to flee; and also theyfeared not the edge-weapons so sorely as they feared those hugespears.  So they turned fiercely on the swordsmen, and chiefly onIron-hand, as he entered in amongst them the first of all, hewing tothe right hand and the left, and many a man fell before the Barley-scythe; for they were but little before him.  Yet as one fell anothertook his place, and hewed at him with the steel axe and the crookedsword; and with many strokes they clave his shield and brake his helmand rent his byrny, while he heeded little save smiting with theBarley-scythe, and the blood ran from his arm and his shoulder andhis thigh.But War-well had entered in among the foe on his left hand, andunshielded hove up a great broad-bladed axe, that clave the ironhelms of the Dusky Men, and rent their horn-scaled byrnies.  He wasnot very tall, but his shoulders were huge and his arms long, andnought could abide his stroke.  He cleared a ring round Iron-hand,whose eyes were growing dim as the blood flowed from him, and hewedthree strokes before him; then turned and drew the champion out ofthe throng, and gave him into the arms of his fellows to stanch theblood that drained away the might of his limbs; and then with a greatwordless roar leaped back again on the Dusky Men as the lion leapethon the herd of swine; and they shrank away before him; and all theswordsmen shouted, 'For the Bridge, for the Bridge!' and pressed onthe harder, smiting down all before them.  On his left hand now wasHart of Highcliff wielding a good sword hight Chip-driver, wherewithhe had slain and hurt a many, fighting wisely with sword and shield,and driving the point home through the joints of the armour.  Buteven therewith, as he drave a great stroke at a lord of the DuskyOnes, a cast-spear came flying and smote him on the breast, so thathe staggered, and the stroke fell flatlings on the shield-boss of hisfoe, and Chip-driver brake atwain nigh the hilts; but Hart closedwith him, and smote him on the face with the pommel, and tore his axefrom his hand and clave his skull therewith, and slew him with hisown weapon, and fought on valiantly beside War-well.Now War-well had fought so fiercely that he had rent his own hauberkwith the might of his strokes, and as he raised his arm to smite ahuge stroke, a deft man of the Felons thrust the spike of his war-axeup under his arm; and when War-well felt the smart of the steel, heturned on that man, and, letting his axe fall down to his wrist andhang there by its loop, he caught the foeman up by the neck and thebreech, and drave him against the other Dusky Ones before him, sothat their weapons pierced and rent their own friend and fellow.Then he put forth the might of his arms and the pith of his body, andhove up that felon and cast him on to the heads of his fellow murder-carles, so that he rent them and was rent by them.  Then War-wellfell on again with the axe, and all the champions of the Dale shoutedand fell on with him, and the foe shrank away; and the Dalesmencleared a space five fathoms' length before them, and the spearmendrew onward and stood on the space whereon the first onslaught hadbeen.Then drew those hewers of the Dale together, and forth from thecompany came the man that bare the Banner of the Bridget and thechampions gathered round him, and they ordered their ranks and strodewith the Banner before them three times to and fro across the roadathwart the front of the spearmen, and then with a great shout drewback within the spear-hedge.  Albeit five of the champions of theDale had been slain outright there, and the more part of them hurtmore or less.But when all were well within the ranks, once again blew the horn,and all the spears sank to the rest, and the kindreds drave thespear-furrow, and a space was swept clear before them, and the criesand yells of the Dusky Men were so fierce and wild that the roughvoices of the Dalesmen were drowned amidst them.Forth then came every bowman of the kindred that was there and loosedon the Dusky Men; and they forsooth had some bowmen amongst them, butcooped up and jostled as they were they shot but wildly; whereas eachshaft of the Dale went home truly.But amongst the bowmen forth came the Bride in her glittering war-gear, and stepped lightly to the front of the spearmen.  Her own yewbow had been smitten by a shaft and broken in her hand:  so she hadcaught up a short horn bow and a quiver from one of the slain of theDusky Men; and now she knelt on one knee under the shadow of thespears nigh to her grandsire Hall-ward, and with a pale face andknitted brow notched and loosed, and notched and loosed on the throngof foemen, as if she were some daintily fashioned engine of war.So fared the battle on the road that went from the south into theMarket-stead.  Valiantly had the kindred fought there, and no man ofthem had blenched, and much had they won; but the way was perilousbefore them, for the foe was many and many.CHAPTER XLV.  OF FACE-OF-GOD'S ONSLAUGHTNow the banners of the Wolf flapped and rippled over the heads of theWoodlanders and the Men of the Wolf; and the men shot all they might,nor took heed now to cover themselves against the shafts of the DuskyMen.  As for these, for all they were so many, their arrow-shot wasno great matter, for they were in very evil order, as has been said;and moreover, their rage was so great to come to handy strokes withthese foemen, that some of them flung away their bows to brandish theaxe or the sword.  Nevertheless were some among the kindred hurt orslain by their arrows.Now stood Face-of-god with the foremost; and from where he stood hecould see somewhat of the battle of the Dalesmen, and he wotted thatit was thriving; therefore he looked before him and close around him,and noted what was toward there.  The space betwixt the houses andthe break of the bent was crowded with the fury of the Dusky Mentossing their weapons aloft, crying to each other and at the kindred,and here and there loosing a bow-string on them; but whatever wastheir rage they might not come a many together past a line within tenfathom of the bent's end; for three hundred of the best of bowmenwere shooting at them so ceaselessly that no Dusky man was safe ofany bare place of his body, and they fell over one another in thatpenfold of slaughter, and for all their madness did but little.Yet was the heart of the War-leader troubled; for he wotted that itmight not last for ever, and there seemed no end to the throng ofmurder-carles; and the time would come when the arrowshot would bespent, and they must needs come to handy strokes, and that with somany.Now a voice spake to him as he gazed with knitted brows and carefulheart on that turmoil of battle:'What now hast thou done with the Sun-beam, and where is her brother?Is the Chief of the Wolf skulking when our work is so heavy?  Andthou meseemeth art overlate on the field:  the mowing of this meadowis no sluggard's work.'He turned and beheld Bow-may, and gazed on her face for a moment, andsaw her eyes how they glittered, and how the pommels of her cheekswere burning red and her lips dry and grey; but before he answered helooked all round about to see what was to note; and he touched Bow-may on the shoulder and pointed to down below where a man of theFelons had just come out of the court of one of the houses:  a mantaller than most, very gaily arrayed, with gilded scales all overhim, so that, with his dark face and blue eyes, he looked like somestrange dragon.  Bow-may spake not, but stamped her foot with anger.Yet if her heart were hot, her hand was steady; for she notched ashaft, and just as the Dusky Chief raised his axe and brandished italoft, she loosed, and the shaft flew and smote the felon in thearmpit and the default of the armour, and he fell to earth.  But evenas she loosed, Face-of-god cried out in a loud voice:'O lads of battle! shoot close and all together.  Tarry not, tarrynot! for we need a little time ere sword meets sword, and the othersof the kindreds are at work!'But Bow-may turned round to him and said:  'Wilt thou not answer me?Where is thy kindness gone?'Even as she was speaking she had notched and loosed another shaft,speaking as folk do who turn from busy work at loom or bench.Then said Face-of-god:  'Shoot on, sister Bow-may!  The Sun-beam isgone with her brother, and he is with the Men of the Face.'He broke off here, for a man fell beside him hurt in the neck, andFace-of-god took his bow from his hands and shot a shaft, while oneof the women who had been hurt also tended the newly-wounded man.Then Face-of-god went on speaking:'She was unwilling to go, but Folk-might and I constrained her; forwe knew that this is the most perilous place of the battle--hah! seethose three felons, Bow-may! they are aiming hither.'And again he loosed and Bow-may also, but a shaft rattled on his helmwithal and another smote a Woodlander beside him, and pierced throughthe calf of his leg, as he turned and stooped to take fresh arrowsfrom a sheaf that lay there; but the carle took it by the notch andthe point, and brake it and drew it out, and then stood up and wenton shooting.  And Face-of-god spake again:'Folk-might skulketh not; nor the Men of the Vine, and the Sickle,and the Face, nor the Shepherd-Folk:  soon shall they be making ourwork easy to us, if we can hold our own till then.  They are on theother roads that lead into the square.  Now suffer me, and shoot on!'Therewith he looked round about him, and he saw on the left hand thatall was quiet; and before him was the confused throng of the DuskyMen trampling their own dead and wounded, and not able as yet tocross that death-line of the arrow so near to them.  But on his righthand he saw how they of the kindreds held them firm on the way.  Thenfor a moment of time he considered and thought, till him-seemed hecould see the whole battle yet to be foughten; and his face flushed,and he said sharply:  'Bow-may, abide here and shoot, and show theothers where to shoot, while the arrows hold out; but we will gofurther for a while, and ye shall follow when we have made the rentgreat enough.'She turned to him and said:  'Why art thou not more joyous? thou artlike an host without music or banners.''Nay,' said he, 'heed not me, but my bidding!'She said hastily:  'I think I shall die here; since for all we haveshot we minish them nowise.  Now kiss me this once amidst the battle,and say farewell.'He said:  'Nay, nay; it shall not go thus.  Abide a little while, andthou shalt see all this tangle open, as the sun cleaveth the cloudson the autumn morning.  Yet lo thou! since thou wilt have it so.'And he bent forward and kissed her face, and now the tears ran overit, and she said smiling somewhat:  'Now is this more than I lookedfor, whatso may betide.'But while she was yet speaking he cried in a great voice:'Ye who have spent your shot, or have nigh spent it, to axe andsword, and follow me to clear the ground 'twixt the bent and thehalls.  Let each help each, but throng not each other.  Shoot wisely,ye bowmen, and keep our backs clear of the foe.  On, on! for the Burgand the Face, for the Burg and the Face!'Therewith he leapt down the steep of the hill, bounding like thehart, with Dale-warden naked in his hand; and they that followed weretwo score and ten; and the arrows of their bowmen rained over theirheads on the Dusky Men, as they smote down the first of the foemen,and the others shrieked and shrank from them, or turned on themsmiting wildly and desperately.But Face-of-god swept round the great sword and plunged into that seaof turmoil and noise and evil sights and savours, and even therewithhe heard clearly a voice that said:  'Goldring, I am hurt; take mybow a while!' and knew it for Bow-may's; but it came to his ears likethe song of a bird without meaning; for it was as if his life werechanged at once; and in a minute or two he had cut thrice with theedge and thrust twice with the point, eager, but clear-eyed and deft;and he saw as in a picture the foe before him, and the grey roofs ofSilver-stead, and through the gap in them the tops of the blue ridgesfar aloof.  And now had three fallen before him, and they feared him,and turned on him, and smote so many together that their strokescrossed each other, and one warded him from the other; and he laughedaloud and shielded himself, and drave the point of Dale-warden amidstthe tangle of weapons through the open mouth of a captain of theFelons, and slashed a cheek with a back-stroke, and swept round theedge to his right hand and smote off a blue-eyed snub-nosed head; andtherewith a pole-axe smote him on the left side of his helm, so thathe tottered; but he swung himself round, and stood stark and upright,and gave a short hack with the edge, keeping Dale-warden well inhand, and a gold-clad felon, a champion of them, and their tallest onthe ground, fell aback, his throat gaping more than the mouth of him.Then Face-of-god shouted and waved Dale-warden aloft to the Banner ofthe Wolf that floated behind and above him, and he cried out:  'As Ihave promised so have I done!'  And he looked about, and beheld howvaliantly his fellows had been doing; for before him now was a spaceof earth with no man standing on his feet thereon, like the swathe ofthe mowers of June; and beyond that was the crowd of the Dusky Menwavering like the tall grass abiding the scythe.But a minute, and they fell to casting at Face-of-god and his fellowsspears and knives and shields and whatsoever would fly; and a spearsmote him on the breast, but entered not; and a bossed shield fellover his face withal, and a plummet of sling-lead smote his helm, andhe fell to earth; but leapt up again straightway, and heard as hearose a great shout close to him, and a shrill cry, and lo! at hisleft side Bow-may, her sword in her hand, and the hand red with bloodfrom a shaft-graze on her wrist, and a white cloth stained with bloodabout her neck; and on his right side Wood-wise bearing the bannerand crying the Wolf-whoop; for the whole company was come down fromthe slope and stood around him.Then for a little while was there such a stilling of the tumult abouthim there, that he heard great and glad cries from the Road of theSouth of 'The Burg and the Steer!  The Dale and the Bridge!  The Daleand the Bull!'  And thereafter a terrible great shrieking cry, and ahuge voice that cried:  'Death, death, death to the Dusky Men!'  Andthereafter again fierce cries and great tumult of the battle.Then Face-of-god shook Dale-warden in the air, and strode forwardfiercely, but not speedily, and the whole company went foot for footalong with him; and as he went, would he or would he not, song cameinto his mouth, a song of the meadows of the Dale, even such as this:The wheat is done blooming and rust's on the sickle,   And green are the meadows grown after the scythe.Come, hands for the dance!  For the toil hath been mickle,   And 'twixt haysel and harvest 'tis time to be blithe.And what shall the tale be now dancing is over,   And kind on the meadow sits maiden by man,And the old man bethinks him of days of the lover,   And the warrior remembers the field that he wan?Shall we tell of the dear days wherein we are dwelling,   The best days of our Mother, the cherishing Dale,When all round about us the summer is telling,   To ears that may hearken, the heart of the tale?Shall we sing of these hands and these lips that caress us,   And the limbs that sun-dappled lie light here beside,When still in the morning they rise but to bless us,   And oft in the midnight our footsteps abide?O nay, but to tell of the fathers were better,   And of how we were fashioned from out of the earth;Of how the once lowly spurned strong at the fetter;   Of the days of the deeds and beginning of mirth.And then when the feast-tide is done in the morning,   Shall we whet the grey sickle that bideth the wheat,Till wan grow the edges, and gleam forth a warning   Of the field and the fallow where edges shall meet.And when cometh the harvest, and hook upon shoulder   We enter the red wheat from out of the road,We shall sing, as we wend, of the bold and the bolder,   And the Burg of their building, the beauteous abode.As smiteth the sickle amid the sun's burning   We shall sing how the sun saw the token unfurled,When forth fared the Folk, with no thought of returning,   In the days when the Banner went wide in the world.Many saw that he was singing, but heard not the words of his mouth,for great was the noise and clamour.  But he heard Bow-may, how shelaughed by his side, and cried out:'Gold-mane, dear-heart, now art thou merry indeed; and glad am I,though they told me that I am hurt.--Ah! now beware, beware!'For indeed the Dusky Men, seeing the wall of steel rolling down onthem, and cooped up by the houses, so that they scarce knew how toflee, turned in the face of death, the foremost of them, and rushedfuriously on the array of the Woodlanders, and all those behindpressed on them like the big wave of the ebbing sea when the gust ofthe wind driveth it landward.The Woodlanders met them, shouting out:  'The Greenwood and the Wolf,the Greenwood and the Wolf!'  But not a few of them fell there,though they gave not back a foot; for so fierce now were the DuskyMen, that hewing and thrusting at them availed nought, unless theywere slain outright or stunned; and even if they fell they rolledthemselves up against their tall foe-men, heeding not death or woundsif they might but slay or wound.  There then fell War-grove and tenothers of the Woodlanders, and four men of the Wolf, but none beforehe had slain his foeman; and as each man fell or was hurt grievously,another took his place.Now a felon leapt up and caught Gold-ring by the neck and drew himdown, while another strove to smite his head off; but the stout carledrave a wood-knife into the side of the first felon, and drew it outspeedily and smote the other, the smiter, in the face with the sameknife, and therewith they all three rolled together on the earthamongst the feet of men.  Even so did another felon by Bow-may, anddragged her down to the ground, and smote her with a long knife asshe tumbled down; and this was a feat of theirs, for they were long-armed like apes.But as to this felon, Dale-warden's edge split his skull, and Face-of-god gathered his might together and bestrode Bow-may, till he hadhewed a space round about him with great two-handed strokes; and yetthe blade brake not.  Then he caught up Bow-may from the earth, andthe felon's knife had not pierced her hauberk, but she was astonied,and might not stand upon her feet; and Face-of-god turned aside alittle with her, and half bore her, half thrust her through thethrong to the rearward of his folk, and left her there with twocarlines of the Wolf who followed the host for leechcraft's sake, andthen turned back shouting:  'For the Face, for the Face!' and therefollowed him back to the battle, a band of those who were fresh asyet, and their blades unbloodied, the young men of the Woodlands.The wearier fighters made way for them as they came on shouting, andFace-of-god was ahead of them all, and leapt at the foemen as a manunwearied and striking his first stroke, so wondrous hale he was; andthey drave a wedge amidst of the Dusky Men, and then turned about andstood back to back hewing at all that drifted on them.  But as Face-of-god cleared a space about him, lo! almost within reach of hissword-point up rose a grim shape from the earth, tall, grey-haired,and bloody-faced, who uttered the Wolf-whoop from amidst the terrorof his visage, and turned and swung round his head an axe of theDusky Men, and fell to smiting them with their own weapon.  The DuskyMen shrieked in answer to his whoop, and all shrunk from him andFace-of-god; but a cry of joy went up from the kindred, for they knewGold-ring, whom they deemed had been slain.  So they all pressed ontogether, smiting down the foe before them, and the Dusky Men, someturned their backs and drave those behind them, till they too turnedand were strained through the passages and courts of the houses, andsome were overthrown and trodden down as they strove to hold face tothe Woodlanders, and some were hewn down where they stood; but thewhole throng of those that were on their feet drifted toward theMarket-place, the Woodlanders following them ever with point andedge, till betwixt the bent and the houses no foeman stood up againstthem.Then they stood together, and raised the whoop of victory, and blewtheir horns long and loud in token of their joy, and the Woodland menlifted up their voices and sang:   Now far, far aloof   Standeth lintel and roof,   The dwelling of days   Of the Woodland ways:   Now nought wendeth there   Save the wolf and the bear,   And the fox of the waste   Faring soft without haste.No carle the axe whetteth on oak-laden hill;No shaft the hart letteth to wend at his will;None heedeth the thunder-clap over the glade,And the wind-storm thereunder makes no man afraid.Is it thus then that endeth man's days on Mid-earth,For no man there wendeth in sorrow or mirth?   Nay, look down on the road   From the ancient abode!   Betwixt acre and field   Shineth helm, shineth shield.   And high over the heath   Fares the bane in his sheath;   For the wise men and bold   Go their ways o'er the wold.Now the Warrior hath given them heart and fair day,Unbidden, undriven, they fare to the fray.By the rock and the river the banners they bear,And their battle-staves quiver 'neath halbert and spear;On the hill's brow they gather, and hang o'er the DaleAs the clouds of the Father hang, laden with bale.   Down shineth the sun   On the war-deed half done;   All the fore-doomed to die,   In the pale dust they lie.   There they leapt, there they fell,   And their tale shall we tell;   But we, e'en in the gate   Of the war-garth we wait,Till the drift of war-weather shall whistle us on,And we tread all together the way to be won,To the dear land, the dwelling for whose sake we cameTo do deeds for the telling of song-becrowned fame.Settle helm on the head then!  Heave sword for the Dale!Nor be mocked of the dead men for deedless and pale.CHAPTER XLVI.  MEN MEET IN THE MARKET OF SILVER-STEADSo sang they; but Face-of-god went with Red-wolf, who was hurtsorely, but not deadly, and led him back toward the place just underthe break of the bent; and there he found Bow-may in the hands of thewomen who were tending her hurts.  She smiled on him from a pale faceas he drew nigh, and he looked kindly at her, but he might not abidethere, for haste was in his feet.  He left Red-wolf to the tending ofthe women, and clomb the bent hastily, and when he deemed he was highenough, he looked about him; and somewhat more than half an hour hadworn since Bow-may had sped the first shaft against the Dusky Men.He looked down into the Market-stead, and deemed he could see thatnigh the Mote-house the Dusky Men were gathering into some betterorder; but they were no longer drifting toward the southern bents,but were standing round about the altar as men abiding somewhat; andhe deemed that they had gotten more bowshot than before, and thatmost of them bare bows.  Though so many had been slain in the battlesof the southern bents, yet was the Market-stead full of them, so tosay, for others had come thereto in place of those that had fallen.But now as he looked arose mighty clamour amongst them; and a littlewest of the Altar was a stir and a hurrying onward and around as inthe eddies of a swift stream.  Face-of-god wotted not what wasbetiding there, but he deemed that they were now ware of the onfallof Folk-might and Hall-face and the men of Burgdale, for their faceswere all turned to where that was to be looked for.So he turned and looked on the road to the east of him, where hadbeen the battle of the Steer, but now it was all gone down toward theMarket-place, and he could but hear the clamour of it; but nought hesaw thereof, because of the houses that hid it.Then he cast his eyes on the road that entered the Market-stead fromthe north, and he saw thereon many men gathered; and he wotted notwhat they were; for though there were weapons amongst them, yet werethey not all weaponed, as far as he could see.Now as he looked this way and that, and deemed that he must tarry nolonger, but must enter into the courts of the houses before him andmake his way into the Market-stead, lo! a change in the throng ofDusky Warriors nigh the Mote-house, and the ordered bands about theAltar fell to drifting toward the western way with one accord, withgreat noise and hurry and fierce cries of wrath.  Then made Face-of-god no delay, but ran down the bent at once, and at the break of itcame upon Bow-may standing upright and sword in hand; and as hepassed, she joined herself to him, and said:  'What new tidings now,Gold-mane?''Tidings of battle!' he cried; 'tidings of victory!  Folk-might hathfallen on, and the Dusky Men run hastily to meet him.  Hark, hark!'For as he spoke came a great noise of horns, and Bow-may said:  'Whathorn is that blowing?'He stayed not, but shouted aloud:  'For the Face, for the Face!  Nowwill we fall upon their backs!'Therewith was he come to his company, and he cried out to them:'Heard ye the horn, heard ye the horn?  Now follow me into theMarket-place; much is yet to do!'Even therewith came the sound of other horns, and all men were silenta moment, and then shouted all together, for the Wood-landers knew itfor the horn of the Shepherds coming on by the eastward way.But Face-of-god waved his sword aloft and set on at once, and theyfollowed and gat them through the courts of the houses and theirpassages into the Market-place.  There they found more room than theylooked to find; for the foemen had drawn away on the left hand towardthe battle of Folk-might, and on the right hand toward the battle ofthe Steer; and great was the noise and cry that came thence.Now stood Face-of-god under the two banners of the Wolf in theMarket-place of Silver-stead, and scarce had he time to be high-hearted, for needs must he ponder in his mind what thing were best todo.  For on the left hand he deemed the foe was the strongest andbest ordered; but there also were the kindreds the doughtiest, and itwas little like that the felons should overcome the spear-casters ofthe Face and the glaive-bearers of the Sickle, and the bowmen of theVine:  there also were the wisest leaders, as the stark elder Stone-face, and the tall Hall-face, and his father of the unshaken heart,and above all Folk-might, fierce in his wrath, but his anger burningsteady and clear, like the oaken butt on the hearth of the hall.Then as his mind pictured him amongst the foe, it made therewithanother picture of the slender warrior Sun-beam caught in the tangleof battle, and longing for him and calling for him amidst the hardhand-play.  And thereat his face flushed, and all his body waxed hot,and he was on the very point of leading the onset against the foe onthe left.  But therewith he bethought him of the bold men of theSteer and the Bridge and the Bull weary with much fighting; and heremembered also that the Bride was amongst them and fighting, itmight be, amidst the foremost, and if she were slain how should heever hold up his head again.  He bethought him also that theShepherds, who had fallen on by the eastern road, valiant as theywere, were scarce so well armed or so well led as the others.Therewithal he bethought him (and again it came like a picture intohis mind) of falling on the foemen by whom the southern battle wasbeset, and then the twain of them meeting the Shepherds, and lastly,all those three companies joined together clearing the Market-place,and meeting the men under Folk-might in the midst thereof.Therefore, scant had he been pondering these things in his mind for aminute ere he cried out:  'Blow up horns, blow up! forward banners,and follow me, O valiant men! to the helping of the Steer, theBridge, and the Bull; deep have they thrust into the Dusky Throng,and belike are hard pressed.  Hark how the clamour ariseth from theirbesetters!  On now, on!'Therewith hung a star of sunlight on his sword as he raised it aloft,and the Wolf-whoop rang out terribly in the Market-place, for now hadthe Woodlanders also learned it, and the hearts of the foemen sank asthey heard the might and the mass thereof.  Then the battle of theWoodlanders swept round and fell upon the flank of them who werebesetting the kindreds, as an iron bar smiteth the soft fir-wood; andthey of the kindreds heard their cry, but faintly and confusedly, sogreat was the turmoil of battle about them.Now once more was Bow-may by the side of Face-of-god; and if she hadnot the might of the mightiest, yet had she the deftness of thedeftest.  And now was she calm and cool, shielding herself with acopper-bossed target, and driving home the point of her sharp sword;white was her face, and her eyes glittered amidst it, and she seemedto men like to those on whose heads the Warrior hath laid the HolyBread.As to Wood-wise, he had given the Banner of the red-jawed Wolf toStone-wolf, a huge and dreadful warrior some forty winters old, whohad fought in the Great Overthrow, and now hewed down the Dusky Men,wielding a heavy short-sword left-handed.  But Wood-wise himselffought with a great sword, giving great strokes to the right hand andthe left, and was no more hasty than is the hewer in the winter wood.Face-of-god fought wisely and coldly now, and looked more to wardinghis friends than destroying his foes, and both to Bow-may and Wood-wise his sword was a shield; for oft he took the life from the edgeof the upraised axe, and stayed the point of the foeman in mid-air.Even so wisely fought the whole band of the Woodlanders and theWolves, who got within smiting space of the foe; for they had no willto cast away their lives when assured victory was so nigh to them.Sooth to say, the hand-play was not so hard to them as it had beenbetwixt the bent and the houses; for the Dusky Men were intent ondealing with the men of the kindreds from the southern road, whostood war-wearied before them; and they were hewing and casting atthem, and baying and yelling like dogs; and though they turned aboutto meet the storm of the Woodlanders, yet their hearts failed themwithal, and they strove to edge away from betwixt those two fearfulscythes of war, fighting as men fleeing, not as men in onset.  Butstill the Woodlanders and the Wolves came on, hewing and thrusting,smiting down the foemen in heaps, till the Dusky Throng grew thin,and the staves of the Dalesmen and their bright banners in themorning sun were clear to see, and at last their very faces, kindlyand familiar, worn and strained with the stress of battle, orlaughing wildly, or pale with the fury of the fight.  Then rose up tothe heavens the blended shout of the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen,and now there was nought of foemen betwixt them save the dead and thewounded.Then Face-of-god thrust his sword into its sheath all bloody as itwas, and strode over the dead men to where Hall-ward stood under thebanner of the Steer, and cast his arms about the old carle, andkissed him for joy of the victory.  But Hall-ward thrust him abackand looked him in the face, and his cheeks were pale and his lipsclenched, and his eyes haggard and staring, and he said in a harshvoice:'O young man, she is dead!  I saw her fall.  The Bride is dead, andthou hast lost thy troth-plight maiden. O death, death to the DuskyMen!'Then grew Face-of-god as pale as a linen sleeve, and all the new-comers groaned and cried out.  But a bystander said:  'Nay, nay, itis nought so bad as that; she is hurt, and sorely; but she livethyet.'Face-of-god heard him not.  He forgot Dale-warden lying in hissheath, and he saw that the last speaker had a great wood-axe broadand heavy in his hand, so he cried:  'Man, man, thine axe!' andsnatched it from him, and turned about to the foe again, and thrustthrough the ranks, suffering none to stay him till all his friendswere behind and all his foes before him.  And as he burst forth fromthe ranks waving his axe aloft, bare-headed now, his yellow hairflying abroad, his mouth crying out, 'Death, death, death to theDusky Men!' fear of him smote their hearts, and they howled and fledbefore him as they might; for they said that the Dalesmen had prayedtheir Gods into the battle.  But not so fast could they flee but hewas presently amidst them, smiting down all about him, and they soterror-stricken that scarce might they raise a hand against him.  Allthat blended host followed him mad with wrath and victory, and asthey pressed on, they heard behind them the horns and war-cries ofthe Shepherds falling on from the east.  Nought they heeded that now,but drave on a fearful storm of war, and terrible was the slaughterof the Felons.It was but a few minutes ere they had driven them up against thatgreat stack of faggots that had been dight for the burnt-offering ofmen, and many of the felons had mounted up on to it, and now in theiranguish of fear were shooting arrows and casting spears on all aboutthem, heeding little if they were friend or foe.  Now were the men ofthe kindreds at point to climb this twiggen burg; but by this timethe fury of Face-of-god had run clear, and he knew where he was andwhat he was doing; so he stayed his folk, and cried out to them:'Forbear, climb not! let the torch help the sword!'  And therewith helooked about and saw the fire-pot which had been set down there forthe kindling of the bale-fire, and the coals were yet red in it; sohe snatched up a dry brand and lighted it thereat, and so did diversothers, and they thrust them among the faggots, and the fire caughtat once, and the tongues of flame began to leap from faggot to faggottill all was in a light low; for the wood had been laid for that veryend, and smeared with grease and oil so that the burning to the godmight be speedy.But the fierceness of the kindreds heeded not the fire, nor overmuchthe men who leapt down from the stack before it, but they left allbehind them, faring straight toward the western outgate from theMarket-stead; and Face-of-god still led them on; though by now he waswholly come to his right mind again, albeit the burden of sorrow yetlay heavy on his heart.  He had broken his axe, and had once moredrawn Dale-warden from his sheath, and many felt his point and edge.But now, as they chased, came a rush of men upon them again, asthough a new onset were at hand.  That saw Face-of-god and Hall-wardand War-well, and other wise leaders of men, and they bade their folkforbear the chase, and lock their ranks to meet the onfall of thisnew wave of foemen.  And they did so, and stood fast as a wall; butlo! the onrush that drave up against them was but a fleeing shriekingthrong, and no longer an array of warriors, for many had cast awaytheir weapons, and were rushing they knew not whither; for they werebeing thrust on the bitter edges of Face-of-god's companies by theterror of the fleers from the onset of the men of the Face, theSickle, and the Vine, whom Hall-face and Stone-face were leading,along with Folk-might.  Then once again the men of Face-of-god gaveforth the whoop of victory, and pressed forward again, hewing theirway through the throng of fleers, but turning not to chase to theright or the left; while at their backs came on the Shepherd-folk,who had swept down all that withstood them; for now indeed was theMarket-stead getting thinner of living men.So led the War-leader his ordered ranks, till at last over thetangled crowd of runaways he saw the banners of the Burg and the Faceflashing against the sun, and heard the roar of the kindreds as theydrave the chase towards them.  Then he lifted up his sword, and stoodstill, and all the host behind him stayed and cast a huge shout up tothe heavens, and there they abode the coming of the other Dalesmen.But the War-leader sent a message to Hound-under-Greenbury, biddinghim lead the Shepherds to the chase of the Dusky Men, who were nowall fleeing toward the northern outgate of the Market.  Howbeit hecalled to mind the throng he had seen on the northern road beforethey were come into the Market-stead, and deemed that way also deathawaited the foemen, even if the men of the kindreds forbore them.But presently the space betwixt the Woodlanders and the men of theFace was clear of all but the dead, so that friend saw the face offriend; and it could be seen that the warriors of the Face were ruddyand smiling for joy, because the battle had been easy to them, andbut few of them had fallen; for the Dusky Men who had left theMarket-stead to fall on them, had had room for fleeing behind them,and had speedily turned their backs before the spear-casting of themen of the Face and the onrush of the swordsmen.There then stood these victorious men facing one another, and thebanner-bearers on either side came through the throng, and broughtthe banners together between the two hosts; and the Wolf kissed theFace, and the Sickle and the Vine met the Steer and the Bridge andthe Bull:  but the Shepherds were yet chasing the fleers.There in the forefront stood Hall-face the tall, with the joy ofbattle in his eyes.  And Stone-face, the wise carle in war, stoodsolemn and stark beside him; and there was the goodly body and thefair and kindly visage of the Alderman smiling on the faces of hisfriends.  But as for Folk-might, his face was yet white and awefulwith anger, and he looked restlessly up and down the front of thekindreds, though he spake no word.Then Face-of-god could no longer forbear, but he thrust Dale-wardeninto his sheath, and ran forward and cast his arms about his father'sneck and kissed him; and the blood of himself and of the foemen wason him, for he had been hurt in divers places, but not sorely,because of the good hammer-work of the Alderman.Then he kissed his brother and Stone-face, and he took Folk-might bythe hand, and was on the point of speaking some word to him, when theranks of the Face opened, and lo! the Sun-beam in her bright war-gear, and the sword girt to her side, and she unhurt and unsullied.Then was it to him as when he met her first in Shadowy Vale, and hethought of little else than her; but she stepped lightly up to him,and unashamed before the whole host she kissed him on the mouth, andhe cast his mailed arms about her, and joy made him forget manythings and what was next to do, though even at that moment cameafresh a great clamour of shrieks and cries from the northern outgateof the Market-stead:  and the burning pile behind them cast a greatwavering flame into the air, contending with the bright sun of thatfair day, now come hard on noontide.  But ere he drew away his facefrom the Sun-beam's, came memory to him, and a sharp pang shotthrough his heart, as he heard Folk-might say:  'Where then is theShield-may of Burgstead? where is the Bride?'And Face-of-god said under his breath:  'She is dead, she is dead!'And then he stared out straight before him and waited till someoneelse should say it aloud.  But Bow-may stepped forward and said:'Chief of the Wolf, be of good cheer; our kinswoman is hurt, but notdeadly.'The Alderman's face changed, and he said:  'Hast thou seen her, Bow-may?''Nay,' she said.  'How should I leave the battle? but others havetold me who have seen her.'Folk-might stared into the ranks of men before him, but said nothing.Said the Alderman:  'Is she well tended?''Yea, surely,' said Bow-may, 'since she is amongst friends, and thereare no foemen behind us.'Then came a voice from Folk-might which said:  'Now were it best tosend good men and deft in arms, and who know Silver-dale, from houseto house, to search for foemen who may be lurking there.'The Alderman looked kindly and sadly on him and said:'Kinsman Stone-face, and Hall-face my son, the brunt of the battle isnow over, and I am but a simple man amongst you; therefore, if yewill give me leave, I will go see this poor kinswoman of ours, andcomfort her.'They bade him go:  so he sheathed his sword, and went through thepress with two men of the Steer toward the southern road; for theBride had been brought into a house nigh the corner of the Market-place.But Face-of-god looked after his father as he went, and remembranceof past days came upon him, and such a storm of grief swept over him,as he thought of the Bride lying pale and bleeding and brought anighto her death, that he put his hands to his face and wept as a childthat will not be comforted; nor had he any shame of all thosebystanders, who in sooth were men good and kindly, and had no shameof his grief or marvelled at it, for indeed their own hearts weresore for their lovely kinswoman, and many of them also wept withFace-of-god.  But the Sun-beam stood by and looked on her betrothed,and she thought many things of the Bride, and was sorry, albeit notears came into her eyes; then she looked askance at Folk-might andtrembled; but he said coldly, and in a loud voice:'Needs must we search the houses for the lurking felons, or many aman will yet be murdered.  Let Wood-wicked lead a band of men at oncefrom house to house.'Then said a man of the Wolf hight Hardgrip:  'Wood-wicked was slainbetwixt the bent and the houses.'Said Folk-might:  'Let it be Wood-wise then.'But Bow-may said:  'Wood-wise is even now hurt in the leg by awounded felon, and may not go afoot.'Then said Folk-might:  'Is Crow the Shaft-speeder anigh?''Yea, here am I,' quoth a tall man of fifty winters, coming from outthe ranks where stood the Wolves.Said Folk-might:  'Kinsman Crow, do thou take two score and ten ofdoughty men who are not too hot-headed, and search every house aboutthe Market-place; but if ye come on any house that makes a stoutdefence, send ye word thereof to the Mote-house, where we willpresently be, and we shall send you help.  Slay every felon that yefall in with; but if ye find in the houses any of the poor folkcrouching and afraid, comfort their hearts all ye may, and tell themthat now is life come to them.'So Crow fell to getting his band together, and presently departedwith them on his errand.CHAPTER XLVII.  THE KINDREDS WIN THE MOTE-HOUSEThe din and tumult still came from the north side of the Market-place, so that all the air was full of noise; and Face-of-god deemedthat the thralls had gotten weapons into their hands and were slayingtheir masters.Now he lifted up his face, and put his hand on Folk-might's shoulder,and said in a loud voice:'Kinsmen, it were well if our brother were to bid the banners intothe Mote-house of the Wolf, and let all the Host set itself in arraybefore the said house, and abide till the chasers of the foe come tous thither; for I perceive that they are now become many, and aremore than those of our kindred.'Then Folk-might looked at him with kind eyes, and said:'Thou sayest well, brother; even so let it be!'And he lifted up his sword, and Face-of-god cried out in a loudvoice:  'Forward, banners! blow up horns! fare we forth withvictory!'So the Host drew its ranks together in good order, and they all setforward, and old Stone-face took the Sun-beam by the hand and led onbehind Folk-might and the War-leader.  But when they came to theHall, then saw they how the steps that led up to the door were highand double, going up from each side without any railing or fool-guard; and crowding the stairs and the platform thereof was a band ofthe Dusky Men, as many as could stand thereon, who shot arrows at thehost of the kindreds, howling like dogs, and chattering like apes;and arrows and spears came from the windows of the Hall; yea, and onthe very roof a score of these felons were riding the ridge andmocking like the trolls of old days.Now when they saw this they stayed a while, and men shielded themagainst the shafts; but the leaders drew together in front of theHost, and Folk-might fell to speech; and his face was very pale andstern; for now he had had time to think of the case of the Bride, andfierce wrath, and grief unholpen filled his soul.  So he said:'Brothers, this is my business to deal with; for I see before me thestair that leadeth to the Mote-house of my people, and now would Isit there whereas my fathers sat, when peace was on the Dale, as oncemore it shall be to-morrow.  Therefore up this stair will I go, andnone shall hinder me; and let no man of the host follow me till Ihave entered into the Hall, unless perchance I fall dead by the way;but stand ye still and look on.''Nay,' said Face-of-god, 'this is partly the business of the War-leader.  There are two stairs.  Be content to take the southern one,and I will take the northern.  We shall meet on the plain stone atthe top.'But Hall-face said:  'War-leader, may I speak?''Speak, brother,' said Face-of-god.Said Hall-face:  'I have done but little to-day, War-leader.  I wouldstand by thee on the northern stair; so shall Folk-might be content,if he doeth two men's work who are not little-hearted.'Said Face-of-god:  'The doom of the War-leader is that Folk-mightshall fall on by the southern stair to slake his grief and increasehis glory, and Face-of-god and Hall-face by the northern.  Haste tothe work, O brothers!'And he and Hall-face went to their places, while all looked on.  Butthe Sun-beam, with her hand still in Stone-face's, she turned whiteto the lips, and stared with wild eyes before her, not knowing whereshe was; for she had deemed that the battle was over, and Face-of-godsaved from it.But Folk-might tossed up his head and laughed, and cried out, 'Atlast, at last!'  And his sword was in his hand, the Sleep-thorn towit, a blade of ancient fame; so now he let it fall and hang to hiswrist by the leash, while he clapped his hands together and utteredthe Wolf-whoop mightily, and all the men of the Wolf that were in thehost, and the Woodlanders withal, uttered it with him.  Then he puthis shield over his head and stood before the first of the steps, andthe Dusky Men laughed to see one man come against them, though therewas death in their hearts.  But he laughed back at them in triumph,and set his foot on the step, and let Sleep-thorn's point go into thethroat of a Dusky lord, and thrust amongst them, hewing right andleft, and tumbling men over the edge of the stair, which was to themas the narrow path along the cliff-side that hangeth over theunfathomed sea.  They hewed and thrust at him in turn; but so closewere they packed that their weapons crossed about him, and oneshielded him from the other, and they swayed staggering on thatfearful verge, while the Sleep-thorn crept here and there amongstthem, lulling their hot fury.  For, as desperate as they were, andfighting for death and not for life, they had a horror of him and ofthe sea of hatred below them, and feared where to set their feet, andhe feared nought at all, but from feet to sword-point was but anengine of slaughter, while the heart within him throbbed with furylong held back as he thought upon the Bride and her wounding, and allthe wrongs of his people since their Great Undoing.So he smote and thrust, till him-seemed the throng of foes thinnedbefore him:  with his sword-pommel he smote a lord of the Dusky Onesin the face, so that he fell over the edge amongst the spears of thekindred; then he thrust the point of Sleep-thorn towards the Hall-door through the breast of another, and then it seemed to him that hehad but one before him; so he hove up the edges to cleave him down,but ere the stroke fell, close to his ears exceeding loud rang outthe cry, 'For the Burg and the Face! for the Face, for the Face!' andhe drew aback a little, and his eyes cleared, and lo! it was Hall-face the tall, his long sword all reddened with battle; and besidehim stood Face-of-god, silent and panting, his face pale with thefierce anger of the fight, and the weariness which was now at lastgaining upon him.  There stood those three with no other living manupon the plain of the stairs.Then Face-of-god turned shouting to the Folk, and cried:'Forth now with the banners!  For now is the Wolf come home.  On intothe Hall, O Kindred of the Gods!'Then poured the Folk up over the stairs and into the Hall of theWolf, the banners flapping over their heads; and first went the War-leader and Folk-might and Hall-face, and then the three deliveredthralls, Wolf-stone, God-swain, and Spear-fist, and Dallach withthem, though both he and Wolf-stone had been hurt in the battle; andthen came blended together the Men of the Face along with them of theWolf who had entered the Market-stead with them, and with these wereStone-face and Wood-wont and Bow-may, leading the Sun-beam betwixtthem; and now was she come to herself again, though her face was yetpale, and her eyes gleamed as she stepped across the threshold of theHall.But when a many were gotten in, and the first-comers had had time tohandle their weapons and look about them, a cry of the utmost wrathbroke from Folk-might and those others who remembered the Hall fromof old.  For wretched and befouled was that well-builded house:  thehangings rent away; the goodly painted walls daubed and smeared withwicked tokens of the Alien murderers:  the floor, once bright withpolished stones of the mountain, and strewn with sweet-smellingflowers, was now as foul as the den of the man-devouring troll of theheaths.  From the fair-carven roof of oak and chestnut-beams hungugly knots of rags and shapeless images of the sorcery of the DuskyMen.  And furthermore, and above all, from the last tie-beam of theroof over the dais dangled four shapes of men-at-arms, whom the oldermen of the Wolf knew at once for the embalmed bodies of their fourgreat chieftains, who had been slain on the day of the Great Undoing;and they cried out with horror and rage as they saw them hangingthere in their weapons as they had lived.There was the Hostage of the Earth, his shield painted with the greenworld circled with the worm of the sea.  There was the older Folk-might, the uncle of the living man, bearing a shield with an oak anda lion done thereon.  There was Wealth-eker, on whose shield was donea golden sheaf of wheat.  There was he who bore a name great from ofold, Folk-wolf to wit, bearing on his shield the axe of the hewer.There they hung, dusty, befouled, with sightless eyes and grinningmouths, in the dimmed sunlight of the Hall, before the eyes of thatvictorious Host, stricken silent at the sight of them.Underneath them on the dais stood the last remnant of the battle ofthe Dusky Men; and they, as men mad with coming death, shook theirweapons, and with shrieking laughter mocked at the overcomers, andpointed to the long-dead chiefs, and called on them in the tongue ofthe kindreds to come down and lead their dear kinsmen to the high-seat; and then they cried out to the living warriors of the Wolf, andbade them better their deed of slaying, and set to work to make aliveagain, and cause their kinsmen to live merry on the earth.With that last mock they handled their weapons and rushed howling onthe warriors to meet their death; nor was it long denied them; forthe sword of the Wolf, the axe of the Woodland, and the spear of theDale soon made an end of the dreadful lives of these destroyers ofthe Folks.CHAPTER XLVIII.  MEN SING IN THE MOTE-HOUSEThen strode the Warriors of the Wolf over the bodies of the slain onto the dais of their own Hall; and Folk-might led the Sun-beam by thehand, and now was his sword in its sheath, and his face was growncalm, though it was stern and sad.  But even as he trod the daiscomes a slim swain of the Wolves twisting himself through the throng,and so maketh way to Folk-might, and saith to him:'Chieftain, the Alderman of Burgdale sendeth me hither to say a wordto thee; even this, which I am to tell to thee and the War-leaderboth:  It is most true that our kinswoman the Bride will not die, butlive.  So help me, the Warrior and the Face!  This is the word of theAlderman.'When Folk-might heard this, his face changed and he hung his head;and Face-of-god, who was standing close by, beheld him and deemedthat tears were falling from his eyes on to the hall-floor.  As forhim, he grew exceeding glad, and he turned to the Sun-beam and mether eyes, and saw that she could scarce refrain her longing for him;and he was abashed for the sweetness of his love.  But she drew closeup to him, and spake to him softly and said:'This is the day that maketh amends; and yet I long for another day.When I saw thee coming to me that first day in Shadowy Vale, Ithought thee so goodly a warrior that my heart was in my mouth.  Butnow how goodly thou art!  For the battle is over, and we shall live.''Yea,' said Face-of-god, 'and none shall begrudge us our love.Behold thy brother, the hard-heart, the warrior; he weepeth becausehe hath heard that the Bride shall live.  Be sure then that she shallnot gainsay him.  O fair shall the world be to-morrow!'But she said:  'O Gold-mane, I have no words.  Is there no minstrelsyamongst us?'Now by this time were many of the men of the Wolf and the Woodlandersgathered on the dais of the Hall; and the Dalesmen noting this, andwotting that these men were now in their own Mote-house, withdrewthem as they might for the press toward the nether end thereof.  Thatthe Sun-beam noted, and that all those about her save the War-leaderwere of the kindreds of the Wolf and the Woodland, and, stillspeaking softly, she said to Face-of-god:'Gold-mane, meseemeth I am now in my wrong place; for now the Wolfraiseth up his head, but I am departing from him.  Surely I shouldnow be standing amongst my people of the Face, whereto I am going erelong.'He said:  'Beloved, I am now become thy kindred and thine home, andit is meet for thee to stand beside me.'She cast her eyes adown and answered not; and she fell a-pondering ofhow sorely she had desired that fair dale, and now she would leaveit, and be content and more than content.But now the kindreds had sundered, they upon the dais rankedthemselves together there in the House which their fathers hadbuilded; and when they saw themselves so meetly ordered, their heartsbeing full with the sweetness of hope accomplished and the joy ofdeliverance from death, song arose amongst them, and they fell tosinging together; and this is somewhat of their singing:   Now raise we the lay   Of the long-coming day!   Bright, white was the sun   When we saw it begun:   O'er its noon now we live;   It hath ceased not to give;   It shall give, and give more   From the wealth of its store.O fair was the yesterday!  Kindly and goodWas the wasteland our guester, and kind was the wood;Though below us for reaping lay under our handThe harvest of weeping, the grief of the land;Dumb cowered the sorrow, nought daring to cryOn the help of to-morrow, the deed drawing nigh.   All increase throve   In the Dale of our love;   There the ox and the steed   Fed down the mead;   The grapes hung high   'Twixt earth and sky,   And the apples fell   Round the orchard well.Yet drear was the land there, and all was for nought;None put forth a hand there for what the year wrought,And raised it o'erflowing with gifts of the earth.For man's grief was growing beside of the mirthOf the springs and the summers that wasted their wealth;And the birds, the new-comers, made merry by stealth.   Yet here of old   Abode the bold;   Nor had they wailed   Though the wheat had failed,   And the vine no more   Gave forth her store.   Yea, they found the waste good   For the fearless of mood.Then to these, that were dwelling aloof from the Dale,Fared the wild-wind a-telling the worst of the tale;As men bathed in the morning they saw in the poolThe image of scorning, the throne of the fool.The picture was gleaming in helm and in sword,And shone forth its seeming from cups of the board.   Forth then they came   With the battle-flame;   From the Wood and the Waste   And the Dale did they haste:   They saw the storm rise,   And with untroubled eyes   The war-storm they met;   And the rain ruddy-wet.O'er the Dale then was litten the Candle of Day,Night-sorrow was smitten, and gloom fled away.How the grief-shackles sunder!  How many to mornShall awaken and wonder how gladness was born!O wont unto sorrow, how sweet unto youShall be pondering to-morrow what deed is to do!   Fell many a man   'Neath the edges wan,   In the heat of the play   That fashioned the day.   Praise all ye then   The death of men,   And the gift of the aid   Of the unafraid!O strong are the living men mighty to save,And good is their giving, and gifts that we have!But the dead, they that gave us once, never again;Long and long shall they save us sore trouble and pain.O Banner above us, O God of the strong,Love them as ye love us that bore down our wrong!So they sang in the Hall; and there was many a man wept, as the songended, for those that should never see the good days of the Dale, andall the joy that was to be; and men swore, by all that they loved,that they would never forget those that had fallen in the Winning ofSilver-dale; and that when each year the Cups of Memory went round,they should be no mere names to them, but the very men whom they hadknown and loved.CHAPTER XLIX.  DALLACH FARETH TO ROSE-DALE:  CROW TELLETH OF HISERRAND:  THE KINDREDS EAT THEIR MEAT IN SILVER-DALENow Dallach, who had gone away for a while, came back again into theHall; and at his back were a half score of men who bore ladders withthem:  they were stout men, clad in scanty and ragged raiment, butgirt with swords and bearing axes, those of them who were nothandling the ladders.  Men looked on them curiously, because they sawthem to be of the roughest of the thralls.  They were sullen andfierce-eyed to behold, and their hands and bare arms were fleckedwith blood; and it was easy to see that they had been chasing thefleers, and making them pay for their many torments of past days.But when Face-of-god beheld this he cried out:  'Ho, Dallach! is itso that thou hast bethought thee to bring in hither men to fall tothe cleansing of the Hall, and to do away the defiling of the DuskyMen?''Even so, War-leader,' said Dallach; 'also ye shall know that allbattle is over in Silver-stead; for the thralls fell in numbers notto be endured on the Dusky Men who had turned their backs to us, andhindered them from fleeing north.  But though they have slain many,they have not slain all, and the remnant have fled by divers wayswestaway, that they may gain the wood and the ways to Rose-dale; andthe stoutest of the thralls are at their heels, and ever as they gofresh men from the fields join in the chase with great joy.  I havegathered together of the best of them two hundreds and a half well-armed; and if thou wilt give me leave, I will get to me yet more, andfollow hard on the fleers, and so get me home to Rose-dale; forthither will these runaways to meet whatso of their kind may be leftthere.  Also I would fain be there to set some order amongst the poorfolk of mine own people, whom this day's work hath delivered fromtorment.  And if thou wilt suffer a few men of the Dalesmen to comealong with me, then shall all things be better done there.''Luck go with thine hands!' said Face-of-god.  'Take whomso thou wiltof the Burgdalers that have a mind to fare with thee to the number offive score; and send word of thy thriving to Folk-might, thechieftain of the Dale; as for us, meseemeth that we shall abide hereno long while.  How sayest thou, Folk-might, shall Dallach go?'Then Folk-might, who stood close beside him, looked up and reddenedsomewhat, as a man caught heedless when he should be heedful; but helooked kindly on Face-of-god, and said:'War-leader, so long as thou art in the Dale which ye kindreds havewon back for us, thou art the chieftain, and no other, and I bid theedo as thou wilt in this matter, and in all things; and I hereby givecommand to all my kindred to do according to thy will everywhere andalways, as they love me; and indeed I deem that thy will shall betheirs; since it is only fools who know not their well-wishers.  Howsay ye, kinsmen?'Then those about cried out:  'Hail to Face-of-god!  Hail to theDalesmen!  Hail to our friends!'But Folk-might went up to Face-of-god, and threw his arms about himand kissed him, and he said therewithal, so that most men heard him:'Herewith I kiss not only thee, thou goodly and glorious warrior! butthis kiss and embrace is for all the men of the kindreds of the Daleand the Shepherds; since I deem that never have men more valiantdwelt upon the earth.'Therewith all men shouted for joy of him, and were exceeding glad;but Folk-might spake apart to Face-of-god and said:'Brother, I suppose that thou wilt deem it good to abide in this Hallor anigh it; for hereabouts now is the heart of the Host.  But as forme, I would have leave to depart for a little; since I have anerrand, whereof thou mayest wot.'Then Face-of-god smiled on him, and said:  'Go, and all good go withthee; and tell my father that I would have tidings, since I may notbe there.'  So he spake; yet in his heart was he glad that he mightnot go to behold the Bride lying sick and sorry.  But Folk-mightdeparted without more words; and in the door of the Hall he met Crowthe Shaft-speeder, who would have spoken to him, and given him thetidings; but Folk-might said to him:  'Do thine errand to the War-leader, who is within the Hall.'  And so went on his way.Then came Crow up the Hall, and stood before Face-of-god and said:'War-leader, we have done that which was to be done, and have clearedall the houses about the Market-stead.  Moreover, by the rede ofDallach we have set certain men of the poor folk of the Dale, who arewell looked to by the others, to the burying of the slain felons; andthey be digging trenches in the fields on the north side of theMarket-stead, and carry the carcasses thither as they may.  But theslain whom they find of the kindreds do they array out yonder beforethis Hall.  In all wise are these men tame and biddable, save thatthey rage against the Dusky Men, though they fear them yet.  As forus, they deem us Gods come down from heaven to help them.  So muchfor what is good:  now have I an ill word to say; to wit, that in thehouses whereas we have found many thralls alive, yet also have wefound many dead; for amongst these murder-carles were some of an evilsort, who, when they saw that the battle would go against them,rushed into the houses hewing down all before them--man, woman, andchild; so that many of the halls and chambers we saw running bloodlike to shambles.  To be short:  of them whom they were going to hewto the Gods, we have found thirteen living and three dead, of whichlatter is one woman; and of the living, seven women; and all these,living and dead, with the leaden shackles yet on them wherein theyshould be burned.  To all these and others whom we have found, wehave done what of service we could in the way of victual and clothes,so that they scarce believe that they are on this lower earth.Moreover, I have with me two score of them, who are men of some wits,and who know of the stores of victual and other wares which thefelons had, and these will fetch and carry for you as much as yewill.  Is all done rightly, War-leader?''Right well,' said Face-of-god, 'and we give thee our thankstherefor.  And now it were well if these thy folk were to dight ourdinner for us in some green field the nighest that may be, andthither shall all the Host be bidden by sound of horn.  Meantime, letus void this Hall till it be cleansed of the filth of the Dusky Ones;but hereafter shall we come again to it, and light a fire on the HolyHearth, and bid the Gods and the Fathers come back and behold theirchildren sitting glad in the ancient Hall.'Then men shouted and were exceeding joyous; but Face-of-god said oncemore:  'Bear ye a bench out into the Market-place over against thedoor of this Hall:  thereon will I sit with other chieftains of thekindreds, that whoso will may have recourse to us.'So therewith all the men of the kindreds made their ways out of theHall and into the Market-stead, which was by this time much clearedof the slaughtered felons; and the bale for the burnt-offering wasnow but smouldering, and a thin column of blue smoke was going upwavering amidst the light airs of the afternoon.  Men were somewhatsilent now; for they were stiff and weary with the morning's battle;and a many had been hurt withal; and on many there yet rested theafter-grief of battle, and sorrow for the loss of friends and well-wishers.For in the battle had fallen one long hundred and two of the men ofthe Host; and of these were two score and five of the kindreds of theSteer, the Bull, and the Bridge, who had made such valiant onslaughtby the southern road.  Of the Shepherds died one score save three;for though they scattered the foe at once, yet they fell on with suchheadlong valour, rather than wisely, that many were trapped in thethrong of the Dusky Men.  Of the Woodlanders were slain one score andnine; for hard had been the fight about them, and no man of themspared himself one whit.  Of the men of the Wolf, who were but a few,fell sixteen men, and all save two of these in Face-of-god's battle.Of the Burgdale men whom Folk-might led, to wit, them of the Face,the Vine, and the Sickle, were but seven men slain outright.  In thistale are told all those who died of their hurts after the day ofbattle.  Therewithal many others were sorely hurt who mended, andwent about afterwards hale and hearty.So as the folk abode in the Market-place, somewhat faint and weary,they heard horns blow up merrily, and Crow the Shaft-speeder cameforth and stood on the mound of the altar, and bade men fare todinner, and therewith he led the way, bearing in his hand the bannerof the Golden Bushel, of which House he was; and they followed himinto a fair and great mead on the southwest of Silver-stead,besprinkled about with ancient trees of sweet chestnut.  There theyfound the boards spread for them with the best of victual which thepoor down-trodden folk knew how to dight for them; and especially wasthere great plenty of good wine of the sun-smitten bents.So they fell to their meat, and the poor folk, both men and women,served them gladly, though they were somewhat afeard of these fiercesword-wielders, the Gods who had delivered them.  The said thrallswere mostly not of those who had fallen so bitterly on their fleeingmasters, but were men and women of the households, not so roughlytreated as the others, that is to say, those who had been wont totoil under the lash in the fields and the silver-mines, and were aswild as they durst be.As for these waiting-thralls, the men of the kindreds were gentle andblithe with them, and often as they served them would they stay theirhands (and especially if they were women), and would draw down theirheads to put a morsel in their mouths, or set the wine-cup to theirlips; and they would stroke them and caress them, and treat them inall wise as their dear friends.  Moreover, when any man was full, hewould arise and take hold of one of the thralls, and set him in hisplace, and serve him with meat and drink, and talk with him kindly,so that the poor folk were much bewildered with joy.  And the firstthat arose from table were the Sun-beam and Bow-may and Hall-face,with many of the swains and the women of the Woodlanders; and theywent from table to table serving the others.The Sun-beam had done off her armour, and went about exceeding fairand lovely in her kirtle; but Bow-may yet bore her hauberk, for sheloved it, and indeed it was so fine and well-wrought that it was nogreat burden.  Albeit she had gone down with the Sun-beam and otherwomen to a fair stream thereby, and there had they bathed and washedthemselves; and Bow-may's hurts, which were not great, had beenlooked to and bound up afresh, and she had come to table unhelmed,with a wreath of wind-flowers round her head.There then they feasted; and their hearts were strengthened by themeat and drink; and if sorrow were blended with their joy, yet werethey high-hearted through both joy and sorrow, looking forward to thegood days to be in the Dales at the Roots of the Mountains, and thelove and fellowship of Folks and of Houses.But as for Face-of-god, he went not to the meadow, but abode sittingon the bench in the Market-place, where were none else now of thekindreds save the appointed warders.  They had brought him a morseland a cup of wine, and he had eaten and drunk; and now he sat therewith Dale-warden lying sheathed across his knees, and seeming to gazeon the thralls of Silver-dale busied in carrying away the bodies ofthe slain felons, after they had stripped them of their raiment andweapons.  Yet indeed all this was before his eyes as a picture whichhe noted not.  Rather he sat pondering many things; wondering at hisbeing there in Silver-dale in the hour of victory; longing for thepeace of Burgdale and the bride-chamber of the Sun-beam.  Then wenthis thought out toward his old playmate lying hurt in Silver-dale;and his heart was grieved because of her, yet not for long, thoughhis thought still dwelt on her; since he deemed that she would liveand presently be happy--and happy thenceforward for many years.  Sopondered Face-of-god in the Market-place of Silver-dale.CHAPTER L.  FOLK-MIGHT SEETH THE BRIDE AND SPEAKETH WITH HERNow tells the tale of Folk-might, that he went his ways from the Hallto the house where the Bride lay; and the swain who had brought themessage went along with him, and he was proud of walking beside somighty a warrior, and he talked to Folk-might as they went; and thesound of his voice was irksome to the chieftain, but he made asthough he hearkened.  Yet when they came to the door of the house,which was just out of the Place on the Southern road (for thereby hadthe Bride fallen to earth), he could withhold his grief no longer,but turned on the threshold and laid his head on the door-jamb, andsobbed and wept till the tears fell down like rain.  And the boystood by wondering, and wishing that Folk-might would forbearweeping, but durst not speak to him.In a while Folk-might left weeping and went in, and found a fair hallsore befouled by the felons, and in the corner on a bed covered withfurs the wounded woman; and at first sight he deemed her not so paleas he looked to see her, as she lay with her long dark-red hairstrewed over the pillow, her head moving about wearily.  A linencloth was thrown over her body, but her arms lay out of it beforeher.  Beside her sat the Alderman, his face sober enough, but not asone in heavy sorrow; and anigh him was another chair as if someonehad but just got up from it.  There was no one else in the hall savetwo women of the Woodlanders, one of whom was cooking some potion onthe hearth, and another was sweeping the floor anigh of bran or somesuch stuff, which had been thrown down to sop up the blood.So Folk-might went up to the Bride, sorely dreading the image ofdeath which she had grown to be, and sorely loving the woman she wasand would be.He knelt down by the bedside, heeding Iron-face little, though henodded friendly to him, and he held his face close to hers; but shehad her eyes shut and did not open them till he had been there alittle while; and then they opened and fixed themselves on hiswithout surprise or change.  Then she lifted her right hand (for itwas in her left shoulder and side that she had been hurt) and slowlylaid it on his head, and drew his face to hers and kissed it fondly,as she both smiled and let the tears run over from her eyes.  Thenshe spake in a weak voice:'Thou seest, chieftain and dear friend, that I may not stand by thyvictorious side to-day.  And now, though I were fain if thou wouldstnever leave me, yet needs must thou go about thy work, since thou artbecome the Alderman of the Folk of Silver-dale.  Yea, and even ifthou wert not to go from me, yet in a manner should I go from thee.For I am grievously hurt, and I know by myself, and also the leecheshave told me, that the fever is a-coming on me; so that presently Ishall not know thee, but may deem thee to be a woman, or a hound, orthe very Wolf that is the image of the Father of thy kindred; oreven, it may be, someone else--that I have played with time agone.'Her voice faltered and faded out here, and she was silent a while;then she said:'So depart, kind friend and dear love, bearing this word with thee,that should I die, I call on Iron-face my kinsman to bear witnessthat I bid thee carry me to bale in Silver-dale, and lay mine asheswith the ashes of thy Fathers, with whom thine own shall mingle atthe last, since I have been of the warriors who have helped to bringthee aback to the land of thy folk.'Then she smiled and shut her eyes and said:  'And if I live, asindeed I hope, and how glad and glad I shall be to live, then shaltthou bring me to thy house and thy bed, that I may not depart fromthee while both our lives last.'And she opened her eyes and looked at him; and he might not speak fora while, so ravished as he was betwixt joy and sorrow.  But theAlderman arose and took a gold ring from off his arm, and spake:'This is the gold ring of the God of the Face, and I bear it on minearm betwixt the Folk and the God in all man-motes, and I bore itthrough the battle to-day; and it is as holy a ring as may be; andsince ye are plighting troth, and I am the witness thereof, it weregood that ye held this ring together and called the God to witness,who is akin to the God of the Earth, as we all be.  Take the ring,Folk-might, for I trust thee; and of all women now alive would I havethis woman happy.'So Folk-might took the ring and thrust his hand through it, and tookher hand, and said:'Ye Fathers, thou God of the Face, thou Earth-god, thou Warrior, bearwitness that my life and my body are plighted to this woman, theBride of the House of the Steer!'His face was flushed and bright as he spoke, but as his words ceasedhe noted how feebly her hand lay in his, and his face fell, and hegazed on her timidly.  But she lay quiet, and said softly and slowly:'O Fathers of my kindred!  O Warrior and God of the Earth! bearwitness that I plight my troth to this man, to lie in his grave if Idie, and in his bed if I live.'And she smiled on him again, and then closed her eyes; but openedthem presently once more, and said:'Dear friend, how fared it with Gold-mane to-day?'Said Folk-might:  'So well he did, that none might have done better.He fared in the fight as if he had been our Father the Warrior:  heis a great chieftain.'She said:  'Wilt thou give him this message from me, that in no wisehe forget the oath which he swore upon the finger-ring as it lay onthe sundial of the Garden of the Face?  And say, moreover, that I amsorry that we shall part, and have between us such breadth of wild-wood and mountain-neck.''Yea, surely will I give thy message,' said Folk-might; and in hisheart he rejoiced, because he heard her speak as if she were sure oflife.  Then she said faintly:'It is now thy work to depart from me, and to do as it behoveth achieftain of the people and the Alderman of Silver-dale.  Depart,lest the leeches chide me:  farewell, my dear!'So he laid his face to hers and kissed her, and rose up and embracedIron-face, and went his ways without looking back.But just over the threshold he met old Hall-ward of the House of theSteer, who was at point to enter, and he greeted him kindly.  The oldman looked on him steadily, and said:  'To-morrow or the day after Iwill utter a word to thee, O Chief of the Wolf.''In a good hour,' said Folk-might, 'for all thy words are true.'Therewith he gat him away from the house, and came to Face-of-god,where he sat before the altar of the Crooked Sword; and now were thechiefs come back from their meat, and were sitting with him; therealso were Wood-father and Wood-wont; but Bow-may was with the Sun-beam, who was resting softly in the fair meadow after all theturmoil.So men made place for Folk-might beside the War-leader, who lookedupon his face, and saw that it was sober and unsmiling, but not heavyor moody with grief.  So he deemed that all was as well as it mightbe with the Bride, and with a good heart fell to taking counsel withthe others; and kindly and friendly were the redes which they heldthere, with no gainsaying of man by man, for the whole folk was gladat heart.So there they ordered all matters duly for that present time, and bythen they had made an end, it was past sunset, and men were lodged inthe chief houses about the Market-stead.Albeit, though they ate their meat with all joy of heart, and weremerry in converse one with the other, the men of the Wolf would by nomeans feast in their Hall again till it had been cleansed andhallowed anew.CHAPTER LI.  THE DEAD BORNE TO BALE:  THE MOTE-HOUSE RE-HALLOWEDOn the morrow they bore to bale their slain men, and there withalwhat was left of the bodies of the four chieftains of the GreatUndoing.  They brought them into a most fair meadow to the west ofSilver-stead, where they had piled up a very great bale for theburning.  In that meadow was the Doom-ring and Thing-stead of theFolk of the Wolf, and they had hallowed it when they had firstconquered Silver-dale, and it was deemed far holier than the Mote-house aforesaid, wherein the men of the kindred might hold no duecourt; but rather it was a Feast-hall, and a house where men hadconverse together, and wherein precious things and tokens of theFathers were stored up.The Thing-stead in the meadow was flowery and well-grassed, and alittle stream winding about thereby nearly cast a ring around it; andbeyond the stream was a full fair grove of oak-trees, very tall andancient.  There then they burned the dead of the Host, wrapped aboutin exceeding fair raiment.  And when the ashes were gathered, the menof Burgdale and the Shepherds left those of their folk for thekindred to bury there in Silver-dale; for they said that they had aright to claim such guesting for them that had helped to win back theDale.But when the Burning was done and the bale quenched, and the ashesgathered and buried (and that was on the morrow), then men bore forththe Banners of the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand, and the SilverArm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword, and the Wolf of theWoodland; and with great joy and triumph they brought them into theMote-house and hung them up over the dais; and they kindled fire onthe Holy Hearth by holding up a disk of bright glass to the sun; andthen they sang before the banners.  And this is somewhat of the songthat they sang before them:Why are ye wending?  O whence and whither?   What shineth over the fallow swords?What is the joy that ye bear in hither?   What is the tale of your blended words?No whither we wend, but here have we stayed us,   Here by the ancient Holy Hearth;Long have the moons and the years delayed us,   But here are we come from the heart of the dearth.We are the men of joy belated;   We are the wanderers over the waste;We are but they that sat and waited,   Watching the empty winds make haste.Long, long we sat and knew no others,   Save alien folk and the foes of the road;Till late and at last we met our brothers,   And needs must we to the old abode.For once on a day they prayed for guesting;   And how were we then their bede to do?Wild was the waste for the people's resting,   And deep the wealth of the Dale we knew.Here were the boards that we must spread them   Down in the fruitful Dale and dear;Here were the halls where we would bed them:   And how should we tarry otherwhere?Over the waste we came together:   There was the tangle athwart the way;There was the wind-storm and the weather;   The red rain darkened down the day.But that day of the days what grief should let us,   When we saw through the clouds the dale-glad sun?We tore at the tangle that beset us,   And stood at peace when the day was done.Hall of the Happy, take our greeting!   Bid thou the Fathers come and seeThe Folk-signs on thy walls a-meeting,   And deem to-day what men we be.Look on the Holy Hearth new-litten,   How the sparks fly twinkling up aloof!How the wavering smoke by the sunlight smitten,   Curls up around the beam-rich roof!For here once more is the Wolf abiding,   Nor ever more from the Dale shall wend,And never again his head be hiding,   Till all days be dark and the world have end.CHAPTER LII.  OF THE NEW BEGINNING OF GOOD DAYS IN SILVER-DALEOn the third day there was high-tide and great joy amongst all menfrom end to end of the Dale; and the delivered thralls were feastedand made much of by the kindreds, so that they scarce knew how tobelieve their own five senses that told them the good tidings.For none strove to grieve them and torment them; what they would,that did they, and they had all things plenteously; since for all wasthere enough and to spare of goods stored up for the Dusky Men, ascorn and wine and oil and spices, and raiment and silver.  Horseswere there also, and neat and sheep and swine in abundance.  Withalthere was the good and dear land; the waxing corn on the acres; theblossoming vines on the hillside; and about the orchards andalongside the ways, the plum-trees and cherry-trees and pear-treesthat had cast their blossom and were overhung with little youngfruit; and the fair apple-trees a-blossoming, and the chestnutsspreading their boughs from their twisted trunks over the greengrass.  And there was the goodly pasture for the horses and the neat,and the thymy hill-grass for the sheep; and beyond it all, thethicket of the great wood, with its unfailing store of goodly timberof ash and oak and holly and yoke-elm.  There need no man lack unlessman compelled him, and all was rich enough and wide enough for thewaxing of a very great folk.Now, therefore, men betook them to what was their own before thecoming of the Dusky Men; and though at first many of the deliveredthrall-folk feasted somewhat above measure, and though there weresome of them who were not very brisk at working on the earth fortheir livelihood; yet were the most part of them quick of wit anddeft of hand, and they mostly fell to presently at their cunning,both of husbandry and handicraft.  Moreover, they had great love ofthe kindreds, and especially of the Woodlanders, and strove to do allthings that might pleasure them.  And as for those who were dull andlistless because of their many torments of the last ten years, theywould at least fetch and carry willingly for them of the kindreds;and these last grudged them not meat and raiment and house-room, evenif they wrought but little for it, because they called to mind theevil days of their thralldom, and bethought them how few are men'sdays upon the earth.Thus all things throve in Silver-dale, and the days wore on towardthe summer, and the Yule-tide rest beyond it, and the years beyondand far beyond the winning of Silver-dale.CHAPTER LIII.  OF THE WORD WHICH HALL-WARD OF THE STEER HAD FOR FOLK-MIGHTBut of the time then passing, it is to be said that the whole hostabode in Silver-dale in great mirth and good liking, till they shouldhear tidings of Dallach and his company, who had followed hot-foot onthe fleers of the Dusky Men.  And on the tenth day after the battle,Iron-face and his two sons and Stone-face were sitting about sunsetunder a great oak-tree by that stream-side which ran through theMote-stead; there also was Folk-might, somewhat distraught because ofhis love for the Bride, who was now mending of her hurts.  As theysat there in all content they saw folk coming toward them, three innumber, and as they drew nigher they saw that it was old Hall-ward ofthe Steer, and the Sun-beam and Bow-may following him hand in hand.When they came to the brook Bow-may ran up to the elder to help himover the stepping-stones; which she did as one who loved him, as theold man was stark enough to have waded the water waist-deep.  She wasno longer in her war-gear, but was clad after her wont of ShadowyVale, in nought but a white woollen kirtle.  So she stood in thestream beside the stones, and let the swift water ripple up over herankles, while the elder leaned on her shoulder and looked down uponher kindly.  The Sun-beam followed after them, stepping daintily fromstone to stone, so that she was a fair sight to see; her face wassmiling and happy, and as she stepped forth on to the green grass thecolour flushed up in it, but she cast her eyes adown as one somewhatshamefaced.So the chieftains rose up before the leader of the Steer, and Folk-might went up to him, and greeted him, and took his hand and kissedhim on the cheek.  And Hall-ward said:'Hail to the chiefs of the kindred, and my earthly friends!'Then Folk-might bade him sit down by him, and all the men sat downagain; but the Sun-beam leaned her back against a sapling ash hardby, her feet set close together; and Bow-may went to and fro in shortturns, keeping well within ear-shot.Then said Hall-ward:  'Folk-might, I have prayed thy kinswoman Bow-may to lead me to thee, that I might speak with thee; and it is goodthat I find my kinsmen of the Face in thy company; for I would say aword to thee that concerns them somewhat.'Said Folk-might:  'Guest, and warrior of the Steer, thy words areever good; and if this time thou comest to ask aught of me, thenshall they be better than good.'Said Hall-ward:  'Tell me, Folk-might, hast thou seen my daughter theBride to-day?''Yea,' said Folk-might, reddening.'What didst thou deem of her state?' said Hall-ward.Said Folk-might:  'Thou knowest thyself that the fever hath left her,and that she is mending.'Hall-ward said:  'In a few days belike we shall be wending home toBurgdale:  when deemest thou that the Bride may travel, if it werebut on a litter?'Folk-might was silent, and Hall-ward smiled on him and said:'Wouldst thou have her tarry, O chief of the Wolf?''So it is,' said Folk-might, 'that it might be labour lost for her tojourney to Burgdale at present.''Thinkest thou?' said Hall-ward; 'hast thou a mind then that if shegoeth she shall speedily come back hither?''It has been in my mind,' said Folk-might, 'that I should wed her.Wilt thou gainsay it?  I pray thee, Iron-face my friend, and yeStone-face and Hall-face, and thou, Face-of-god, my brother, to laythy words to mine in this matter.'Then said Hall-ward stroking his beard:  'There will be a seatmissing in the Hall of the Steer, and a sore lack in the heart ofmany a man in Burgdale if the Bride come back to us no more.  Welooked not to lose the maiden by her wedding; for it is no long waybetwixt the House of the Steer and the House of the Face.  But now,when I arise in the morning and miss her, I shall take my staff andwalk down the street of Burgstead; for I shall say, The Maiden hathgone to see Iron-face my friend; she is well in the House of theFace.  And then shall I remember how that the wood and the wastes liebetween us.  How sayest thou, Alderman?''A sore lack it will be,' said Iron-face; 'but all good go with her!Though whiles shall I go hatless down Burgstead street, and say, Nowwill I go fetch my daughter the Bride from the House of the Steer;while many a day's journey shall lie betwixt us.'Said Hall-ward:  'I will not beat about the bush, Folk-might; whatgift wilt thou give us for the maiden?'Said Folk-might:  'Whatever is mine shall be thine; and whatsoever ofthe Dale the kindred and the poor folk begrudge thee not, that shaltthou have; and deemest thou that they will begrudge thee aught?  Isit enough?'Hall-ward said:  'I wot not, chieftain; see thou to it!  Bow-may, myfriend, bring hither that which I would have from Silver-dale for theHouse of the Steer in payment for our maiden.'Then Bow-may came forward speedily, and went up to the Sun-beam, andled her by the hand in front of Folk-might and Hall-ward and theother chieftains.  Then Folk-might started, and leapt up from theground; for, sooth to say, he had been thinking so wholly of theBride, that his sister was not in his mind, and he had had no deemingof whither Hall-ward was coming, though the others guessed wellenough, and now smiled on him merrily, when they saw how wild Folk-might stared.  As for the Sun-beam, she stood there blushing like arose in June, but looking her brother straight in the face, as Hall-ward said:'Folk-might, chief of the Wolf, since thou wouldst take our maidenthe Bride away from us, I ask thee to make good her place with thismaiden; so that the House of the Steer may not lack, when they whoare wont to wed therein come to us and pray us for a bedfellow forthe best of their kindred.'Then became Folk-might smiling and merry like unto the others, and hesaid:  'Chief of the Steer, this gift is thine, together with aughtelse which thou mayst desire of us.'Then he kissed the Sun-beam, and said:  'Sister, we looked for thisto befall in some fashion.  Yet we deemed that he that should leadthee away might abide with us for a moon or two.  But now let allthis be, since if thou art not to bear children to the kindreds ofSilver-dale, yet shalt thou bear them to their friends and fellows.And now choose what gift thou wilt have of us to keep us in thymemory.'She said:  'The memory of my people shall not fade from me; yetindeed I ask thee for a gift, to wit, Bow-may, and the two sons ofWood-father that are left since Wood-wicked was slain; and belike theelder and his wife will be fain to go with their sons, and ye willnot hinder them.''Even so shall it be done,' said Folk-might, and he was silent awhile, pondering; and then he said:'Lo you, friends! doth it not seem strange to you that peacesundereth as well as war?  Indeed I deem it grievous that ye shallhave to miss your well-beloved kinswoman.  And for me, I am now grownso used to this woman my sister, though at whiles she hath beenmasterful with me, that I shall often turn about and think to speakto her, when there lie long days of wood and waste betwixt her voiceand mine.The Sun-beam laughed in his face, though the tears stood in her eyes,as she said:  'Keep up thine heart, brother; for at least the way isshorter betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale than betwixt life and death;and the road we shall learn belike.'Said Hall-face:  'So it is that my brother is no ill woodman, as yelearned last autumn.'Iron-face smiled, but somewhat sadly; for he beheld Face-of-god, whohad no eyes for anyone save the Sun-beam; and no marvel was that, fornever had she looked fairer.  And forsooth the War-leader was notutterly well-pleased; for he was deeming that there would be delayingof his wedding, now that the Sun-beam was to become a maid of theSteer; and in his mind he half deemed that it would be better if hewere to take her by the hand and lead her home through the wild-wood,he and she alone; and she looked on him shyly, as though she had adeeming of his thought.  Albeit he knew it might not be, that he, thechosen War-leader, should trouble the peace of the kindred; for hewotted that all this was done for peace' sake.So Hall-ward stood forth and took the Sun-beam's right hand in his,and said:'Now do I take this maiden, Sun-beam of the kindred of the Wolf, andlead her into the House of the Steer, to be in all ways one of themaidens of our House, and to wed in the blood wherein we have beenwont to wed.  Neither from henceforth let anyone say that this womanis not of the blood of the Steer; for we have given her our blood,and she is of us duly and truly.'Thereafter they talked together merrily for a little, and then turnedtoward the houses, for the sun was now down; and as they went Iron-face spake to his son, and said:'Gold-mane, wilt thou verily keep thine oath to wed the fairest womanin the world?  By how much is this one fairer than my dear daughterwho shall no more dwell in mine house?'Said Face-of-god:  'Yea, father, I shall keep mine oath; for theGods, who know much, know that when I swore last Yule I was thinkingof the fair woman going yonder beside Hall-ward, and of none other.''Ah, son!' said Iron-face, 'why didst thou beguile us?  Hadst thoubut told us the truth then!''Yea, Alderman,' said Face-of-god smiling, 'and how thou wouldesthave raged against me then, when thou hast scarce forgiven me now!In sooth, father, I feared to tell you all:  I was young; I was oneagainst the world.  Yea, yea; and even that was sweet to me, sosorely as I loved her--Hast thou forgotten, father?'Iron-face smiled, and answered not; and so came they to the housewherein they were guested.CHAPTER LIV.  TIDINGS OF DALLACH:  A FOLK-MOTE IN SILVER-DALEThree days thereafter came two swift runners from Rose-dale withtidings of Dallach.  In all wise had he thriven, and had slain manyof the runaways, and had come happily to Rose-dale:  therein by themere shaking of their swords had they all their will; for there werebut a few of the Dusky Warriors in the Dale, since the more part hadfared to the slaughter in Silver-stead.  Now therefore had Dallachbeen made Alderman of Rose-dale; and the Burgdalers who had gone withhim should abide the coming thither of the rest of the Burgdale Host,and meantime of their coming should uphold the new Alderman in Rose-dale.  Howbeit Dallach sent word that it was not to be doubted butthat many of the Dusky Men had escaped to the woods, and should yetbe the death of many a mother's son, unless it were well looked to.And now the more part of the Burgdale men and the Shepherds began tolook toward home, albeit some amongst them had not been ill-pleasedto abide there yet a while; for life was exceeding soft to themthere, though they helped the poor folk gladly in their husbandry.For especially the women of the Dale, of whom many were very goodly,hankered after the fair-faced tall Burgdalers, and were as kind tothem as might be.  Forsooth not a few, both carles and queens, of theold thrall-folk prayed them of Burgdale to take them home thither,that they might see new things and forget their old torments once forall, yea, even in dreams.  The Burgdalers would not gainsay them, andthere was no one else to hinder; so that there went with the Burgdalemen at their departure hard on five score of the Silver-dale folk whowere not of the kindreds.And now was a great Folk-mote holden in Silver-dale, whereto theBurgdale men and the Shepherds were bidden; and thereat the War-leader gave out the morrow of the morrow for the day of the departureof the Host.  There also were the matters of Silver-dale dulyordered:  the Men of the Wolf would have had the Woodlanders dwellwith them in the fair-builded stead, and take to them of the goodlystone houses there what they would; but this they naysaid, choosingrather to dwell in scattered houses, which they built for themselvesat the utmost limit of the tillage.Indeed, the most abode not even there a long while; for they lovedthe wood and its deeds.  So they went forth into the wood, andcleared them space to dwell in, and builded them halls such as theyloved, and fell to their old woodland crafts of charcoal-burning andhunting, wherein they throve well.  And good for Silver-dale wastheir abiding there, since they became a sure defence and stoutoutpost against all foemen.  For the rest, wheresoever they dwelt,they were guest-cherishing and blithe, and were well beloved by allpeople; and they wedded with the other Houses of the Children of theWolf.As to the other matters whereof they took rede at this Folk-mote,they had mostly to do with the warding of the Dale, and the learningof the delivered thralls to handle weapons duly.  For men deemed itmost like that they would have to meet other men of the kindred ofthe Felons; which indeed fell out as the years wore.Moreover, Folk-might (by the rede of Stone-face) sent messengers tothe Plain and the Cities, unto men whom he knew there, doing them towit of the tidings of Silver-dale, and how that a peaceful and guest-loving people, having good store of wares, now dwelt therein, so thatchapmen might have recourse thither.Lastly spake Folk-might and said:'Guests and brothers-in-arms, we have been looking about our newhouse, which was our old one, and therein we find great store ofwares which we need not, and which we can but use if ye use them.  Ofyour kindness therefore we pray you to take of those things what yecan easily carry.  And if ye say the way is long, as indeed it is,since ye are bent on going through the wood to Rose-dale, and so onto Burgdale, yet shall we furnish you with beasts to bear your goods,and with such wains as may pass through the woodland ways.'Then rose up Fox of Upton and said:  'O Folk-might, and ye men of theWolf, be it known unto you, that if we have done anything for yourhelp in the winning of Silver-dale, we have thus done that we mighthelp ourselves also, so that we might live in peace henceforward, andthat we might have your friendship and fellowship therewithal, sothat here in Silver-dale might wax a mighty folk who joined unto usshould be strong enough to face the whole world.  Such are the redesof wise men when they go a-warring.  But we have no will to go backhome again made rich with your wealth; this hath been far from ourthought in this matter.'And there went up a murmur from all the Burgdalers yeasaying hisword.But Folk-might took up the word again and spake:'Men of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, what ye say is both manly andfriendly; yet, since we look to see a road made plain through thewoodland betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale, and that often ye shallface us in the feast-hall, and whiles stand beside us in the fray, wemust needs pray you not to shame us by departing empty-handed; forhow then may we look upon your faces again?  Stone-face, my friend,thou art old and wise; therefore I bid thee to help us herein, andspeak for us to thy kindred, that they naysay us not in this matter.'Then stood up Stone-face and said:  'Forsooth, friends, Folk-might isin the right herein; for he may look for anger from the wights thatcome and go betwixt his kindred and the Gods, if they see us faringback giftless through the woods.  Moreover, now that ye have seenSilver-dale, ye may wot how rich a land it is of all good things, andable to bring forth enough and to spare.  And now meseemeth the Godslove this Folk that shall dwell here; and they shall become a mightyFolk, and a part of our very selves.  Therefore let us take the giftsof our friends, and thank them blithely.  For surely, as saith Folk-might, henceforth the wood shall become a road betwixt us, and thethicket a halting-place for friends bearing goodwill in their hands.'When he had spoken, men yeasaid his words and forbore the gifts nolonger; and the Folk-mote sundered in all loving-kindness.CHAPTER LV.  DEPARTURE FROM SILVER-DALEOn morrow of the morrow were the Burgdale men and they of theShepherds gathered together in the Market-stead early in the morning,and they were all ready for departure; and the men of the Wolf andthe Woodlanders, and of the delivered thralls a great many, stoodround about them grieving that they must go.  There was much talkbetween the folk of the Dale and the Guests, and many promises weregiven and taken to come and go betwixt the two Dales.  There alsowere the men of the thrall-folk who were to wend home with theBurgdalers; and they had been stuffed with good things by the men ofthe kindreds, and were as fain as might be.As for the Sun-beam, she was somewhat out of herself at first, beingeager and restless beyond her wont, and yet at whiles weeping-ripewhen she called to mind that she was now leaving all those things,the gain whereof had been a dream to her both waking and sleeping forthese years past.  But at last, as she stood in the door of the Mote-house, and beheld all the throng of folk happy and friendly, it cameover her that she herself had done her full share to bring all thisabout, and that all those pleasant places of Silver-dale now full ofthe goodly life of man would be there even as she had striven forthem, and that they would be a part of her left behind, though shewere dwelling otherwhere.Therewithal she said to herself that it was now her part to wield thelife of men in Burgdale, and begin once more her days of a chieftainand a swayer of the Folk, and the life of a stirring woman, which theedge of the sword and the need of the hard hand-play had taken out ofher hands for a while, making her as a child in the hands of thestrong wielders of the blades.So now she became calm once more, and her face was clad again withthe full measure of that majesty of beauty which had once overawedFace-of-god amidst his love of her; and folk beheld her and marvelledat her fairness, and said:  'She hath an inward sorrow at leaving thefair Dale wherein her Fathers dwelt, and where her mother's ashes liein earth.'  Albeit now was her sorrow but little, and much was herhope, and her foresight of days to be; though all the Dale, yea,every leaf and twig of it whereby her feet had ever passed, and eachstone of the fair houses, was to her as a picture that she could lookon from henceforth for ever.Of the Bride it is to be said that she was now much mended, and shecaused men bear her on a litter out into the Marketplace, that shemight look on the departure of her folk.  She had seen Face-of-godonce and again since the Day of Battle, and each time had been kindand blithe with him; and for Iron-face, she loved him so well thatshe was ever loth to let him depart from her, save when Folk-mightwas with her.And now was the Alderman standing beside her, and she said to him:'Friend and kinsman, this is the day of departure, and though I mustneeds abide behind, and am content to abide, yet doth mine heart achewith the sundering; for to-morrow when I wake in the morning therewill be no more sending of a messenger to fetch thee to me.  Indeed,great hath been the love between me and my people, and nought hathcome between us to mar it.  Now, kinsman, I would see Gold-mane, mycousin, that I may bid him farewell; for who knoweth if I shall seehim again hereafter?'Then went Iron-face and found Face-of-god where he was speaking withFolk-might and the chieftains, and said to him:'Come quickly, for thy cousin the Bride would speak with thee.'Face-of-god reddened, and paled afterwards, but he went along withhis father silently; and his heart beat as he came and stood beforethe litter whereas the Bride lay, clad all in white and propped up onfair cushions of red silk.  She was frail to look on, and worn andpale yet; but he deemed that she was very happy.She smiled on him, and reached out her hand and said:'Welcome once more, cousin!'  And he held her hand and kissed it, andwas nigh weeping, so sore was he beset by a throng of memoriesconcerning her and him in the days when they were little; and hebethought him of her loving-kindness of past days, beyond that ofmost children, beyond that of most maidens; and how there was nothingin his life but she had a share in it, till the day when he found theHall on the Mountain.So he said to her:  'Kinswoman, is it well with thee?''Yea,' she said, 'I am now nigh whole of my hurts.'He was silent a while; then he said:'And otherwise art thou merry at heart?''Yea, indeed,' said she; 'yet thou wilt not find it hard to deem thatI am sorry of the sundering betwixt me and Burgdale.'Again was he silent, and said in a while:  'Dost thou deem that Iwrought that sundering?'She smiled kindly on him and said:  'Gold-mane, my playmate, thou artbecome a mighty warrior and a great chief; but thou art not so mightyas that.  Many things lay behind the sundering which were neitherthou nor I.''Yet,' said he, 'it was but such a little time agone that all thingsseemed so sure; and we--to both of us was the outlook happy.''Let it be happy still,' she said, 'now begrudging is gone.  Belikethe sundering came because we were so sure, and had no defenceagainst the wearing of the days; even as it fareth with a folk thathath no foes.'He smiled and said:  'Even as it hath befallen THY folk, O Bride, awhile ago.'She reddened, and reached her hand to him, and he took it and heldit, and said:  'Shall I see thee again as the days wear?'Said she:  'O chieftain of the Folk, thou shalt have much to do inBurgdale, and the way is long.  Yet would I have thee see mychildren.  Forget not the token on my hand which thou holdest.  Butnow get thee to thy folk with no more words; for after all, playmate,the sundering is grievous to me, and I would not spin out the timethereof.  Farewell!'He said no more, but stooped down and kissed her lips, and thenturned from her, and took his ways to the head of the Host, and fellto asking and answering, and bidding and arraying; and in a littletime was his heart dancing with joy to think of the days that laybefore him, wherein now all seemed happy.So was all arrayed for departure when it lacked three hours of noon.As Folk-might had promised, there were certain light wains drawn bybullocks abiding the departure of the Host, and of sumpter bullocksand horses no few; and all these were laden with fair gifts of theDale, as silver, and raiment, and weapons.  There were many thingsfair-wrought in the time of the Sorrow, that henceforth should seebut little sorrow.  Moreover, there was plenty of provision for theway, both meal and wine, and sheep and neat; and all things as fairas might be, and well-arrayed.It was the Shepherds who were to lead the way; and after them werearrayed the men of the Vine and the Sickle; then they of the Steer,the Bridge, and the Bull; and lastly the House of the Face, with oldStone-face leading them.  The Sun-beam was to journey along with theHouse of the Steer, which had taken her in as a maiden of theirblood; and though she had so much liefer have fared with the House ofthe Face, yet she went meekly as she was bidden, as one who hasgotten a great thing, and will make no stir about a small one.Along with her were Wood-father and Wood-mother, and Wood-wise, nowwhole of his hurt, and Wood-wont, and Bow-may.  Save Bow-may, theywere not very joyous; for they were fain of Silver-dale, and it irkedthem to leave it; moreover, they also had liefer have gone along withthe House of the War-leader.Last of all went those people of the once thralls of the Dusky Menwho had cast in their lot with the Burgdalers, and they wereexceeding merry; and especially the women of them, they werechattering like the stares in the autumn evening, when they gatherfrom the fields in the tall elm-trees before they go to roost.Now all the men of the Dale, both of the kindreds and of the thrall-folk, made way for the Host and its havings, that they might go theirways down the Dale; albeit the Woodlanders clung close to the line oftheir ancient friends, and with them, as men who were sorry for thesundering, were Wolf-stone and God-swain and Spear-fist.  But thechiefs, they drew around Folk-might a little beside the way.Now Red-coat of Waterless, who had been hurt, and was now wholeagain, cast his arms about Folk-might and kissed him, and said:'All the way hence to Burgdale will I sow with good wishes for theeand thine, and especially for my dear friend God-swain of the SilverArm; and I would wish and long that they might turn into spells todraw thy feet to usward; for we love thee well.'In like wise spake other of the Burgdalers; and Folk-might was kindand blithe with them, and he said:'Friends, forget ye not that the way is no longer from you to us thanit is from us to you.  One half of this matter it is for you to dealwith.''True is that,' said Red-beard of the Knolls, 'but look you, Folk-might, we be but simple husbandmen, and may not often stir from ourmeadows and acres; even now I bethink me that May is amidst us, and Iam beginning to be drawn by the thought of the haysel.  Whereas thou--' (and therewith he reddened) 'I doubt that thou hast little to dosave the work of chieftains, and we know that such work is but littlemissed if it be undone.'Thereat Folk-might laughed; and when the others saw that he laughed,they laughed also, else had they foreborne for courtesy's sake.But Folk-might answered:  'Nay, chief of the Sickle, I am notaltogether a chieftain, now we have gotten us peace; and somewhat ofa husbandman shall I be.  Moreover, doubt ye not that I shall do myutmost to behold the fair Dale again; for it is but mountains thatmeet not.'Now spake Face-of-god to Folk-might, smiling and somewhat softly, andsaid:  'Is all forgiven now, since the day when we first felt eachother's arms?''Yea, all,' said Folk-might; 'now hath befallen what I foretold theein Shadowy Vale, that thou mightest pay for all that had come andgone, if thou wouldest but look to it.  Indeed thou wert angry withme for that saying on that eve of Shadowy Vale; but see thou, inthose days I was an older man than thou, and might admonish theesomewhat; but now, though but few days have gone over thine head, yetmany deeds have abided in thine hand, and thou art much aged.  Angerhath left thee, and wisdom hath waxed in thee.  As for me, I may nowsay this word:  May the Folk of Burgdale love the Folk of Silver-daleas well as I love thee; then shall all be well.'Then Face-of-god cast his arms about him and kissed him, and turnedaway toward Stone-face and Hall-face his brother, where they stood atthe head of the array of the Face; and even therewith came up theAlderman somewhat sad and sober of countenance, and he pushed by theWar-leader roughly and would not speak with him.And now blew up the horns of the Shepherds, and they began to move onamidst the shouting of the men of Silver-dale; yet were there amongstthe Woodlanders those who wept when they saw their friends verilydeparting from them.But when they of the foremost of the Host were gotten so far forwardthat the men of the Face could begin to move, lo! there was Redesmanwith his fiddle amongst the leaders; and he had done a man's work inthe day of battle, and all looked kindly on him.  About him on thismorn were some who had learned the craft of singing well together,and knew his minstrelsy, and he turned to these and nodded as theirarray moved on, and he drew his bow across the strings, andstraightway they fell a-singing, even as it might be thus:Back again to the dear Dale where born was the kindred,   Here wend we all living, and liveth our mirth.Here afoot fares our joyance, whatever men hindred,   Through all wrath of the heavens, all storms of the earth.O true, we have left here a part of our treasure,   The ashes of stout ones, the stems of the shield;But the bold lives they spended have sown us new pleasure,   Fair tales for the telling in fold and on field.For as oft as we sing of their edges' upheaving,   When the yellowing windows shine forth o'er the night,Their names unforgotten with song interweaving   Shall draw forth dear drops from the depths of delight.Or when down by our feet the grey sickles are lying,   And behind us is curling the supper-tide smoke,No whit shall they grudge us the joyance undying,   Remembrance of men that put from us the yoke.When the huddle of ewes from the fells we have driven,   And we see down the Dale the grey reach of the roof,We shall tell of the gift in the battle-joy given,   All the fierceness of friends that drave sorrow aloof.Once then we lamented, and mourned them departed;   Once only, no oftener.  Henceforth shall we flingTheir names up aloft, when the merriest hearted   To the Fathers unseen of our life-days we sing.Then was there silence in the ranks of men; and many murmured thenames of the fallen as they fared on their way from out the Market-place of Silver-stead.  Then once more Redesman and his mates took upthe song:Come tell me, O friends, for whom bideth the maiden   Wet-foot from the river-ford down in the Dale?For whom hath the goodwife the ox-waggon laden   With the babble of children, brown-handed and hale?Come tell me for what are the women abiding,   Till each on the other aweary they lean?Is it loitering of evil that thus they are chiding,   The slow-footed bearers of sorrow unseen?Nay, yet were they toiling if sorrow had worn them,   Or hushed had they bided with lips parched and wan.The birds of the air other tidings have borne them -   How glad through the wood goeth man beside man.Then fare forth, O valiant, and loiter no longer   Than the cry of the cuckoo when May is at hand;Late waxeth the spring-tide, and daylight grows longer,   And nightly the star-street hangs high o'er the land.Many lives, many days for the Dale do ye carry;   When the Host breaketh out from the thicket unshorn,It shall be as the sun that refuseth to tarry   On the crown of all mornings, the Midsummer morn.Again the song fell down till they were well on the western way downSilver-dale; and then Redesman handled his fiddle once more, andagain the song rose up, and such-like were the words which were borneback into the Market-place of Silver-stead:And yet what is this, and why fare ye so slowly,   While our echoing halls of our voices are dumb,And abideth unlitten the hearth-brand the holy,   And the feet of the kind fare afield till we come?For not yet through the wood and its tangle ye wander;   Now skirt we no thicket, no path by the mere;Far aloof for our feet leads the Dale-road out yonder;   Full fair is the morning, its doings all clear.There is nought now our feet on the highway delaying   Save the friend's loving-kindness, the sundering of speech;The well-willer's word that ends words with the saying,   The loth to depart while each looketh on each.Fare on then, for nought are ye laden with sorrow;   The love of this land do ye bear with you still.In two Dales of the earth for to-day and to-morrow   Is waxing the oak-tree of peace and good-will.Thus then they departed from Silver-dale, even as men who were aportion thereof, and had not utterly left it behind.  And that nightthey lay in the wild-wood not very far from the Dale's end; for theywent softly, faring amongst so many friends.CHAPTER LVI.  TALK UPON THE WILD-WOOD WAYOn the morrow morning when they were on their way again Face-of-godleft his own folk to go with the House of the Steer a while; andamongst them he fell in with the Sun-beam going along with Bow-may.So they greeted him kindly, and Face-of-god fell into talk with theSun-beam as they went side by side through a great oak-wood, wherefor a space was plain green-sward bare of all underwood.So in their talk he said to her:  'What deemest thou, my speech-friend, concerning our coming back to guest in Silver-dale one day?''The way is long,' she said.'That may hinder us but not stay us,' said Face-of-god.'That is sooth,' said the Sun-beam.Said Face-of-god:  'What things shall stay us?  Or deemest thou thatwe shall never see Silver-dale again?'She smiled:  'Even so I think thou deemest, Gold-mane.  But manythings shall hinder us besides the long road.'Said he:  'Yea, and what things?''Thinkest thou,' said the Sun-beam, 'that the winning of Silver-steadis the last battle which thou shalt see?''Nay,' said he, 'nay.''Shall thy Dale--our Dale--be free from all trouble within itselfhenceforward?  Is there a wall built round it to keep out for everstorm, pestilence, and famine, and the waywardness of its own folk?''So it is as thou sayest,' quoth Face-of-god, 'and to meet suchtroubles and overcome them, or to die in strife with them, this is agreat part of a man's life.''Yea,' she said, 'and hast thou forgotten that thou art now a greatchieftain, and that the folk shall look to thee to use thee many daysin the year?'He laughed and said:  'So it is.  How many days have gone by since Iwandered in the wood last autumn, that the world should have changedso much!''Many deeds shall now be in thy days,' she said, 'and each deed asthe corn of wheat from which cometh many corns; and a man's days onthe earth are not over many.''Then farewell, Silver-dale!' said he, waving his hand toward thenorth.  'War and trouble may bring me back to thee, but it maybenought else shall.  Farewell!'She looked on him fondly but unsmiling, as he went beside her strongand warrior-like.  Three paces from him went Bow-may, barefoot, inher white kirtle, but bearing her bow in her hand; a leash of arrowswas in her girdle, her quiver hung at her back, and she was girt witha sword.  On the other side went Wood-wont and Wood-wise, lightlyclad but weaponed.  Wood-mother was riding in an ox-wain just behindthem, and Wood-father went beside her bearing an axe.  Scattered allabout them were the men of the Steer, gaily clad, bearing weapons, sothat the oak-wood was bright with them, and the glades merry withtheir talk and singing and laughter, and before them down the gladeswent the banner of the Steer, and the White Beast led them thenearest way to Burgdale.CHAPTER LVII.  HOW THE HOST CAME HOME AGAINIt was fourteen days before they came to Rose-dale; for they had muchbaggage with them, and they had no mind to weary themselves, and thewood was nothing loathsome to them, whereas the weather was fair andbright for the more part.  They fell in with no mishap by the way.But a score and three of runaways joined themselves to the Host,having watched their goings and wotting that they were not foemen.Of these, some had heard of the overthrow of the Dusky Men in Silver-dale, and others not.  The Burgdalers received them all, for itseemed to them no great matter for a score or so of new-comers to theDale.But when the Host was come to Rose-dale, they found it fair aridlovely; and there they met with those of their folk who had gone withDallach.  But Dallach welcomed the kindreds with great joy, and badethem abide; for he said that they had the less need to hasten, sincehe had sent messengers into Burgdale to tell men there of thetidings.  Albeit they were mostly loth to tarry; yet when he lay hardon them not to depart as men on the morrow of a gild-feast, theyabode there three days, and were as well guested as might be, and ontheir departure they were laden with gifts from the wealth of Rose-dale by Dallach and his folk.Before they went their ways Dallach spake with Face-of-god and thechiefs of the Dalesmen, and said:'Ye have given me much from the time when ye found me in the wood anaked wastrel; yet now I would ask you a gift to lay on the top ofall that ye have given me.'Said Face-of-god:  'Name the gift, and thou shalt have it; for wedeem thee our friend.''I am no less,' said Dallach, 'as in time to come I may perchance beable to show you.  But now I am asking you to suffer a score or twoof your men to abide here with me this summer, till I see how thisfolk new-born again is like to deal with me.  For pleasure and a fairlife have become so strange to them, that they scarce know what to dowith them, or how to live; and unless all is to go awry, I must needscommand and forbid; and though belike they love me, yet they fear menot; so that when my commandment pleaseth them, they do as I bid, andwhen it pleaseth them not, they do contrary to my bidding; for ithath got into their minds that I shall in no case lift a hand againstthem, which indeed is the very sooth.  But your folk they fear aswarriors of the world, who have slain the Dusky Men in the Market-place of Silver-stead; and they are of alien blood to them, men whowill do as their friend biddeth (think our folk) against them who areneither friends or foes.  With such help I shall be well holpen.'In such wise spake Dallach; and Face-of-god and the chiefs said thatso it should be, if men could be found willing to abide in Rose-dalefor a while.  And when the matter was put abroad, there was no lackof such men amongst the younger warriors, who had noted that the dalewas fair amongst dales and its women fairer yet amongst women.So two score and ten of the Burgdale men abode in Rose-dale, no oneof whom was of more than twenty and five winters.  Forsooth divers ofthem set up house in Rose-dale, and never came back to Burgdale, saveas guests.  For a half score were wedded in Rose-dale before theyear's ending; and seven more, who had also taken to them wives ofthe goodliest of the Rose-dale women, betook them the next spring tothe Burg of the Runaways, and there built them a stead, and drew agarth about it, and dug and sowed the banks of the river, which theycalled Inglebourne.  And as years passed, this same stead throveexceedingly, and men resorted thither both from Rose-dale andBurgdale; for it was a pleasant place; and the land, when it wascured, was sweet and good, and the wood thereabout was full of deerof all kinds.  So their stead was called Inglebourne after thestream; and in latter days it became a very goodly habitation of men.Moreover, some of the once-enthralled folk of Rose-dale, when theyknew that men of their kindred from Silver-dale were going home withthe men of Burgdale to dwell in the Dale, prayed hard to go alongwith them; for they looked on the Burgdalers as if they were new Godsof the Earth.  The Burgdale chiefs would not gainsay these meneither, but took with them three score and ten from Rose-dale, menand women, and promised them dwelling and livelihood in Burgdale.So now with good hearts the Host of Burgdale turned their facestoward their well-beloved Dale; and they made good diligence, so thatin three days' time they were come anigh the edge of the woodlandwilderness.  Thither in the even-tide, as they were making ready fortheir last supper and bed in the wood, came three men and two womenof their folk, who had been abiding their coming ever since they hadhad the tidings of Silver-dale and the battles from Dallach.  Greatwas the joy of these messengers as they went from company to companyof the warriors, and saw the familiar faces of their friends, andheard their wonted voices telling all the story of battle andslaughter.  And for their part the men of the Host feasted thesestay-at-homes, and made much of them.  But one of them, a man of theHouse of the Face, left the Host a little after nightfall, and boreback to Burgstead at once the tidings of the coming home of the Host.Albeit since Dallach's tidings of victory had come to the Dale, thedwellers in the steads of the country-side had left Burgstead andgone home to their own houses; so that there was no great multitudeabiding in the Thorp.So early on the morrow was the Host astir; but ere they came toWildlake's Way, the Shepherd-folk turned aside westward to go home,after they had bidden farewell to their friends and fellows of theDale; for their souls longed for the sheepcotes in the windingvalleys under the long grey downs; and the garths where the lastyear's ricks shouldered up against the old stone gables, and wherethe daws were busy in the tall unfrequent ash-trees; and the greenflowery meadows adown along the bright streams, where the crowfootand the paigles were blooming now, and the harebells were in flowerabout the thorn-bushes at the down's foot, whence went the savour oftheir blossom over sheep-walk and water-meadow.So these went their ways with many kind words; and two hoursafterwards all the rest of the Host stood on the level ground of thePortway; but presently were the ranks of war disordered and broken upby the joy of the women and children, as they fell to drawing goodmanor brother or lover out of the throng to the way that led speediestto their homesteads and halls.  For the War-leader would not hold theHost together any longer, but suffered each man to go to his home,deeming that the men of Burgstead, and chiefly they of the Face andthe Steer, would suffice for a company if any need were, and theywould be easily gathered to meet any hap.So now the men of the Middle and Lower Dale made for their houses bythe road and the lanes and the meadows, and the men of the Upper Daleand Burgstead went their ways along the Portway toward their halls,with the throng of women and children that had come out to meet them.And now men came home when it was yet early, and the long day laybefore them; and it was, as it were, made giddy and cumbered with theexceeding joy of return, and the thought of the day when the fear ofdeath and sundering had been ever in their hearts.  For these newhours were full of the kissing and embracing of lovers, and thesweetness of renewed delight in beholding the fair bodies so sorelydesired, and hearkening the soft wheedling of longed-for voices.There were the cups of friends beneath the chestnut trees, and thetalk of the deeds of the fighting-men, and of the heavy days of thehome-abiders; many a tale told oft and o'er again.  There was thesinging of old songs and of new, and the beholding the well-lovednook of the pleasant places, which death might well have made noughtfor them; and they were sweet with the fear of that which was past,and in their pleasantness was fresh promise for the days to come.So amid their joyance came evening and nightfall; and though folkwere weary with the fulness of delight, yet now for many theirweariness led them to the chamber of love before the rest of deepnight came to them to make them strong for the happy life to be begunagain on the morrow.House by house they feasted, and few were the lovers that sat nottogether that even.  But Face-of-god and the Sun-beam parted at thedoor of the House of the Face; for needs must she go with her newfolk to the House of the Steer, and needs must Face-of-god be amongsthis own folk in that hour of high-tide, and sit beside his fatherbeneath the image of the God with the ray-begirt head.CHAPTER LVIII.  HOW THE MAIDEN WARD WAS HELD IN BURGDALENow May was well worn when the Host came home to Burgdale; and on thevery morrow of men's home-coming they began to talk eagerly of theMidsummer Weddings, and how the Maiden Ward would be the greatest andfairest of all yet seen, whereas battle and the deliverance frombattle stir up the longing and love both of men and maidens; muchalso men spake of the wedding of Face-of-god and the Sun-beam; andneeds must their wedding abide to the time of the Maiden Ward atMidsummer, and needs also must the Sun-beam go on the Ward with theother Brides of the Folk.  So then must Face-of-god keep his soul inpatience till those few days were over, doing what work came to hand;and he held his head high among the people, and was well looked to ofevery man.In all matters the Sun-beam helped him, both in doing and inforbearing; and now so wonderful and rare was her beauty, that folklooked on her with somewhat of fear, as though she came from the veryfolk of the Gods.Indeed she seemed somewhat changed from what she had been of late;she was sober of demeanour during these last days of her maidenhood,and sat amongst the kindred as one communing with herself:  of fewwords she was and little laughter; but her face clear, not overcastby any gloom or shaken by passion:  soft and kind was she in conversewith others, and sweet were the smiles that came into her face ifothers' faces seemed to crave for them.  For it must be said that assome folk eat out their hearts with fear of the coming evils, even sowas she feeding her soul with the joy of the days to be, whatevertrouble might fall upon them, whereof belike she foreboded some.So wore the days toward Midsummer, when the wheat was getting pastthe blossoming, and the grass in the mown fields was growing deepgreen again after the shearing of the scythe; when the leaves weremost and biggest; when the roses were beginning to fall; when theapples were reddening, and the skins of the grape-berries gatheringbloom.  High aloft floated the light clouds over the Dale; deep blueshowed the distant fells below the ice-mountains; the watersdwindled; all things sought the shadow by daytime, and the twilightof even and the twilight of dawn were but sundered by three hours ofhalf-dark night.So in the bright forenoon were seventeen brides assembled in the Gateof Burgstead (but of the rest of the Dale were twenty and threelooked for), and with these was the Sun-beam, her face as calm as themountain lake under a summer sunset, while of the others many wererestless, and babbling like April throstles; and not a few talked toher eagerly, and in their restless love of her dragged her abouthither and thither.No men were to be seen that morning; for such was the custom, thatthe carles either departed to the fields and the acres, or abodewithin doors on the morn of the day of the Maiden Ward; but there wasa throng of women about the Gate and down the street of Burgstead,and it may well be deemed that they kept not silence that hour.So fared the Brides of Burgstead to the place of the Maiden Ward onthe causeway, whereto were come already the other brides from steadsup and down the Dale, or were even then close at hand on the way; andamong them were Long-coat and her two fellows, with whom Face-of-godhad held converse on that morning whereon he had followed his fate tothe Mountain.There then were they gathered under the cliff-wall of the Portway;and by the road-side had their grooms built them up bowers of greenboughs to shelter them from the sun's burning, which were thatchedwith bulrushes, and decked with garlands of the fairest flowers ofthe meadows and the gardens.Forsooth they were a lovely sight to look on, for no fairer womenmight be seen in the world; and the eldest of them was scant of fiveand twenty winters.  Every maiden was clad in as goodly raiment asshe might compass; their sleeves and gown-hems and girdles, yea,their very shoes and sandals were embroidered so fairly and closely,that as they shifted in the sun they changed colour like the king-fisher shooting from shadow to sunshine.  According to due customevery maiden bore some weapon.  A few had bows in their hands andquivers at their backs; some had nought but a sword girt to theirsides; some bore slender-shafted spears, so as not to overburdentheir shapely hands; but to some it seemed a merry game to carry longand heavy thrust-spears, or to bear great war-axes over theirshoulders.  Most had their flowing hair coifed with bright helms;some had burdened their arms with shields; some bore steel hauberksover their linen smocks:  almost all had some piece of war-gear ontheir bodies; and one, to wit, Steed-linden of the Sickle, a tall andfair damsel, was so arrayed that no garment could be seen on her butbright steel war-gear.As for the Sun-beam, she was clad in a white kirtle embroidered fromthroat to hem with work of green boughs and flowers of the goodliestfashion, and a garland of roses on her head.  Dale-warden himself wasgirt to her side by a girdle fair-wrought of golden wire, and shebore no other weapon or war-gear; and she let him lie quiet in hisscabbard, nor touched the hilts once; whereas some of the otherdamsels would be ever drawing their swords out and thrusting themback.  But all noted that goodly weapon, the yoke-fellow of so manygreat deeds.There then on the Portway, between the water and the rock-wall, roseup plenteous and gleeful talk of clear voices shrill and soft; andwhiles the maidens sang, and whiles they told tales of old days, andwhiles they joined hands and danced together on the sweet summer dustof the highway.  Then they mostly grew aweary, and sat down on thebanks of the road or under their leafy bowers.Noon came, and therewithal goodwives of the neighbouring Dale, whobrought them meat and drink, and fruit and fresh flowers from theteeming gardens; and thereafter for a while they nursed their joy intheir bosoms, and spake but little and softly while the day was atits hottest in the early afternoon.Then came out of Burgstead men making semblance of chapmen with awain bearing wares, and they made as though they were wending downthe Portway westward to go out of the Dale.  Then arose the weaponedmaidens and barred the way to them, and turned them back amidstfresh-springing merriment.Again in a while, when the sun was westering and the shadows growinglong, came herdsmen from down the Dale driving neat, and making asthough they would pass by into Burgstead, but to them also did themaidens gainsay the road, so that needs must they turn back amidstlaughter and mockery, they themselves also laughing and mocking.And so at last, when the maidens had been all alone a while, and itwas now hard on sunset, they drew together and stood in a ring, andfell to singing; and one Gold-may of the House of the Bridge, a mostsweet singer, stood amidst their ring and led them.  And this issomewhat of the meaning of their words:The sun will not tarry; now changeth the light,Fail the colours that marry the Day to the Night.Amid the sun's burning bright weapons we bore,For this eve of our earning comes once and no more.For to-day hath no brother in yesterday's tide,And to-morrow no other alike it doth hide.This day is the token of oath and behestThat ne'er shall be broken through ill days and best.Here the troth hath been given, the oath hath been done,To the Folk that hath thriven well under the sun.And the gifts of its giving our troth-day shall winAre the Dale for our living and dear days therein.O Sun, now thou wanest! yet come back and seeAmidst all that thou gainest how gainful are we.O witness of sorrow wide over the earth,Rise up on the morrow to look on our mirth!Thy blooms art thou bringing back ever for men,And thy birds are a-singing each summer again.But to men little-hearted what winter is worseThan thy summers departed that bore them the curse?And e'en such art thou knowing where thriveth the year,And good is all growing save thralldom and fear.Nought such be our lovers' hearts drawing anigh,While yet thy light hovers aloft in the sky.Lo the seeker, the finder of Death in the Blade!What lips shall be kinder on lips of mine laid?La he that hath driven back tribes of the South!Sweet-breathed is thine even, but sweeter his mouth.Come back from the sea then, O sun! come aback,Look adown, look on me then, and ask what I lack!Come many a morrow to gaze on the Dale,And if e'er thou seest sorrow remember its tale!For 'twill be of a story to tell how men diedIn the garnering of glory that no man may hide.O sun sinking under!  O fragrance of earth!O heart!  O the wonder whence longing has birth!So they sang, and the sun sank indeed; and amidst their singing theeve was still about them, though there came a happy murmur from theface of the meadows and the houses of the Thorp aloof.  But as theirsong fell they heard the sound of footsteps a many on the road; sothey turned and stood with beating hearts in such order as when aband of the valiant draw together to meet many foes coming on themfrom all sides, and they stand back to back to face all comers.  Andeven therewith, their raiment gleaming amidst the gathering dusk,came on them the young men of the Dale newly delivered from the griefof war.Then in very deed the fierce mouths of the raisers of the war-shoutwere kind on the faces of tender maidens.  Then went spear and axeand helm and shield clattering to the earth, as the arms of the new-comers went round about the bodies of the Brides, weary with the longday of sunshine, and glee and loving speech, and the maidens sufferedthe young men to lead them whither they would, and twilight began todraw round about them as the Maiden Band was sundered.Some, they were led away westward down the Portway to the homesteadsthereabout; and for divers of these the way was long to their halls,and they would have to wend over long stretches of dewy meadows, andhear the night-wind whisper in many a tree, and see the east begin tolighten with the dawn before they came to the lighted feast thatawaited them.  But some turned up the Portway straight towardsBurgstead; and short was their road to the halls where even now thelights were being kindled for their greeting.As for the Sun-beam, she had been very quiet the day long, speakingas little as she might do, laughing not at all, and smiling forkindness' sake rather than for merriment; and when the grooms cameseeking their maidens, she withdrew herself from the band, and stoodalone amidst the road nigher to Burgstead than they; and her heartbeat hard, and her breath came short and quick, as though fear hadcaught her in its grip; and indeed for one moment of time she fearedthat he was not coming to her.  For he had gone with the other groomsto that gathered band, and had passed from one to the other, notfinding her, till he had got him through the whole company, andbeheld her awaiting him.  Then indeed he bounded toward her, andcaught her by the hands, and then by the shoulders, and drew her tohim, and she nothing loth; and in that while he said to her:'Come then, my friend; lo thou! they go each their own way toward thehalls of their houses; and for thee have I chosen a way--a way overthe foot-bridge yonder, and over the dewy meadows on this best evenof the year.''Nay, nay,' she said, 'it may not be.  Surely the Burgstead groomslook to thee to lead them to the gate; and surely in the House of theFace they look to see thee before any other.  Nay, Gold-mane, mydear, we must needs go by the Portway.'He said:  'We shall be home but a very little while after the first,for the way I tell of is as short as the Portway.  But hearken, mysweet!  When we are in the meadows we shall sit down for a minute ona bank under the chestnut trees, and thence watch the moon coming upover the southern cliffs.  And I shall behold thee in the summernight, and deem that I see all thy beauty; which yet shall make medumb with wonder when I see it indeed in the house amongst thecandles.''O nay,' she said, 'by the Portway shall we go; the torch-bearersshall be abiding thee at the gate.'Spake Face-of-god:  'Then shall we rise up and wend first through awide treeless meadow, wherein amidst the night we shall behold thekine moving about like odorous shadows; and through the greyness ofthe moonlight thou shalt deem that thou seest the pink colour of theeglantine blossoms, so fragrant they are.''O nay,' she said, 'but it is meet that we go by the Portway.'But he said:  'Then from the wide meadow come we into a close ofcorn, and then into an orchard-close beyond it.  There in the ancientwalnut-tree the owl sitteth breathing hard in the night-time; butthou shalt not hear him for the joy of the nightingales singing fromthe apple-trees of the close.  Then from out of the shadowed orchardshall we come into the open town-meadow, and over its daisies shallthe moonlight be lying in a grey flood of brightness.'Short is the way across it to the brim of the Weltering Water, andacross the water lieth the fair garden of the Face; and I have dightfor thee there a little boat to waft us across the night-dark waters,that shall be like wavering flames of white fire where the moonsmites them, and like the void of all things where the shadows hangover them.  There then shall we be in the garden, beholding how thehall-windows are yellow, and hearkening the sound of the hall-gleeborne across the flowers and blending with the voice of thenightingales in the trees.  There then shall we go along the grasspaths whereby the pinks and the cloves and the lavender are sendingforth their fragrance, to cheer us, who faint at the scent of theover-worn roses, and the honey-sweetness of the lilies.'All this is for thee, and for nought but for thee this even; andmany a blossom whereof thou knowest nought shall grieve if thy foottread not thereby to-night; if the path of thy wedding which I havemade, be void of thee, on the even of the Chamber of Love.'But lo! at last at the garden's end is the yew-walk arched over forthee, and thou canst not see whereby to enter it; but I, I know it,and I lead thee into and along the dark tunnel through the moonlight,and thine hand is not weary of mine as we go.  But at the end shallwe come to a wicket, which shall bring us out by the gable-end of theHall of the Face.  Turn we about its corner then, and there are weblinking on the torches of the torch-bearers, and the candles throughthe open door, and the hall ablaze with light and full of joyousclamour, like the bale-fire in the dark night kindled on a ness abovethe sea by fisher-folk remembering the Gods.''O nay,' she said, 'but by the Portway must we go; the straightestway to the Gate of Burgstead.'In vain she spake, and knew not what she said; for even as he wasspeaking he led her away, and her feet went as her will went, ratherthan her words; and even as she said that last word she set her footon the first board of the foot-bridge; and she turned aback onemoment, and saw the long line of the rock-wall yet glowing with thelast of the sunset of midsummer, while as she turned again, lo!before her the moon just beginning to lift himself above the edge ofthe southern cliffs, and betwixt her and him all Burgdale, and Face-of-god moreover.Thus then they crossed the bridge into the green meadows, and throughthe closes and into the garden of the Face and unto the Hall-door;and other brides and grooms were there before them (for six groomshad brought home brides to the House of the Face); but none deemed itamiss in the War-leader of the folk and the love that had led him.And old Stone-face said:  'Too many are the rows of bee-skeps in thegardens of the Dale that we should begrudge wayward lovers an hour'swaste of candle-light.'So at last those twain went up the sun-bright Hall hand in hand inall their loveliness, and up on to the dais, and stood together bythe middle seat; and the tumult of the joy of the kindred was hushedfor a while as they saw that there was speech in the mouth of theWar-leader.Then he spread his hands abroad before them all and cried out:  'Howthen have I kept mine oath, whereas I swore on the Holy Boar to wedthe fairest woman of the world?'A mighty shout went rattling about the timbers of the roof in answerto his word; and they that looked up to the gable of the Hall saidthat they saw the ray-ringed image of the God smile with joy over thegathered folk.But spake Iron-face unheard amidst the clamour of the Hall:  'Howfares it now with my darling and my daughter, who dwelleth amongststrangers in the land beyond the wild-wood?'CHAPTER LIX.  THE BEHEST OF FACE-OF-GOD TO THE BRIDE ACCOMPLISHED:  AMOTE-STEAD APPOINTED FOR THE THREE FOLKS, TO WIT, THE MEN OFBURGDALE, THE SHEPHERDS, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE WOLFThree years and two months thereafter, three hours after noon in thedays of early autumn, came a wain tilted over with precious webs ofcloth, and drawn by eight white oxen, into the Market-place ofSilver-stead:  two score and ten of spearmen of the tallest, clad ingoodly war-gear, went beside it, and much people of Silver-dalethronged about them.  The wain stayed at the foot of the stair thatled up to the door of the Mote-house, and there lighted downtherefrom a woman goodly of fashion, with wide grey eyes, and faceand hands brown with the sun's burning.  She had a helm on her headand a sword girt to her side, and in her arms she bore a yearlingchild.And there was come Bow-may with the second man-child born to Face-of-god.She stayed not amidst the wondering folk, but hastened up the stair,which she had once seen running with the blood of men:  the door wasopen, and she went in and walked straight-way, with the babe in herarms, up the great Hall to the dais.There were men on the dais:  amidmost sat Folk-might, little changedsince the last day she had seen him, yet fairer, she deemed, than ofold time; and her heart went forth to meet the Chieftain of her Folk,and the glad tears started in her eyes and ran down her cheeks as shedrew near to him.By his side sat the Bride, and her also Bow-may deemed to have waxedgoodlier.  Both she and Folk-might knew Bow-may ere she had gone halfthe length of the hall; and the Bride rose up in her place and criedout Bow-may's name joyously.With these were sitting the elders of the Wolf and the Woodlanders,the more part of whom Bow-may knew well.On the dais also stood aside a score of men weaponed, and looking asif they were awaiting the word which should send them forth on someerrand.Now stood up Folk-might and said:  'Fair greeting and love to myfriend and the daughter of my Folk!  How farest thou, Bow-may, bestof all friendly women?  How fareth my sister, and Face-of-god mybrother? and how is it with our friends and helpers in the goodlyDale?'Said Bow-may:  'It is well both with all those and with me; and myheart laughs to see thee, Folk-might, and to look on the elders ofthe valiant, and our lovely sister the Bride.  But I have a messagefor thee from Face-of-god:  wilt thou that I deliver it here?''Yea surely,' said Folk-might, and came forth. and took her hand, andkissed her cheeks and her mouth.  The Bride also came forth and casther arms about her, and kissed her; and they led her between them toa seat on the dais beside Folk-might.But all men looked on the child in her arms and wondered what it was.But Bow-may took the babe, which was both fair and great, and set iton the knees of the Bride, and said:'Thus saith Face-of-god:  "Friend and kinswoman, well-belovedplaymate, the gift which thou badest of me in sorrow do thou now takein joy, and do all the good thou wouldest to the son of thy friend.The ring which I gave thee once in the garden of the Face, give thouto Bow-may, my trusty and well-beloved, in token of the fulfilment ofmy behest."'Then the Bride kissed Bow-may again, and fell to fondling of thechild, which was loth to leave Bow-may.But she spake again:  'To thee also, Folk-might, I have a messagefrom Face-of-god, who saith:  "Mighty warrior, friend and fellow, allthings thrive with us, and we are happy.  Yet is there a hollow placein our hearts which grieveth us, and only thou and thine may amendit.  Though whiles we hear tell of thee, yet we see thee not, andfain were we, might we see thee, and wot if the said tales be true.Wilt thou help us somewhat herein, or wilt thou leave us all thelabour?  For sure we be that thou wilt not say that thou rememberestus no more, and that thy love for us is departed."  This is hismessage, Folk-might, and he would have an answer from thee.'Then laughed Folk-might and said:  'Sister Bow-may, seest thou theseweaponed men hereby?''Yea,' she said.Said he:  'These men bear a message with them to Face-of-god mybrother.  Crow the Shaft-speeder, stand forth and tell thy friendBow-may the message I have set in thy mouth, every word of it.'Then Crow stood forth and greeted Bow-may friendly, and said:'Friend Bow-may, this is the message of our Alderman:  "Friend andhelper, in the Dale which thou hast given to us do all things thrive;neither are we grown old in three years' wearing, nor are ourmemories worsened.  We long sore to see you and give you guesting inSilver-dale, and one day that shall befall.  Meanwhile, know this:that we of the Wolf and the Woodland, mindful of the earth that boreus, and the pit whence we were digged, have a mind to go see ShadowyVale once in every three years, and there to hold high-tide in theancient Hall of the Wolf, and sit in the Doom-ring of our Fathers.But since ye have joined yourselves to us in battle, and have givenus this Dale, our health and wealth, without price and withoutreward, we deem you our very brethren, and small shall be our hall-glee, and barren shall our Doom-ring seem to us, unless ye sit therebeside us.  Come then, that we may rejoice each other by the sight offace and sound of voice; that we may speak together of matters thatconcern our welfare; so that we three Kindreds may become one Folk.And if this seem good to you, know that we shall be in Shadowy Valein a half-month's wearing.  Grieve us not by forbearing to come."Lo, Bow-may, this is the message, and I have learned it well, forwell it pleaseth me to bear it.'Then said Folk-might:  'What say'st thou to the message, Bow-may?''It is good in all ways,' said she, 'but is it timely?  May our folkhave the message and get to Shadowy Vale, so as to meet you there?''Yea surely,' said Folk-might, 'for our kinsmen here shall take theroad through Shadowy Vale, and in four days' time they shall be inBurgdale, and as thou wottest, it is scant a two days' journey thenceto Shadowy Vale.'Therewith he turned to those men again, and said:  'Kinsman Crow,depart now, and use all diligence with thy message.'So the messengers began to stir; but Bow-may cried out:  'Ho!  Folk-might, my friend, I perceive thou art little changed from the man Iknew in Shadowy Vale, who would have his dinner before the fowl wereplucked.  For shall I not go back with these thy messengers, so thatI also may get all ready to wend to the Mote-house of Shadowy Vale?'But the Bride looked kindly on her, and laughed and said:  'SisterBow-may, his meaning is that thou shouldest abide here in Silver-daletill we depart for the Folk-thing, and then go thither with us; andthis I also pray thee to do, that thou mayst rejoice the hearts ofthine old friends; and also that thou mayst teach me all that Ishould know concerning this fair child of my brother and my sister.'And she looked on her so kindly as she caressed the babe, that Bow-may's heart melted, and she cried out:'Would that I might never depart from the house wherein thoudwellest, O Bride of my Kinsman!  And this that thou biddest me iseasy and pleasant for me to do.  But afterwards I must get me back toBurgdale; for I seem to have left much there that calleth for me.''Yea,' said Folk-might, 'and art thou wedded, Bow-may?  Shalt thounever bend the yew in battle again?'Said Bow-may soberly:  'Who knoweth, chieftain?  Yea, I am wedded nowthese two years; and nought I looked for less when I followed thosetwain through the wild-wood to Burgdale.'She sighed therewith, and said:  'In all the Dale there is no betterman of his hands than my man, nor any goodlier to look on, and he iseven that Hart of Highcliff whom thou knowest well, O Bride!'Said the Bride:  'Thou sayest sooth, there is no better man in theDale.'Said Bow-may:  'Sun-beam bade me wed him when he pressed hard uponme.'  She stayed awhile, and then said:  'Face-of-god also deemed Ishould not naysay the man; and now my son by him is of like age tothis little one.''Good is thy story,' said Folk-might; 'or deemest thou, Bow-may, thatsuch strong and goodly women as thou, and women so kind and friendly,should forbear the wedding and the bringing forth of children?  Yea,and we who may even yet have to gather to another field before wedie, and fight for life and the goods of life.''Thou sayest well,' she said; 'all that hath befallen me is goodsince the day whereon I loosed shaft from the break of the bent overyonder.'Therewith she fell a-musing, and made as though she were hearkeningto the soft voice of the Bride caressing the new-come baby; but insooth neither heard nor saw what was going on about her, for herthoughts were in bygone days.  Howbeit presently she came to herselfagain, and fell to asking many questions concerning Silver-dale andthe kindred, and those who had once been thralls of the Dusky Men;and they answered all duly, and told her the whole story of the Dalesince the Day of the Victory.So Bow-may and the carles who had come with her abode for that half-month in Silver-dale, guested in all love by the folk thereof, boththe kindreds and the poor folk.  And Bow-may deemed that the Brideloved Face-of-god's child little less than her own, whereof she hadtwo, a man and a woman; and thereat was she full of joy, since sheknew that Face-of-god and the Sun-beam would be fain thereof.Thereafter, when the time was come, fared Folk-might and the Bride,and many of the elders and warriors of the Wolf and the Woodland, toShadowy Vale; and Dallach and the best of Rose-dale went with them,being so bidden; and Bow-may and her following, according to the wordof the Bride.  And in Shadowy Vale they met Face-of-god and AldermanIron-face, and the chiefs of Burgdale and the Shepherds, and manyothers; and great joy there was at the meeting.  And the Sun-beamremembered the word which she spoke to Face-of-god when first he cameto Shadowy Vale, that she would be wishful to see again the dwellingwherein she had passed through so much joy and sorrow of her youngerdays.  But if anyone were fain of this meeting, the Alderman was gladabove all, when he took the Bride once more in his arms, and caressedher whom he had deemed should be a very daughter of his House.Now telleth the tale of all these kindreds, to wit, the Men ofBurgdale and the Sheepcotes; and the Children of the Wolf, and theWoodlanders, and the Men of Rose-dale, that they were friendshenceforth, and became as one Folk, for better or worse, in peace andin war, in waning and waxing; and that whatsoever befell them, theyever held Shadowy Vale a holy place, and for long and long after theymet there in mid-autumn, and held converse and counsel together.NO MORE AS NOW TELLETH THE TALE OF THESE KINDREDS AND FOLKS, BUTMAKETH AN ENDING.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS ***This file should be named rtmt10.txt or rtmt10.zipCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, rtmt11.txtVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, rtmt10a.txtProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the USunless a copyright notice is included.

Kennedy in this eBook:  January 30, 1961  January 11, 1962  January 14, 1963***State of the Union AddressJohn F. KennedyJanuary 30, 1961Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress:It is a pleasure to return from whence I came. You are among my oldestfriends in Washington--and this House is my oldest home. It was here, morethan 14 years ago, that I first took the oath of Federal office. It washere, for 14 years, that I gained both knowledge and inspiration frommembers of both parties in both Houses--from your wise and generousleaders--and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall, sittingwhere you now sit--including the programs of two great Presidents, theundimmed eloquence of Churchill, the soaring idealism of Nehru, thesteadfast words of General de Gaulle. To speak from this same historicrostrum is a sobering experience. To be back among so many friends is ahappy one.I am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wiselyassigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; anda President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect willneither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold fromneither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, orfuture, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct andhazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to theCongress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.I speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity. Beforemy term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation organizedand governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no means certain.The answers are by no means clear. All of us together--this Administration,this Congress, this nation--must forge those answers.But today, were I to offer--after little more than a week inoffice--detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congresswould rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty ofresponsibility.My remarks, therefore, will be limited. But they will also be candid. Tostate the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past.The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies, and gives afaithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust. And,while the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings andassets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free anddetermined people, through its elected officials, to face all problemsfrankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear.                                   I.The present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the wakeof seven months of recession, three and one-half years of slack, sevenyears of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling farmincome.Business bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the GreatDepression. Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent.Save for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highestpeak in our history. Of some five and one-half million Americans who arewithout jobs, more than one million have been searching for work for morethan four months. And during each month some 150,000 workers are exhaustingtheir already meager jobless benefit rights.Nearly one-eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hopein nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas. The restinclude new school graduates unable to use their talents, farmers forced togive up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family budgets,skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries asmetals, machinery, automobiles and apparel.Our recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and incomplete.Our Gross National Product never regained its full potential. Unemploymentnever returned to normal levels. Maximum use of our national industrialcapacity was never restored.In short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourcefulindustrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate ofeconomic growth. Since last spring our economic growth rate has actuallyreceded. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen belowpredicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are ininventory. Fewer people are working--and the average work week has shrunkwell below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise--so that now toomany Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy.Economic prophecy is at best an uncertain art--as demonstrated by theprediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and Iquote, "the most prosperous year in our history." Nevertheless, forecastsof continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and1962 have been made with alarming unanimity--and this Administration doesnot intend to stand helplessly by.We cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting theend of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can do--toreduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur newproductivity, and to foster higher economic growth within a range of soundfiscal policies and relative price stability.I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improveunemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on aself-supporting basis--to provide more food for the families of theunemployed, and to aid their needy children--to redevelop our areas ofchronic labor surplus--to expand the services of the U.S. EmploymentOffices--to stimulate housing and construction--to secure more purchasingpower for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimumwage--to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment--to increase thedevelopment of our natural resources--to encourage price stability--and totake other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way forincreased long-range growth. This is not a partisan program concentratingon our weaknesses--it is, I hope, a national program to realize ournational strength.                                  II.Efficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology thatcan make our goods more competitive, is also the key to the internationalbalance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist talk and panickysolutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective.It is true that, since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend orinvest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened.This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11billion in the 3 years--and holders of dollars abroad converted themto gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5billion of gold from our reserve. The 1959 deficit was caused in largepart by the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets--theresult both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitiveprices. The 1960 deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of anincrease in private capital outflow seeking new opportunity, higherreturn or speculative advantage abroad.Meanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of theWest's military and foreign aid obligations. Under existing policies,another deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961--and individuals inthose countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits forimprovement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remainsufficient to meet our own obligations.All this is cause for concern--but it is not cause for panic. For ourmonetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including ourdrawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve heldas backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits, we have some $22billion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reservesavailable--and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind thevalue of the dollar for use if needed.Moreover, we hold large assets abroad--the total owed this nation farexceeds the claims upon our reserves--and our exports once againsubstantially exceed our imports.In short, we need not--and we shall not--take any action to increase thedollar price of gold from $35 an ounce--to impose exchange controls--toreduce our anti-recession efforts--to fall back on restrictive tradepolicies--or to weaken our commitments around the world.This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in anyfashion. And this is a commitment.Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken toease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in worldaffairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability topay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperativeefforts with our allies will get underway immediately--aimed at attractingforeign investment and travel to this country--promoting American exports,at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees andfinancing--curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spendingof private dollars abroad--and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharingwith our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the freeworld and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While thecurrent deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroadwithout placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have askedto serve our Flag overseas.In short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our effortsabroad, and to make certain that, in the future as in the past, the dollaris as "sound as a dollar."                                 III.But more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance.The current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show anet deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain inbalance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested--andonly if an earlier and sharper up-turn in the economy than my economicadvisers now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated.Nevertheless, a new Administration must of necessity build on the spendingand revenue estimates already submitted. Within that framework, barring thedevelopment of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy,it is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which,including revenues from a stimulation of the economy, will not of and bythemselves unbalance the earlier Budget.However, we will do what must be done. For our national household iscluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks. Our cities are beingengulfed in squalor. Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal tobe "a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family," westill have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes. A new housingprogram under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be neededthis year.Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly haveroom for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. Onethird of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable tocontinue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's,who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 uponour colleges--with two college students for every one, ten years fromnow--and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, theengineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglectedoceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies atthe root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public schooleducation can no longer be delayed.Medical research has achieved new wonders--but these wonders are too oftenbeyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income(particularly among the aged), a lack of hospital beds, a lack of nursinghomes and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide health carefor the aged under Social Security, and to increase the supply of bothfacilities and personnel, must be undertaken this year.Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes costthe taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that wehave improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial ofconstitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account ofrace--at the ballot box and elsewhere--disturbs the national conscience,and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is notequal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private businesshas not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A hostof problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to includein this Message, deserves--and will receive--the attention of both theCongress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages willbe sent to the Congress within the next two weeks.                                  IV.But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront usaround the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of hisparty, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to bestaggered upon learning--even in this brief 10 day period--the harshenormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years.Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult.Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread andhostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that ouranalyses over the last ten days make it clear that--in each of theprincipal areas of crisis--the tide of events has been running out and timehas not been our friend.In Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace thesecurity of the entire area--from the borders of India and South Viet Namto the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly-won independence.We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and, indeed, in all of theworld--freedom for the people and independence for the government. And thisNation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives.In Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, politicalunrest and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroicefforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order--efforts whichare now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and decreasingsupport from many member states.In Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region'speaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 milesfrom our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive fora better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestictyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questionsof economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communistdomination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated.We are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas ofall such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of afree hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the ArcticCircle.In Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray. The unity ofNATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by nationalinterest. It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved acommon outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutualproblems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary reserves, and ahost of other areas; and our close ties with those whose hopes andinterests we share are among this Nation's most powerful assets.Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the ColdWar--but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the SovietUnion and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing thateither power has yielded its ambitions for world domination--ambitionswhich they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, ourtask is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not beprofitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition--forprestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds--issomething else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete forman's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with everincreasing confidence.To meet this array of challenges--to fulfill the role we cannot avoid onthe world scene--we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tools:military, economic and political.One must not overshadow the other. On the Presidential Coat of Arms, theAmerican eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his lefthe holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both.First, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a periodof uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military anddiplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as to makeany aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a consistent,coherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions about ournational requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication arising frominter-service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately howadequate--or inadequate--our defenses really are.I have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise ourentire defense strategy--our ability to fulfill our commitments--theeffectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic bases, forcesand warning systems--the efficiency and economy of our operation andorganization--the elimination of obsolete bases and installations--and theadequacy, modernization and mobility of our present conventional andnuclear forces and weapons systems in the light of present and futuredangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end ofFebruary--and I then shall recommend whatever legislative, budgetary orexecutive action is needed in the light of these conclusions.In the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediatelythree new steps most clearly needed now:First, I have directed prompt attention to increase our air-lift capacity.Obtaining additional air transport mobility--and obtaining it now--willbetter assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond, withdiscrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at anymoment's notice. In particular it will enable us to meet any deliberateeffort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widelyscattered parts of the globe.(b) I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program.Using unobligated ship-building funds now (to let contracts originallyscheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station--atleast nine months earlier than planned--substantially more units of acrucial deterrent--a fleet that will never attack first, but possesssufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourageany aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.(c) I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program.Until the Secretary of Defense's reappraisal is completed, the emphasishere will be largely on improved organization and decision-making--oncutting down the wasteful duplications and the time-lag that havehandicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are to keep the peace, weneed an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressorfrom even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enoughof our force to prevent his own destruction. For as I said upon taking theoath of office: "Only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we becertain beyond doubt that they will never be employed."Secondly, we must improve our economic tools. Our role is essential andunavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for theentire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength tomeet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations--to surmounttheir own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering andunprecedented--the response must be towering and unprecedented as well,much as Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, whichbrought such fruitful results.(a) I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and moreeffective program for assisting the economic, educational and socialdevelopment of other countries and continents. That program must stimulateand take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies, andprovide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so oftenoverlap, conflict or diffuse our energies and resources. Such a program,compared to past programs, will require--more flexibility for short run emergencies--more commitment to long term development--new attention to education atall levels--greater emphasis on the recipient nation's role, their effort,their purpose, with greater social justice for their people, broaderdistribution and participation by their people and more efficient publicadministration and more efficient tax systems of their own--and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of apiecemeal approach.I hope the Senate will take early action approving the Conventionestablishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies thisdevelopment effort--working toward the time when each nation willcontribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For, while we are preparedto assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and must not beexpected to bear them alone.To our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance forprogress--alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous LatinAmerica, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree ofeconomic and social progress that matches their historic contributions ofculture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time inthat alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:--That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged bythe Act of Bogota, to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but asa first step in the sound development of the Americas.--That a new Inter-Departmental Task Force be established under theleadership of the Department of State, to coordinate at the highest levelall policies and programs of concern to the Americas.--That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members,strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to preventforeign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.--That, in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemisphericattack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to alllevels; and, finally,--That a Food-for-Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America toexplore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help endhunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our ownhemisphere.This Administration is expanding its Food-for-Peace Program in everypossible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively torelieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe. And Ihave asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional ways inwhich these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace--includingthe establishment of world food reserves.An even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men andwomen--not only on our college campuses but in every age group--who haveindicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts, and apart of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize thistalent through the formation of a National Peace Corps, enlisting theservices of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign landsmeet their urgent needs for trained personnel.Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non-communist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedomand welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared tohelp re-establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congressfor increased discretion to use economic tools in this area wheneverthis is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will requireamendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines Iproposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted lastsummer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government thepossibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace thatwill demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the peopleof Poland.Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools--the means ofcooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order mustultimately rest.I have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmamenteffort--to increase our programs of research and study--and to make armscontrol a central goal of our national policy under my direction. Thedeadly arms race, and the huge resources it absorbs, have too longovershadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms race fromspreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of outerspace. We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed andbetter prepared--to formulate workable proposals of our own and to makesound judgments about the proposals of others.I have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delayin the talks on a nuclear test ban--and it is our intention to resumenegotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that isequally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty.We must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to endthe Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In recognition ofits increasing importance and the doubling of its membership--we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the U.N.--we shall help insure that it is properly financed.--we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of theSecretary-General is maintained.--And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of theworld--to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is farmore essential to their security than it is to ours--the only body in theworld where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation hasan equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according tothe strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. Itdeserves the support of all.Finally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areasof cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations "to invoke thewonders of science instead of its terrors." Specifically, I now invite allnations--including the Soviet Union--to join with us in developing aweather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program andin preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probeswhich may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, whilethe Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles intoorbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations byremoving these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of theCold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Unionand the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruitsof this new knowledge available to all--and, beyond that, in an effort toextend farm technology to hungry nations--to wipe out disease--to increasethe exchanges of scientists and their knowledge--and to make our ownlaboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack thefacilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies ofus all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible evenwith those with whom we most deeply disagree--and this must someday be thebasis of world peace and world law.                                   V.I have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance ofpayments, our Federal and social budget and the state of the world. I wouldlike to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executivebranch. We have found it full of honest and useful public servants--buttheir capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has toooften been muffled in the morass of committees, timidities and fictitioustheories which have created a growing gap between decision and execution,between planning and reality. In a time of rapidly deteriorating situationsat home and abroad, this is bad for the public service and particularly badfor the country; and we mean to make a change.I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuousencouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving thepublic interest. Let every public servant know, whether his post is high orlow, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will bedetermined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of hisstaff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this Administrationrecognizes the value of dissent and daring--that we greet healthycontroversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be aproud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any areaof our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to saywith pride and with honor in future years: "I served the United Statesgovernment in that hour of our nation's need."For only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can webring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our problemsare critical. The tide is unfavorable. The news will be worse before it isbetter. And while hoping and working for the best, we should prepareourselves now for the worst.We cannot escape our dangers--neither must we let them drive us into panicor narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of poweralready rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharplydivided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of aharsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardorin its servants--while the blessings of liberty have too often stood forprivilege, materialism and a life of ease.But I have a different view of liberty.Life in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking forit, will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the tide isturned. But turn it we must. The hopes of all mankind rest upon us--notsimply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in Laos, thefisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that moves every manand Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future. And in thefinal analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance ofour fellow citizens of the great Republic.In the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closinghis final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, "We pray that wemay be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us."***State of the Union AddressJohn F. KennedyJanuary 11, 1962Mr. Vice President, my old colleague from Massachusetts and your newSpeaker, John McCormack, Members of the 87th Congress, ladies andgentlemen:This week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build theAmerican future. But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long pastwith the present and looked strongly to the future. "Mister Sam" Rayburn isgone. Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without him.Members of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power butpartners for progress. We are all trustees for the American people,custodians of the American heritage. It is my task to report the State ofthe Union--to improve it is the task of us all.In the past year, I have traveled not only across our own land but toother lands--to the North and the South, and across the seas. And I havefound--as I am sure you have, in your travels--that people everywhere,in spite of occasional disappointments, look to us--not to our wealth orpower, but to the splendor of our ideals. For our Nation is commissionedby history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause ofits success. Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfillthe world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.I. STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMYThat task must begin at home. For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals here,we cannot expect others to accept them. And when the youngest child alivetoday has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the world willbe determined first of all by what provisions we make today--for hiseducation, his health, and his opportunities for a good home and a goodjob and a good life.At home, we began the year in the valley of recession--we completed it onthe high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new Congressionallyapproved or Administratively increased stimulants to our economy, thenumber of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101 to 60;non-agricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; andthe average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year'send the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a "stumbling horse" wasracing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrialproduction.We are gratified--but we are not satisfied. Too many unemployed are stilllooking for the blessings of prosperity. As those who leave our schools andfarms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away. To expand our growthand job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three measures:(1) First, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste ofable-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has beenreplaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a mine;(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and placenot only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and outof work, but the twenty-six million young Americans entering the labormarket in this decade; and(3) Third, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery andequipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciationallowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability tocompete abroad.Moreover--pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery--let usnot forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7 years. Thetime to repair the roof is when the sun is shining--by filling three basicgaps in our anti-recession protection. We need:(1) First, Presidential stand-by authority, subject to Congressional veto,to adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified range andtime, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged us all down;(2) Second, Presidential stand-by authority, upon a given rise in the rateof unemployment, to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capitalimprovement programs; and(3) Third, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensationsystem--to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who cannotfind it, their purchasing power and their living standards without constantresort--as we have seen in recent years by the Congress and theAdministrations--to temporary supplements.If we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a freeeconomy need not be an unstable economy--that a free system need not leavemen unemployed--and that a free society is not only the most productive butthe most stable form of organization yet fashioned by man.II. FIGHTING INFLATIONBut recession is only one enemy of a free economy--inflation is another.Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices heldalmost steady--and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record ofoverall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the endof World War II.Inflation too often follows in the shadow of growth--while price stabilityis made easy by stagnation or controls. But we mean to maintain bothstability and growth in a climate of freedom.Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and publicspirit of business and labor--keeping their total increases in wages andprofits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test toguide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them--for theircountry's interest, and for their own--to apply the test of the publicinterest to these transactions.Within this same framework of growth and wage-price stability:--This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by wideningthe access of small business to credit and Government contracts, and bystepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing, and racketeering;--We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our classified,postal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable to those ofprivate industry;--We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the levelincurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,--I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget.This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation onappropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:(1) First, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit;(2) Second, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to removeunwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest thesame withholding requirements we have long applied to wages; and(3) Third, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates,except for those changes--which will be recommended in a message--affectingtransportation.III. GETTING AMERICA MOVINGBut a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget. Theyrequire progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify ourstrength.CITIESA strong America depends on its cities--America's glory, and sometimesAmerica's shame. To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress fordecay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs, andlaunched new ones--redoubled the attack on water pollution--speeded aid toairports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit systems--andsecured new weapons to combat organized crime, racketeering, and youthdelinquency, assisted by the coordinated and hard-hitting efforts of ourinvestigative services: the FBI, the Internal Revenue, the Bureau ofNarcotics, and many others. We shall need further anti-crime, mass transit,and transportation legislation--and new tools to fight air pollution. Andwith all this effort under way, both equity and common sense require thatour nation's urban areas--containing three-fourths of our population--sitas equals at the Cabinet table. I urge a new Department of Urban Affairsand Housing.AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCESA strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. Americanfarmers took heart in 1961--from a billion dollar rise in farm income--andfrom a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are stilloperating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt ruralpoverty or boost farm earnings.Our task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificentproductivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our owncountryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failuresof the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all. Since 1950 ouragricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled! Without new,realistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and our taxpayers ina national scandal or a farm depression.I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farmprogram--tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each cropto the long-range needs of the sixties--and designed to prevent chaos inthe sixties with a program of common sense.We also need for the sixties--if we are to bequeath our full nationalestate to our heirs--a new long-range conservation and recreationprogram--expansion of our superb national parks and forests--preservationof our authentic wilderness areas--new starts on water and power projectsas our population steadily increases--and expanded REA generation andtransmission loans.CIVIL RIGHTSBut America stands for progress in human rights as well as economicaffairs, and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equalrights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color. ThisAdministration has shown as never before how much could be done through thefull use of Executive powers--through the enforcement of laws alreadypassed by the Congress--through persuasion, negotiation, and litigation, tosecure the constitutional rights of all: the right to vote, the right totravel without hindrance across State lines, and the right to free publiceducation.I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equalemployment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The VicePresident's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary"Plans for Progress" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving aquiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional,supervisory, and other job opportunities.But there is much more to be done--by the Executive, by the courts, and bythe Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which theexecutive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods ofstrengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right tovote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrarydevices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and polltaxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of theEmancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of theGovernment--and every citizen--portray that "righteousness does exalt anation."HEALTH AND WELFAREFinally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of itscitizens--the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, theeducation of the young. For we are not developing the Nation's wealth forits own sake. Wealth is the means--and people are the ends. All ourmaterial riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand theopportunities of our people.Last year, we improved the diet of needy people--provided more hot lunchesand fresh milk to school children--built more college dormitories--and, forthe elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, health services, andsocial security. But we have just begun.To help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new publicwelfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitationinstead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolongeddependency.To relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists--and this is amatter which should concern us all--and expand research, I urge action toaid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish newNational Institutes of Health.To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a massimmunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancientenemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.To protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shallrecommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws--strengthening inspectionand standards, halting unsafe and worthless products, preventing misleadinglabels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of habit-forming drugs.But in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more importantor more urgent than the enactment under the social security system ofhealth insurance for the aged.For our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higherhospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them. Privatehealth insurance helps very few--for its cost is high and its coveragelimited. Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief buthard-pressed to pay their own bills. Nor can their children orgrandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet thisconstant drain.Social security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement, death,and disability. I now urge that its coverage be extended without furtherdelay to provide health insurance for the elderly.EDUCATIONEqually important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eightmillion adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This isa disturbing figure--reflected in Selective Service rejectionrates--reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommendplans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.I shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to stimulatethe arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans for theconstruction of academic facilities and Federally financed scholarships.If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able highschool graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yetnearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10years. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomicallevels--now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our familiesearn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs--but this Nationcannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent tothe Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public schoolconstruction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed theSenate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amountrequired by our needs and--in terms of across-the-board aid--the maximumscope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken orwithdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session."Civilization," said H. G. Wells, "is a race between education andcatastrophe." It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner ofthat race.These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievancesin our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and thefoundation of our hopes. "I believe in democracy," said Woodrow Wilson,"because it releases the energy of every human being." The dynamic ofdemocracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy ofthis administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realizehis own highest possibilities.Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productiveemployment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrationalexclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health andwelfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individualthe source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise ofAmerican life.IV. OUR GOALS ABROADAll of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since theclose of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormentedmankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard ofliving, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is ourbelief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.This basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping ourglobe--swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in theheadlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow. Both the successes andthe setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business.For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger--every area oftrouble gives out a ray of hope--and the one unchangeable certainty is thatnothing is certain or unchangeable.Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free andindependent states--free to choose their own future and their own system,so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.Some may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for ourselves--butit is not for us that they are choosing. We can welcome diversity--theCommunists cannot. For we offer a world of choice--they offer the world ofcoercion. And the way of the past shows clearly that freedom, not coercion,is the wave of the future. At times our goal has been obscured by crisis orendangered by conflict--but it draws sustenance from five basic sources ofstrength:--the moral and physical strength of the United States;--the united strength of the Atlantic Community;--the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations;--the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing nations;and--the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.V. OUR MILITARY STRENGTHOur moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed. But itincludes our military strength as well. So long as fanaticism and fearbrood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others fromaggression.In the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved. Weincreased the previous defense budget by 15 percent--not in the expectationof war but for the preservation of peace. We more than doubled ouracquisition rate of Polaris submarines--we doubled the production capacityfor Minuteman missiles--and increased by 50 percent the number of mannedbombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert. This year the combined forcelevels planned under our new Defense budget--including nearly three hundredadditional Polaris and Minuteman missiles--have been precisely calculatedto insure the continuing strength of our nuclear deterrent.But our strength may be tested at many levels. We intend to have at alltimes the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks--as acomplement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute. We have rejectedany all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but ingloriousretreat or unlimited retaliation.Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army'sstrategic reserve--increased our troops in Europe--built up theMarines--added new sealift and airlift capacity--modernized our weapons andammunition--expanded our anti-guerrilla forces--and increased the activefleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozenwings.Because we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness morequickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were activatedunder the Act of this Congress. Some disruptions and distress wereinevitable. But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens--and theirNation's burdens--with admirable and traditional devotion.In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised--two ArmyDivisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty--andsubstantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, theprocurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts.The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way,identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge yourapproval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall-outshelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.VI. THE UNITED NATIONSBut arms alone are not enough to keep the peace--it must be kept by men.Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations--and I see little meritin the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect worldinstrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles ofa world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself. Andif the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase. We maynot always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of theUnited Nations, or with every voting majority. But as an institution, itshould have in the future, as it has had in the past since its inception,no stronger or more faithful member than the United States of America.In 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika inthe seat of Hammarskjold--or Red China inside the Assembly--have seeninstead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independentSecretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament--for peace-keeping in outer space--for a decade of development effort--theUN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN withits gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos--or certain big-powerconfrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and toothers. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within aunited Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.No policeman is universally popular--particularly when he uses his stick torestore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing tocontribute their votes and their views--but very little else--have createda serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments.Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes--and a newUN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is tobe repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly inour interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all votingmembers to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of specialoperations has long been much higher than our share of the annualassessment--and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionateobligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve ourparticipation.With the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year agreat new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on themoon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first toParis. His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and othercountries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our objective inmaking this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on themoon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation,the position of the United States and the Free World.This Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the first--ifnot the first--we shall be. We are offering our know-how and ourcooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be providingother nations with improved weather observations. And I shall soon send tothe Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of anInternational Communications Satellite system, in a manner consistent withthe public interest and our foreign policy.But peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone. Worldorder will be secured only when the whole world has laid down these weaponswhich seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival ofthe human race. That armistice day seems very far away. The vast resourcesof this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying,instead of enriching, human life.But the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits hisexecution. Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands ofyears to surrender everything--including its existence--now. This Nationhas the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jamon disarmament and nuclear tests--and we will persist until we prevail,until the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force.VII. LATIN AMERICAI turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. TheAlliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal toprogram. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening ofhope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country--amongworkers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help inspeeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The LatinAmerican Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort ofself-help and self-reform.To support this historic undertaking, I am proposing--under the authoritycontained in the bills of the last session of the Congress--a speciallong-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion. Combined with our Foodfor Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this will provide morethan $1 billion a year in new support for the Alliance. In addition, wehave increased twelve-fold our Spanish and Portuguese language broadcastingin Latin America, and improved Hemispheric trade and defense. And whilethe blight of communism has been increasingly exposed and isolated in theAmericas, liberty has scored a gain. The people of the Dominican Republic,with our firm encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics ofthis Hemisphere, are safely passing through the treacherous course fromdictatorship through disorder towards democracy.VIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONSOur efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthentheir stand for freedom, have also made progress. A newly unified Agencyfor International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance toemphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic aidinstead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs of thenations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their ownresources.A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people infourteen countries--supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, togive these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of thebest that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that wecannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.A newly-expanded Food for Peace Program is feeding the hungry of manylands with the abundance of our productive farms--providing lunches forchildren in school, wages for economic development, relief for the victimsof flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily bread istheir chief concern.These programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom. Theviews of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours--butevents in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never towrite off any nation as lost to the Communists. That is the lesson of ourtime. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whosehistory, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside"entangling alliances"--as we did for more than a century. For theindependence of nations is a bar to the Communists' "grand design"--it isthe basis of our own.In the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independentLaos--regained there a common policy with our major allies--and insistedthat a cease-fire precede negotiations. While a workable formula forsupervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spreadof war--which might have involved this country also--and a Communistoccupation have thus far been prevented.A satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and safeguardthe peace in Viet-Nam--where the foe is increasing his tactics ofterror--where our own efforts have been stepped up--and where the localgovernment has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the base ofresistance. The systematic aggression now bleeding that country is not a"war of liberation"--for Viet-Nam is already free. It is a war of attemptedsubjugation--and it will be resisted.IX. THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITYFinally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished inthe last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number andthe readiness of its air, ground, and naval units--both its nuclear andnon-nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are stillrequired. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe,immeasurably strengthened.The threat to the brave city of Berlin remains. In these last 6 months theAllies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin, ourfree access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners wouldnot be surrendered either to force or through appeasement--and to maintainthose rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when appropriate,and to fight, if necessary. Every member of NATO stands with us in a commoncommitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free.I cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin. I canonly say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful andmutually acceptable resolution of this problem. I believe such a resolutioncan be found, and with it an improvement in our relations with the SovietUnion, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize the basic rightsand interests involved, and the interest of all mankind in peace.But the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely militaryaims. As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we are,and increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense, diplomacy, andmonetary affairs.The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of newties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation inhundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, ofdevelopment loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerteddiplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanicmountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from theaccumulating activity of all.Thus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity andcooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the verytime when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the IronCurtain. It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds ofinevitable disunity.X. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTSOn one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I amproud to give the Congress an encouraging report. Our efforts to safeguardthe dollar are progressing. In the 11 months preceding last February 1, wesuffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold. In the 11 months thatfollowed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars. And our deficit inour basic transactions with the rest of the world--trade, defense, foreignaid, and capital, excluding volatile short-term flows--has been reducedfrom $2 billion for 1960 to about one-third that amount for 1961.Speculative fever against the dollar is ending--and confidence in thedollar has been restored.We did not--and could not--achieve these gains through import restrictions,troop withdrawals, exchange controls, dollar devaluation or choking offdomestic recovery. We acted not in panic but in perspective. But theproblem is not yet solved. Persistently large deficits would endanger oureconomic growth and our military and defense commitments abroad. Our goalmust be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payments. With thecooperation of the Congress, business, labor, and our major allies, thatgoal can be reached.We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to ourshores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, tomaximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aidfrom other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws whichdo not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, andto urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies so as todiscourage large and disturbing capital movements.TRADEAbove all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand ourexports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive.Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants--our wage and pricegains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices--ourexport credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continueto expand.But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the EuropeanCommon Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there willarise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariffsimilar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we inthis country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns--orwill we wait until events have passed us by?This is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need anew law--a wholly new approach--a bold new instrument of American tradepolicy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course ofthe Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation tocome.If we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales totheir richest, fastest-growing market. Our exports will increase. Ourbalance of payments position will improve. And we will have forged acrossthe Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for freedom.If, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economicpressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies.Industries--and I believe this is most vital--industries will move theirplants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, andjobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannototherwise compete for its consumers. Our farm surpluses--our balance oftrade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products, isnearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the bestearners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and withoutentrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our farmsurpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South, and othercommodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15 years. Ourbalance of payments position will worsen. Our consumers will lack a widerchoice of goods at lower prices. And millions of American workers--whosejobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution ofexports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of ourcapital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained only in an expandingeconomy--these millions of workers in your home States and mine will seetheir real interests sacrificed.Members of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness bywaiting for others to lead. This Nation is the world's foremostmanufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter. The Common Market ismoving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours. The Communist economicoffensive is under way. The opportunity is ours--the initiative is up tous--and I believe that 1962 is the time.To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a newfive-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed withgreat care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh anyrisks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in theUnited States and in the Common Market on those items in which we togethersupply 80 percent of the world's trade--mostly items in which our ownability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, inthese items, substantially more than we import. This step will make itpossible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts inWestern Europe for access to European consumers.On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50percent--permitting bargaining by major categories--and provide forappropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjustingto import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided byperil points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor arewe abandoning our non-European friends or our traditional "most-favorednation" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragementfor their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to ourfriends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market,who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join withthem in overcoming.Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, notunilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unlessits outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity inour own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together weface a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free meneverywhere--to build in partnership a new trading community in which allfree nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitiveeffort.These various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to asingle goal--the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states.This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future--a freecommunity of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north andsouth, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing andtranscending the hates and fears that rend our age.We will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow. We may not reach it in ourown lifetime. But the quest is the greatest adventure of our century. Wesometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the complexity of ourdecisions, the agony of our choices. But there is no comfort or securityfor us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief inirresponsibility.A year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that fewgenerations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the greatdefender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our goodfortune; and I welcome it now as I did a year ago. For it is the fate ofthis generation--of you in the Congress and of me as President--to livewith a struggle we did not start, in a world we did not make. But thepressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while nonation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been so readyto seize the burden and the glory of freedom.And in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of America.***State of the Union AddressJohn F. KennedyJanuary 14, 1963Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 88th Congress:I congratulate you all--not merely on your electoral victory but on yourselected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the greatRepublic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history. Thechoices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union forgenerations yet to come.Little more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of theUnited States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, Ipledged no easy answers. I pledged--and asked--only toil and dedication.These the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today,having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our nationalpurpose and power--having seen the courageous calm of a united people ina perilous hour--and having observed a steady improvement in theopportunities and well-being of our citizens--I can report to you thatthe state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life,is good.In the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in buildinga world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure. Asettlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos. Thespearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet-Nam. The end of agony maybe in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead. And, while dangercontinues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.At home, the recession is behind us. Well over a million more men and womenare working today than were working 2 years ago. The average factorywork week is once again more than 40 hours; our industries are turning outmore goods than ever before; and more than half of the manufacturingcapacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is humming withactivity.In short, both at home and abroad, there may now be a temptation to relax.For the road has been long, the burden heavy, and the pace consistentlyurgent.But we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill, notthe top. The mere absence of war is not peace. The mere absence ofrecession is not growth. We have made a beginning--but we have only begun.Now the time has come to make the most of our gains--to translate therenewal of our national strength into the achievement of our nationalpurpose.                                   I.America has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery. Butrecovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we mustexpand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path toa higher rate of growth and full employment.For this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year inproduction, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end tothe persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percentfor 61 out of the past 62 months--and an end to the growing pressures forsuch restrictive measures as the 35-hour week, which alone could increasehourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage-price spiralof inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations.To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential--theenactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in Federalincome taxes.For it is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and laborwho are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete tax systemexerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, andemployment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checksgrowth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts the useof resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federalrevenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.Now, when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post-war years nolonger threaten, and the dollar commands new respect--now, when no militarycrisis strains our resources--now is the time to act. We cannot afford tobe timid or slow. For this is the most urgent task confronting the Congressin 1963.In an early message, I shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rateswhich will lower liabilities by $13.5 billion. Of this, $11 billion resultsfrom reducing individual tax rates, which now range between 20 and 91percent, to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent, with a split in thepresent first bracket. Two and one-half billion dollars results fromreducing corporate tax rates, from 52 percent--which gives the Governmenttoday a majority interest in profits--to the permanent pre-Korean level of47 percent. This is in addition to the more than $2 billion cut incorporate tax liabilities resulting from last year's investment credit anddepreciation reform.To achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetarydeficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years,beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second,that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes,beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair orunnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in thenet offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetaryreceipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without anychange in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of largecorporations to a more current time schedule. This combined program, byincreasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in stillhigher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally responsible program--the surestand the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balancedfull employment economy.This net reduction in tax liabilities of $10 billion will increase thepurchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every taxbracket, with greatest increase going to our low-income consumers. It will,in addition, encourage the initiative and risk-taking on which our freesystem depends--induce more investment, production, and capacity use--helpprovide the 2 million new jobs we need every year--and reinforce theAmerican principle of additional reward for additional effort.I do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way toachieve these goals.No doubt a massive increase in Federal spending could also create jobsand growth, but in today's setting, private consumers, employers, andinvestors should be given a full opportunity first.No doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy--but along-run problem compels a long-run solution.No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alonewould be of great help--but corporations need customers and job seekersneed jobs.No doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and moreattractive to many--but our growth is also hampered by a host of taxinequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow ofinvestment.And finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a taxcut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possiblean equivalent cut in expenditures--but that end is not in view and to waitfor it would be costly and self-defeating.In submitting a tax program which will, of course, temporarily increase thedeficit but can ultimately end it--and in recognition of the need tocontrol expenditures--I will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrativebudget which, while allowing for needed rises in defense, space, and fixedinterest charges, holds total expenditures for all other purposes belowthis year's level.This requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs, theabsorption of a large part of last year's Federal pay raise throughpersonnel and other economies, the termination of certain installations andprojects, and the substitution in several programs of private for publiccredit. But I am convinced that the enactment this year of tax reductionand tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress.For we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom, if we evercease to set the pace here at home.                                  II.Tax reduction alone, however, is not enough to strengthen our society, toprovide opportunities for the four million Americans who are born everyyear, to improve the lives of 32 million Americans who live on theoutskirts of poverty.The quality of American life must keep pace with the quantity of Americangoods.This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.Therefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keepwithin the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative toadopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone.These measures are based on a series of fundamental premises, grouped underfour related headings:First, we need to strengthen our Nation by investing in our youth.The future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom ofits citizens is damaged, and irreparably damaged, whenever any of itschildren is not educated to the full extent of his talent, from gradeschool through graduate school. Today, an estimated 4 out of every 10students in the 5th grade will not even finish high school--and that is awaste we cannot afford.In addition, there is no reason why one million young Americans, out ofschool and out of work, should all remain unwanted and often untrained onour city streets when their energies can be put to good use.Finally, the overseas success of our Peace Corps volunteers, most of themyoung men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people, suggests themerit of a similar corps serving our own community needs: in mentalhospitals, on Indian reservations, in centers for the aged or for youngdelinquents, in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped. As theidealism of our youth has served world peace, so can it serve the domestictranquility.Second, we need to strengthen our Nation by safeguarding its health.Our working men and women, instead of being forced to beg for help frompublic charity once they are old and ill, should start contributing now totheir own retirement health program through the Social Security System.Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little ifwe cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, andnurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urbanhospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors anddentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 yearsincrease the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dentalschools by 100 percent.Finally, and of deep concern, I believe that the abandonment of thementally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodialinstitutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needlesscruelty which this Nation should not endure. The incidence of mentalretardation in this country is three times as high as that of Sweden, forexample--and that figure can and must be reduced.Third, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights ofits citizens.The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused ofcrime in Federal court, regardless of his means.And the most precious and powerful right in the world, the right to votein a free American election, must not be denied to any citizen on groundsof his race or color. I wish that all qualified Americans permitted to votewere willing to vote, but surely in this centennial year of Emancipationall those who are willing to vote should always be permitted.Fourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the mosteconomical use of its resources and facilities.Our economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries; and Ibelieve the way to a more modern, economical choice of nationaltransportation service is through increased competition and decreasedregulation. Local mass transit, faring even worse, is as essential acommunity service as hospitals and highways. Nearly three-fourths of ourcitizens live in urban areas, which occupy only 2 percent of our land--andif local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of these cities,it needs Federal stimulation and assistance.Next, this Government is in the storage and stockpile business to themelancholy tune of more than $16 billion. We must continue to support farmincome, but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the $7.5billion we already own. We must maintain a stockpile of strategicmaterials, but the $8.5 billion we have acquired--for reasons both good andbad--is much more than we need; and we should be empowered to dispose ofthe excess in ways which will not cause market disruption.Finally, our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas willhave twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today. If we donot plan today for the future growth of these and other great naturalassets--not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness preserves,and water projects of all kinds--our children and their children will bepoorer in every sense of the word.These are not domestic concerns alone. For upon our achievement of greatervitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world:our ability to sustain and supply the security of free men and nations, ourability to command their respect for our leadership, our ability to expandour trade without threat to our balance of payments, and our ability toadjust to the changing demands of cold war competition and challenge.We shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preachabroad. Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would helpthem half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponentscould do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as muchas a chronic, lagging U.S. economy. These domestic tasks do not divertenergy from our security--they provide the very foundation for freedom'ssurvival and success.                                 III.Turning to the world outside, it was only a few years ago--in SoutheastAsia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, even outer space--thatcommunism sought to convey the image of a unified, confident, and expandingempire, closing in on a sluggish America and a free world in disarray. Butfew people would hold to that picture today.In these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and militarysuperiority of freedom. We have doubled our efforts in space, to assure usof being first in the future. We have undertaken the most far-reachingdefense improvements in the peacetime history of this country. And we havemaintained the frontiers of freedom from Viet-Nam to West Berlin.But complacency or self-congratulation can imperil our security as much asthe weapons of tyranny. A moment of pause is not a promise of peace.Dangerous problems remain from Cuba to the South China Sea. The world'sprognosis prescribes, in short, not a year's vacation for us, but a year ofobligation and opportunity.Four special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, thedeveloping nations, the new Sino-Soviet difficulties, and the search forworldwide peace.                                 IV.First, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a newphase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion haspassed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era ofinterdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies ofMarx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nationsof Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy inevery sphere of activity.For 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both politicaland economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcomepartner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and freedom is stilllong, and there are burdens which only full partners can share--insupporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning ourbalance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concertingpolitical and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effortother industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic andpolitical development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the worldscene a major constructive role.No doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention thanagreements on action, as Europe moves from independence to more formalinterdependence. But these are honest differences among honorableassociates--more real and frequent, in fact, among our Western Europeanallies than between them and the United States. For the unity of freedomhas never relied on uniformity of opinion. But the basic agreement of thisalliance on fundamental issues continues.The first task of the alliance remains the common defense. Last month PrimeMinister Macmillan and I laid plans for a new stage in our long cooperativeeffort, one which aims to assist in the wider task of framing a commonnuclear defense for the whole alliance.The Nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the West isindivisible, and so must be our defense. But it also recognizes that thisis an alliance of proud and sovereign nations, and works best when we donot forget it. It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the Westis not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone--that France will besuch a power in the future--and that ways must be found without increasingthe hazards of nuclear diffusion, to increase the role of our otherpartners in planning, manning, and directing a truly multilateral nuclearforce within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance. Finally, the Nassauagreement recognizes that nuclear defense is not enough, that the agreedNATO levels of conventional strength must be met, and that the alliancecannot afford to be in a position of having to answer every threat withnuclear weapons or nothing.We remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their fullrealization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for thefirst time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance tobecome a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.The next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic goalsof trade and growth. This Nation continues to be concerned about itsbalance-of-payments deficit, which, despite its decline, remains a stubbornand troublesome problem. We believe, moreover, that closer economic tiesamong all free nations are essential to prosperity and peace. And neitherwe nor the members of the European Common Market are so affluent that wecan long afford to shelter high cost farms or factories from the winds offoreign competition, or to restrict the channels of trade with othernations of the free world. If the Common Market should move towardprotectionism and restrictionism, it would undermine its own basicprinciples. This Government means to use the authority conferred on it lastyear by the Congress to encourage trade expansion on both sides of theAtlantic and around the world.                                   V.Second, what of the developing and non-aligned nations? They were shockedby the Soviets' sudden and secret attempt to transform Cuba into a nuclearstriking base--and by Communist China's arrogant invasion of India. Theyhave been reassured by our prompt assistance to India, by our supportthrough the United Nations of the Congo's unification, by our patientsearch for disarmament, and by the improvement in our treatment of citizensand visitors whose skins do not happen to be white. And as the oldercolonialism recedes, and the neo-colonialism of the Communist powers standsout more starkly than ever, they realize more clearly that the issue in theworld struggle is not communism versus capitalism, but coercion versus freechoice.They are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the samethe world over, whether it is the independence of West Berlin or Viet-Nam.They are beginning to realize that such independence runs athwart allCommunist ambitions but is in keeping with our own--and that our approachto their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful, while the Communistsare still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas.Nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external orsubversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained indaily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little sensefor us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, tospend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance--and then tobegrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one-tenth ofthat amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and curethe social chaos in which communism has always thrived.I am proud--and I think most Americans are proud--of a mutual defense andassistance program, evolved with bipartisan support in threeadministrations, which has, with all its recognized problems, contributedto the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty U.N. members to gainindependence since the Second World War has succumbed to Communistcontrol.I am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe millionsof people who live on the front lines of freedom.I am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60's a vastcooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progressthroughout the Americas--the Alliance for Progress.I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effortamong our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, workingin close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality.Today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in LatinAmerica an extra food ration from our farm surplus. It has distributed 1.5million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms. It has helpedresettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call theirown. It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self-help andself-reform--fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms. It isbringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who wereforgotten. The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliancecannot succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts--thatit can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote theirbest effort to fulfilling its goals.This story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Wherevernations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them buildnew bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; wehave gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike. Whatwe do ask--and all that we ask--is that our help be used to best advantage,and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with otherindependent nations.Despite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the MutualAssistance Program requires a persistent discontent with presentperformance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a moreeffective, efficient instrument--and that process will continue this year.But free world development will still be an uphill struggle. Government aidcan only supplement the role of private investment, trade expansion,commodity stabilization, and, above all, internal self-improvement. Theprocesses of growth are gradual--bearing fruit in a decade, not a day. Oursuccesses will be neither quick nor dramatic. But if these programs wereever to be ended, our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden andcertain.Neither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weaponagainst poverty. In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose,requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothingcarries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the farcorners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.A year ago, less than 900 Peace Corps volunteers were on the job. A yearfrom now they will number more than 9,000--men and women, aged 18 to 79,willing to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands.There are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country andthe cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match.Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; bysupporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to foreign visitors anddiplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well asword, that we are a just and generous people.                                  VI.Third, what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensionswithin the Communist bloc? Here hope must be tempered with caution. For theSoviet-Chinese disagreement is over means, not ends. A dispute over howbest to bury the free world is no grounds for Western rejoicing.Nevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forcesof diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the irondisciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology. Marxis proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, notthe free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds ofinternal disintegration.The disarray of the Communist empire has been heightened by two otherformidable forces. One is the historical force of nationalism--and theyearning of all men to be free. The other is the gross inefficiency oftheir economies. For a closed society is not open to ideas of progress--anda police state finds that it cannot command the grain to grow.New nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compareconditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North andSouth Viet-Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of CommunistCuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all the world knowsthat no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedomout--and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communistfailure.                                 VII.Finally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduringpeace? Again I would counsel caution. I foresee no spectacular reversal inCommunist methods or goals. But if all these trends and developments canpersuade the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace, then let her know thatall free nations will journey with her. But until that choice is made, anduntil the world can develop a reliable system of international security,the free peoples have no choice but to keep their arms nearby.This country, therefore, continues to require the best defense in theworld--a defense which is suited to the sixties. This means, unfortunately,a rising defense budget--for there is no substitute for adequate defense,and no "bargain basement" way of achieving it. It means the expenditure ofmore than $15 billion this year on nuclear weapons systems alone, a sumwhich is about equal to the combined defense budgets of our EuropeanAllies.But it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civildefense, a strengthened anti-guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance,more powerful and flexible non-nuclear forces. For threats of massiveretaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression--and a line of destroyers ina quarantine, or a division of well-equipped men on a border, may be moreuseful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weaponsbeyond all rational need.But our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand ourmilitary establishment indefinitely. We do not dismiss disarmament asmerely an idle dream. For we believe that, in the end, it is the only wayto assure the security of all without impairing the interests of any. Nordo we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement. While we shall neverweary in the defense of freedom, neither shall we ever abandon the pursuitof peace.In this quest, the United Nations requires our full and continued support.Its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role inthe West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for the Cuban crisis,and in its task of unification in the Congo. Today the United Nations isprimarily the protector of the small and the weak, and a safety valve forthe strong. Tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law--a worldin which no nation dictates the destiny of another, and in which the vastresources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends.In short, let our adversaries choose. If they choose peaceful competition,they shall have it. If they come to realize that their ambitions cannotsucceed--if they see their "wars of liberation" and subversion willultimately fail--if they recognize that there is more security in acceptinginspection than in permitting new nations to master the black arts ofnuclear war--and if they are willing to turn their energies, as we are, tothe great unfinished tasks of our own peoples--then, surely, the areas ofagreement can be very wide indeed: a clear understanding about Berlin,stability in Southeast Asia, an end to nuclear testing, new checks onsurprise or accidental attack, and, ultimately, general and completedisarmament.                                 VIII.For we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but aworldwide victory of man. The modern globe is too small, its weapons aretoo destructive, and its disorders are too contagious to permit any otherkind of victory.To achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greaterportion of its national production than any other people in the free world.For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself. Throughhot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages ofthe atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and theirfaith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem to make lifedifficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficultfor us all.But difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and memorabledays in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for example, of MajorRudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba. We saluteSpecialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea. Wepay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet-Nam. They areamong the many who in this century, far from home, have died for ourcountry. Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to theircommitment.My friends: I close on a note of hope. We are not lulled by the momentarycalm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above. We know the turbulencethat lies below, and the storms that are beyond the horizon this year. Butnow the winds of change appear to be blowing more strongly than ever, inthe world of communism as well as our own. For 175 years we have sailedwith those winds at our back, and with the tides of human freedom in ourfavor. We steer our ship with hope, as Thomas Jefferson said, "leaving Fearastern."Today we still welcome those winds of change--and we have every reason tobelieve that our tide is running strong. With thanks to Almighty God forseeing us through a perilous passage, we ask His help anew in guiding the"Good Ship Union."*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF ADDRESSES BY JOHN F.

B-o-y-s!"There was no response to the imperative summons.Professor Zepplin sat up in his cot, listening intently.  Somethinghad awakened him suddenly, but just what he was unable to decide."Be quiet over there, young men," he admonished, adding in a lowertone, "I'm sure I heard some one moving about."The camp of the Pony Rider Boys lay wrapped in darkness, the camp-firehaving long since died out.  Not a sound disturbed the stillness ofthe night save the soft murmurings of the foliage, stirred in a gentlebreeze that was drifting in from the southwest.The Professor climbed from his cot, and, without waiting to draw onhis clothes, stepped outside.  He stood listening in front of his tentfor several minutes, but heard nothing of a disturbing nature."I believe those young rascals are up to some of their pranks--eitherthat, or I have been having bad dreams.  While I'm up I might as wellmake sure," he decided, tip-toeing to the tent occupied by Tad Butlerand Walter Perkins.Both were apparently sleeping soundly, while in an adjoining tent NedRector and Stacy Brown were breathing regularly, sleeping the sleepthat naturally comes after a day in the saddle over the rugged, unevenslopes of the Ozark Mountains.Professor Zepplin uttered something that sounded not unlike anIndian's grunt of disgust."Dreams!" he decided sharply.  "I should not have eaten that pie lastnight.  Pie doesn't seem to trouble those boys in the least, but itcertainly has a bad effect on my digestive apparatus."Having thus delivered himself of his opinion on the value of pie as abedtime food, the scientist trotted back to his tent, his teethchattering and shoulders shrugging, for the mountain air was chill andthe Professor was clad only in his pajamas.No sooner had he settled himself between his comforting blankets,however, than he suddenly started up again with a mutteredexclamation."I knew it!  I told you so!"This time there could be no doubt.  He plainly heard a dry twig snapnear by; whether it were under the weight of man or beast, he did notknow."There is something out there.  It couldn't have been the pie afterall.  I'm going to find out what it is before I get back into this bedagain," he decided firmly, slipping quietly from under the covers andpeering out through the half closed flap of his tent.As before, all was silence, the drowsy, indistinct voices of the nightpassing almost without notice.But Professor Zepplin instead of waiting where he was, reached for hisrevolver and then strode boldly out into the open space in front ofthe tents, determined to solve the mystery, and, if possible, withoutwaking the boys.The reader no doubt already has recognized in the four boys sleepingin the little weather-beaten tents the same lads who some time beforehad started off for a vacation in the mountains where they hunted thecougar and the bobcat, the thrilling adventures met with on thatjourney having been related in a former volume entitled, "THE PONYRIDER BOYS IN THE ROCKIES."They will be remembered, too, as the lads who, in "THE PONY RIDER BOYSIN TEXAS," crossed the plains on a cattle drive, during the course ofwhich Tad Butler bravely saved the life of the Chinese cook, byplunging into a swollen torrent; and later, saved a large part of thegreat herd, himself being nearly trampled to death in a wild stampedeof the cattle.It will be recalled also, how Tad Butler and his companions, aftermany strange and startling experiences, solved the veiled riddle ofthe plains and laid the ghost of the old church of San Miguel, for alltime.The stirring adventures of "THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN MONTANA," too, arestill fresh in the minds of those who have followed the fortunes ofthe four lads since they first started out on their journeyings.It will he recalled that in the latter story the lads experienced thethrill of being in a real battle between the cowboys and the sheepherders on the free-grass range of the north; how Tad Butler wascaptured by the Blackfeet Indians, and how, with the help of an Indianmaiden, he managed to make his escape.It will also be remembered that Tad was able to rescue another ladwho, like himself, had been taken by the Blackfeet, and to return theboy to his father, none the worse for his exciting experiences.  Itwill be recalled as well, how Tad Butler through his own effortssolved the mystery of the old Custer trail--a mystery that hadperplexed and annoyed the ranchers along the historic trail for manymonths.And now they were once more in the saddle, having chosen the OzarkMountains in southwestern Missouri as the scene of their nextexplorations.With them they carried a pack train of four mules, these being bestadapted to packing the boys' belongings over the rugged mountains.For their guide they had engaged a full-blooded Shawnee Indian namedJoe Hawk, known among his people as Eagle-eye, making a party of six,with eight head of stock in all.At the time of the beginning of this narrative the Pony Riders wereencamped on a fork of the White River some three days out fromSpringfield.  Joe Hawk had asked permission to leave the party for thenight to pay a visit to a fellow-tribesman who lived somewhere in themountains to the west of them.On second thought it occurred to Professor Zepplin that perhaps itmight have been Joe, or Eagle-eye, as the boys had decided to call theIndian, whom he had heard skulking about the camp."Eagle-eye," he called softly.There was no response, so the Professor, gripping his gun resolutely,crept along toward the opposite side of the camp where the noise hadseemed to come from. So quietly had he moved that he made scarcely asound, until suddenly there came a commotion that more than made upfor the noise he had so successfully avoided before.Stacy Brown, with his usual forgetfulness, had left his saddle in themiddle of the camp.  The Professor caught his toe on the obstruction,measuring his length on the ground instantly, where he flounderedabout for a few seconds."Instead of discovering the other fellow, I think I am discoveringmyself," he growled, scrambling to his feet, gingerly rubbing a knee.Now the Professor walked with a distinct limp, while his bare feetseemed to pick up every sharp pebble in camp, all of which added tohis discomfort."I'd make a nice sort of scout," he muttered.  "Everybody within amile of me would know I was coming even before I got started, Iguess--"The Professor suddenly cut short his words, and crouched down close tothe ground.  He thought he heard something ahead and a little to theright of him."Who's there?" he demanded.No answer being made to his inquiry, he gripped his gun more firmlyand crawled cautiously toward the spot where he thought he had heardsome one moving.  The night was so dark that he could make nothing outof the shadows about him, being obliged therefore to trust entirely tohis sense of hearing.Now he was certain that some one was in camp who had no businessthere, for the sound of footsteps was plainly borne to hisears--cautious, catlike steps, as if the intruder were seeking to getaway without attracting attention.The Professor, determined to capture the intruder, getting down on allfours to avoid possible detection, made a wide detour so as to come upbehind where the fellow seemed to be at that moment.  After much laborhe managed to reach the desired position.The Professor straightened up to listen.  He must be close upon theother by this time.  But what was his chagrin to hear those samefootsteps on the opposite side of the camp.  Professor Zepplin by mucheffort had just come from the other side himself."Stupid!" he muttered.  "I'll take no roundabout way this time.  I'llgo straight ahead and be as quiet about it as I can."He did so.  He moved straight across the camp ground, not forgettingthe saddle which he carefully avoided, but narrowly missing fallingover it a second time.By the time he had crossed to his former position, the intruder haddone likewise.  Professor Zepplin dodged behind a tree.By this time the scientist was beginning to feel a little worried.  Hecould not understand what the other fellow's object might be.  If itwere robbery, the fellow certainly would desire to get away as quicklyas possible, rather than remain when he knew that efforts were beingmade to capture him.  If not plunder, what could be his purpose?With suddenly formed determination, Professor Zepplin strode out fromhis hiding place, starting for the other side on a run.The other man did the same, and the only result of the move was thattheir positions were exchanged.Once more the Professor decided to try strategy and see if he couldnot come up behind his opponent.At the same moment the visitor apparently decided to resort to thesame tactics.  They went in opposite directions, however, to carry outtheir purpose, and when each arrived at the place it was to find thatthe other was opposite him again.The Professor's bare feet were in a sad state by this time, hispajamas were torn and his hands were worn tender from using them forfeet when running along on all fours.  At the same time his temper waswearing to a point of dangerous thinness.  It was likely to break downthe slender barrier that held it at almost any time.Suddenly he realized that the intruder had been silent for someminutes, and the Professor decided that it was time he ceased thinkingover his own troubles and paid more attention to what the other manwas doing."Now, I wonder what he is up to," growled the scientist.  "I believehe has given me the slip and gotten away.  Here I've been dreaming forminutes.  I'll slip some myself and see if I can't surprise him ifhe's there yet."Once again he started across the camp ground, without resorting to anyof his former tactics, other than to proceed with extreme caution,covering the intervening space with long, careful strides.Reaching the rock, he paused to listen, but could hear nothing.Gun ready for instant use, Professor Zepplin dashed around the cornerof the rock, running plump into the arms of the fellow whom he hadbeen so successfully dodging for the past twenty minutes.So startled was the scientist that he dropped his revolver, throwingboth arms about his antagonist.  He was surprised at the slendernessof the fellow, though he quickly discovered that what the other lackedin bulk he easily made up for by his lithe, supple body and musculararms.Almost before Professor Zepplin had collected his wits sufficiently tomake any sort of defense he found himself lying flat on his back, withhis opponent sitting on top of him, both wrists pinioned to the groundin an iron grip.There seemed to the Professor something strangely familiar about thefigure that was holding him down so firmly, but he did not try toanalyze the impression.  He had other things to think of at thatmoment."I'll wait a second until he lets up ever so little, then, with mysuperior weight, I ought to be able to throw him--""I've got you this time.  What do you mean by prowling about our campat this time of the--""Wha--what--who--who--" exclaimed the Professor."What!" fairly shouted the other.  "Who--who are you?""I'm Professor Zepplin.  Who are you?""Oh, shucks!  I'm Tad Butler," answered the boy, hastily releasing hisprisoner, and, more crestfallen than he would have cared to admit,assisting the Professor to his feet."What do you mean, you young rascal?" demanded the Professor, graspingthe boy by the shoulders and shaking him vigorously.  "I say, what doyou mean by playing such pranks on me as this?  Why, I might have shotyou.  I--""You are wrong, Professor; I have not intentionally played pranks onyou--""Yes you have--yes you have," fumed the Professor."I might accuse you of doing the same thing to me, only I know youdidn't get up in the middle of the night to play hide and seek with aboy--""Then what does this mean?  Answer me instantly!""I can do so easily.  The fact is, I heard somebody prowling around.The slight noise awakened me--""I should think it might," snarled Professor Zepplin."And, without waiting to dress, I slipped out--""And led me a nice chase.  Look at me.  There isn't a spot on my bodythat isn't black and blue.  And to think I've been running around herein my bare feet trying to catch you--""You haven't entirely.  You were chasing the same thing that I was,"answered Tad thoughtfully."What's that? What's that you say?""I mean that somebody was here--somebody who had no business to behere.""You mean--""Yes, I mean that after I had been out here a few moments I distinctlyheard two men.  One of them, it appears, was yourself.  Who the otherwas I don't know.  He evidently got away.  As I couldn't follow bothof them, I chose you.  You seemed to be the easiest one to catch.  Iwas right, wasn't I?" laughed the boy, at the thought of the game theyhad been playing with each other."Somebody else here?  I knew it, I knew it," exclaimed the Professor."When I first came out you were sound asleep.  I must have awakenedyou when I fell over the saddle out there.  Who left that thing therefor me to nearly break my neck on?" he demanded angrily."I guess it must be Chunky's saddle.""Of course.  I'll talk to him in the morning.  I'm going to bed.  I'llcatch my death of cold."CHAPTER IIA PACK MULE GOES OVER A CLIFFNext morning the boys, assisted by Eagle-eye, had prepared thebreakfast by the time the Professor had awakened.  They took keensatisfaction in calling him for breakfast.  Ordinarily they slept solate that the Professor had to turn them out by physical force."Anybody'd think you'd been keeping late hours, Professor," laughedNed Rector."Perhaps I have," answered the scientist good naturedly.  "But if so,I am not the only one of this party who has."That the Professor's words held some meaning unknown to them the boyswere fully aware.  Tad had said nothing of his experiences of theprevious night, so they did not think to turn to him for anexplanation."I might as well tell you, young gentlemen, that there was some oneprowling about this camp after we all were asleep last night--""What!" cried the Pony Riders in sudden surprise."Yes, that is true.  Thaddeus and myself chased him around for nearlyhalf an hour, but--"All eyes were now turned on Tad, who was bending over his plate thatthey might not observe the grin that was spreading over his facedespite the lad's effort to keep it down."O Tad, tell us all about it," urged Walter Perkins.  "What was he, abold robber or what?""I guess he must have been an 'Or What,'" suggested Stacy Brownwisely."Don't mind him.  He's dreaming still.  It's only his appetite that'shere at the table.  The rest of him is in bed asleep," jeered NedRector, with such a funny grimace that the boys laughed."Yes," answered Tad, looking up, "we ran around here in our pajamasuntil we found each other.  Then we gave it up and went to bed.""But who was it?" insisted Walter."It was an--""Now, never mind, Chunky.  You are supposed to be asleep," admonishedNed, with a superior wave of his hand."I cannot say as to that," answered Tad.  "I really don't think itamounted to so very much.  Probably some prowler curious to know whatsort of camp he had stumbled upon.  I didn't lose any sleep over itafter I got back to bed.""Neither did Chunky," laughed Ned."Did you?" asked the fat boy sharply, turning the laugh on Ned."You remember what we were told in Springfield," said Walter."What was that?" asked the Professor."That a band of robbers had been causing considerable excitement inthe Ozarks for several months past.""Yes, you are right.  I had forgotten that," nodded Professor Zepplin."Stealing horses and other things.""Yes.""But it's all nonsense to think they would bother us," objected Ned."We haven't anything that they would want.""No, nor do we want them," replied Walter, with emphasis.  "I guess wehad better sleep on our rifles to-night.""That will hardly be necessary," smiled the Professor."How about Eagle-eye?" asked Ned.  "Didn't he hear anything?""Eagle-eye was away last night.""Oh, yes, that's so.  I had forgotten that.""It might be a good idea to tell him about it," suggested Tad,glancing over at the Professor.Professor Zepplin nodded his head."Eagle-eye, will you come here, please?" called Tad.The Shawnee, who had been pottering about the camp-fire, strode overto them with his almost noiseless tread, and squatted on the groundnear the breakfast table."There was somebody here last night, Eagle-eye," Tad informed him inan impressive voice.The Shawnee nodded."Of course, you not having been here, you knew nothing about it, butto-night you'd better sleep with one eye open."Joe Hawk know," answered the Indian."Know what?" demanded the Professor sharply."Know Indian come last night," was the startling announcement."What's that?  What's that, Eagle-eye?  You mean yourself, I presume.You mean you came back.  But that is not the point--"The Indian shook his head with emphasis."Other Indian come."Tad nodded at his companions as if to say, "I told you so."Then the Shawnee did know more than he had seen fit to tell them?"Tell us about it, Eagle-eye.""Joe Hawk find trail of canoe on river at sun-up," answered the Indiantersely."A trail on the river?" demanded Stacy, suddenly breaking intouproarious laughter, which died away in an indistinct gurgle when hefound the eyes of his companions fixed sternly upon him.  "Funny placeto find a trail," he muttered, threatening to indulge in another fitof merriment."I don't understand you, Eagle-eye," said the Professor.  "You say youfound the trail of a canoe on the river?""Yes.""That sounds peculiar.  I agree with Master Stacy that it is a mostremarkable place to find a trail hours after.  Perhaps you willexplain."Eagle-eye rose to his feet."Come. I show you."All rose from the table, forgetful that they were eating theirbreakfast, and followed the guide down the steep bank to the river."There trail," he announced, pointing a long, bronzed finger at theedge of the water.Tad stooped over, examining the shore critically."The Shawnee is right," he said, turning to the Professor."How do you know?  What have you found?""There.  You can see for yourself.  It is distinctly marked--""What's marked?"  demanded Stacy, pressing forward."You can see where the keel of a canoe has rested in the dirt there.The trail is ever so faint, but it is unmistakably there.  See how itbroadens out as it extends backward until it reaches the gravel in thestream.""Moccasin tracks," grunted the guide."Where?" asked Walter, apprehensively."There," answered the Indian, pointing up the bank whence they hadjust come.The boys looked at each other in wondering silence."What do you think is the meaning of the visit, Eagle-eye?" asked theProfessor.The Shawnee shrugged his shoulders."Mebby hungry.""That is a sensible explanation of the visit," decided ProfessorZepplin.  "What other motive could an Indian have for a visit at thathour?  There is no cause for alarm.  But I wish if any more hungryones pay us a visit, they would do so in the day time, so as not tointerrupt my sleep.""And mine," laughed Tad."Yah-hum," yawned Stacy, sleepily."I told you you weren't awake yet," growled Ned.  "Let's all go backto our breakfast.""I second the motion," laughed the Professor.  "We are forgetting allabout the inner man.  And it is time we were getting on our way if weare to make any great progress to-day."Anxious to be in the saddle again, the boys bounded up the bank andhastily finished their breakfast.  While they were doing so the guidestoically busied himself with packing the cooking kits and loading thepack mules, so that by the time the lads were ready all save their ownbelongings had been stowed away.It was the work of a few minutes only to strike their tents, foldblankets and pack their personal belongings.  They had now beenroughing it long enough so that they had become really expert in thework.  And, besides, they had learned to get together a fairlysatisfying meal out of not much of anything.  They had learned manyother things that were to prove useful to them in after years, butwhich at the time was making little or no impression upon them.Fairly radiating health and spirits, the boys threw themselves intotheir saddles with a shout.  The guide led the way, leading the muletrain, and his pace was so rapid that the pack animals were put totheir best to keep up with him.  Most of the time he appeared to bedragging the led mule, instead of leading it."A wonderful country," breathed the Professor, as they finally cameout on a high elevation that gave them a glimpse of the eastern slopeof the mountains.They halted to take in the magnificent view."This is what is known as the 'Ozark Uplift,'" the Professor informedthem."I should call it a downfall," answered Ned, gazing off at the deepgorges and jagged precipices.  "Why do you call it that?"The Professor waxed eloquent."From the earliest time, young gentlemen, this region has been subjectto uprising or downsinking.  In all sections of its area it hasexperienced the effects of powerful dynamic forces--""Dynamite--did they use dynamite to blow the mountains up into suchshapes as that?" asked Stacy innocently."I said nothing about dynamite.  Dynamic was the word I used," repliedProfessor Zepplin, casting a withering glance at the fat boy."Oh," Stacy exclaimed."It is therefore called the 'Ozark Uplift.'""That is interesting," answered Ned solemnly, though it is doubtful ifhe understood what the Professor was really talking about."There is still another of tremendous import connected with thisregion.  You will all be interested in it," announced the Professorimpressively.The boys gathered about him in a circle, meantime allowing theirponies to nibble at the green leaves."Yes," urged Tad."The region where is now located the Ozark Uplift is said to have beenthe first land to appear above the waters of the continental ocean.""You--you mean--" stammered Ned."He means this was the first land to appear above the water when thiscontinent was all an ocean," spoke up Tad, with quick understanding.Stacy urged his pony further into the circle.  His face was flushedand he evidently was filled with some sudden new thought."What is it, Master Stacy?" asked the Professor."You--you say this was the first land to--""Yes, so it has been said.""Then--then this--then this must have been where the Ark landed,"exploded the fat boy.For a few seconds a profound silence greeted this announcement.  Thenthe lads broke out into a shout of laughter.  Even Professor Zepplinthrew his head back and laughed immoderately."I am afraid, my young friend, that the place where the ancient craftran aground was some distance from this rugged spot--""But why not?" persisted the boy."In the first place, this continent came to life some time after theevent you speak of is supposed to have taken place.""Oh," muttered the lad."And now we had better be pressing on.""When do we reach the Red Star Mine?" asked Ned."You will have to ask Eagle-eye.  I don't know."The Indian, when questioned on this point, said the Red Star Mine laythree suns to the southwest of them.The country seemed to be getting more rough as they proceeded, and ithad now become necessary to move with extreme caution for fear ofplunging over one of the many abrupt cliffs that now and then appearedalmost under the feet of the advancing train.But the Indian seemed to feel no concern over these.  He merelychanged his course, skirting the canyon until a turn in its windingcourse enabled him to head straight into the southwest again.Not even in the Rockies had the boys met with such peculiar formationsas now appeared on all sides of them."I'd hate to travel this trail in the night," growled Stacy."You wouldn't have to travel it far," laughed Tad.  "You'd be walkingon air before you knew it."Stacy had pressed on ahead while the others were talking.  He hadobserved what they had not.  One of the pack mules had lagged behind,and with head lowered almost to the ground appeared to have gone soundasleep.  The Shawnee, engaged with his own thoughts, apparently wasunaware that he had left a mule behind.The fat boy, with great glee, was urging his pony quietly along,approaching the pack animal with as much caution as possible.  It wasStacy's intention to give the beast the fright of its life, in whichambition he succeeded beyond his fondest anticipations.Getting near enough for his purpose, Stacy slipped from his pony,hunted about until he found a stick long enough for his purpose, andwith this crept up on the sleeping mule.With a shrill shriek the lad brought the stick down on the long-earedanimal's rump with a whack that, while it could not have hurt, did allthat he had hoped it might.Both the mule's hind feet shot up into the air, while the beast with ashort, sharp bray of fright lunged straight ahead.The guide uttered a shrill exclamation of warning as he saw the muletearing through the bushes to the left of the trail.  Leaving his twopack animals, Eagle-eye leaped for the fleeing one.But he was too late.All at once the frightened beast appeared to stand on his head, hishind feet beating a tattoo in the air; then he disappeared altogether.The Pony Rider Boys, hearing the disturbance, had hurried up, and justin time to see the final scene in the little tragedy that theircompanion had caused."What's this?  What's this?" demanded the Professor.  "What's thematter?""Pony fall down!  Pony fall down!" exclaimed the Indian, with a traceof excitement in his tone."He means our long-eared friend has taken a header over that rockthere," Ned Rector informed them."I am afraid it is more serious than that," added Tad.  "It looked tome as if the pack mule went over a cliff.""Him fall down, fall down, fall down," repeated the guide.Chunky, frightened at the result of his prank, had quickly scrambledinto his own saddle and drawn back from the scene of his late exploit.Professor Zepplin did not understand how it had happened."I'm to blame, sir," announced Chunky, plucking up courage and ridingup beside the Professor.  "I hit him with a stick and he ran away."In spite of the disaster that had come upon them, the boys could notbut laugh at the boy's rueful countenance.  Nor did the Professor findit in his heart to be harsh."You deserve to be punished, sir, but somehow when I look at you myanger vanishes instantly.  The next question is, how are we going toget the beast up here?  What do you say, guide?""Him dead.""What's that?""Pack pony, him gone Happy Hunting Ground.""You don't mean he has been killed?"The guide nodded with emphasis, at the same time bringing the palms ofhis hands sharply together to convey the impression that the mule hadhit the rocks below so hard that he would never rise of his own accordagain."Now we are in a fix," said Ned."I guess we had better make Chunky walk and use his pony for packingthe outfit," suggested Walter."Yes, but we have little or no outfit to pack," answered Tad.  "Mostof it is down there with the dead mule; how far I don't know."The Pony Rider Boys gasped.  This, indeed, was a serious situation.CHAPTER IIIA DARING PROPOSALFor a full moment the boys looked at each other doubtfully.  ProfessorZepplin was the first to break the silence."Wha--what pack did the mule have?""Part of the kitchen outfit and all of the canned goods," answered TadButler impressively.Ned Rector laughed."This is where we give our stomachs a rest," he mocked."I fail to see anything humorous in our present predicament," chidedthe Professor.  "We are many miles from our base of supplies, with oursupplies at the bottom of a gorge, goodness knows how deep down.Whether we can get down there or not I haven't the slightest idea--""Don't we get anything to eat?" wailed Chunky."Think you deserve to have anything?" demanded Ned."Don't be hard on him," spoke up Tad.  "He feels cut up enough aboutit as it is.  We've all done just as foolish things, only they didn'thappen to turn out the way this one has."Chunky turned his pony about and rode a few paces away from them,being more disturbed than he cared to have his companions know."Eagle-eye," called the Professor.The Indian was leaning over the cliff looking down into the deepcanyon, trying to find the pack mule.  He straightened up and strodeover to the Professor upon being called."You sure the mule is dead?""Mule no pack more.""Can you get down there to gather up our belongings?"Eagle-eye shook his head."No get um.""Why not?" interjected Walter."Pony fall in--Injun fall in," grunted the Shawnee."But can we not go forward or else back a mile or so and find anentrance to the gorge?" demanded the Professor."Yes, that's the idea.  Of course we can," urged Ned.  "We are nothalf as bad off as we thought.  Of course the mule is done for, but wecan divide up the pack amongst us boys and carry it all right until weget where we can either hire or buy another mule.  Don't think alittle thing like that will stop us.""How about it, Eagle-eye?" asked Tad."No get um.  Water him deep.  Him cold, b-r-r-r!  Pony drown, Indiandrown.  Mebby fat boy drown, too.""That seems to settle it," announced the Professor.  "We shall have tohold a council of war, as Eagle-eye does not seem to have anysuggestions to make.  What have you to say about it, Master Tad?""I think it would be a good idea to take a look over the cliff beforeoffering any suggestions," answered the lad, dismounting and tetheringhis pony.  "Perhaps the guide may be wrong."One look over the bold cliff, however, was sufficient to convince Tadof the correctness of the Indian's judgment.  He found himself gazingdown into one of those deep canyons that had been cut through themountains by water courses during hundreds of years.The wall on each side, while nearly straight up and down, was jaggedand broken, but so precipitous as to make any idea of descending itimpossible.  There was not a bush nor shrub in sight until near thebottom, where Tad discovered a thick growth of bushes on the edge ofthe swiftly flowing water course.A disturbed spot among these showed where the pack mule had fallen.That he had not gone on into the stream and been swept away was due tothe matted growth down there.  The others had joined Tad by the timehe had made up his mind that their guide had described the situationcorrectly."What do you make of it, Master Tad?" asked the Professor."Nothing very encouraging.""Whew!  That's a drop!" exclaimed Ned, peering cautiously over."Where is our kitchen outfit?""There, where you see the bushes trampled down.  What there is left ofit, anyway.  But perhaps the canvas wrapped around the stuff hasprotected it from serious damage.""Little difference it makes to us whether or not," answered theProfessor.  "The supplies are lost and that's all there is about it.We have scarcely enough left to carry us through the day.""No!" said Walter.  "Then what are we going to do?""I don't know, Master Walter.""We've got to get the stuff up here, that's all," answered Tad, with afirm compression of the lips."Then you'll have to borrow a flying machine if you do.  That's theonly way we'll ever reach the pack mule.  Why, it's a mile downthere--""Not quite," answered Tad."How deep do you think the gorge is, Tad?" asked the Professor."Oh, forty or fifty feet, I should say.  I hardly think it is deeperthan that.  But that is quite enough--"Tad, in the meantime, had been considering the problem, thinkingdeeply on the best means of solving it."Yes, I think I can do it," he decided."Do what?" asked Walter."Get the stuff up.""How?" demanded Ned sharply."Why, go down after it, of course.""Out of the question," answered the Professor, with emphasis."No, I think it can be done, if you will allow me to--""You mean, Master Ted, that you will attempt to get to the bottom ofthat gorge and bring up the provisions?""Yes, sir; I'll try it.""Impossible. I cannot permit it.""I should say not," growled Ned.  "If anybody goes it should be theguide.  He is an expert at climbing, I should imagine, and--" Tadlaughed."Why, my dear Ned, you couldn't even push Eagle-eye down there.  Forsome reason he seems to have a superstitious dread of that place.  Idon't know why, for Indians are not supposed to be much afraid ofanything.  I'll ask him.  Eagle-eye, will you go down there and try toget the provisions for us?" asked Tad, turning to the guide.Eagle-eye shrugged his shoulders, at the same time giving a negativetwist to his body."Eagle-eye not go down there," he grunted."Why not?" asked Ned."Bad spirits live in waters.  Bymeby come out and get Eagle-eye.""Oh, shucks!" jeered Ned.  "My opinion is that they wouldn't bother toget you, even if there were any such things down there.""Then there remains only one thing for us to do," said the Professor."And that?" queried Walter."Get to the nearest settlement as quickly as possible.""That would take at least a day or two, would it not?" inquired Tad."Yes, I believe so.""Then why not let me try--at least make an effort to recover ourthings?  Why, just think of the amount of stuff we are losing,Professor.""But the risk, Tad.  No, I cannot assume the responsibility--""I'll take the risk of all that.  The only danger will be up here.  Ishall not be taking any risks to speak of--""How do you propose to go about it, young man?""Simplest thing imaginable.  I'll climb down with a rope around me, sothat in case I slip anywhere you can straighten me up.  I promise youI will not fall.""The next question is, where are you going to get the rope?""I have one that is plenty long enough," answered Tad."You mean the quarter-inch rope?" spoke up Walter.  "That's in thepack that went over the cliff."Tad Butler's face fell."Guess you are mistaken, Walt," corrected Ned.  "You threw that ropedown when you were packing.  I picked it up and it's in my kit on mypony now.""Hurrah!" shouted the other boys.  "You can't down the Pony Riders."Tad hurried to Ned's mount, and, pulling down the pack, secured theprecious rope, which he adjusted about his waist carefully, the othersobserving him silently."I guess I am ready now, boys.  I'll tell you what I want you to do,so pay close heed to what I am about to say."CHAPTER IVINTO THE CANYON"Thaddeus, I cannot consent to this.  I--""Please, now, Professor, don't stop me.  I'm all right, don't you seeI am?""Yes, at this precise moment you are.  It's the moments to come that Iam thinking about.""Don't you worry one little bit.  Walt, will you bring me two of thosestaking-down ropes?  I want to splice them on in case this one shouldprove to be a little short.  Distance is deceptive, looking down, aswe are here.""What do you want us to do?" asked Ned."Hold on to the rope, that's all.""In other words, we are to be a sort of 'tug-of-war' team, eh?  Isthat it?""I suppose it is, Ned.""Then I hope we win.""I sincerely hope you do, too," laughed Tad."If I win, I'll lose.  That sounds funny, doesn't it?""What do you mean?" demanded Chunky, pushing his way forward."He means," Walter informed him, "that if he wins it will be becausehe takes a tumble to the bottom of the canyon.  Understand?""Oh," muttered Chunky, thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets.He stepped to the edge of the cliff, where he stood peering overcuriously."I hope Tad doesn't win, too," he decided sagely, whereat the otherslaughed loudly."Now, Professor, will you please take charge of the operations?""Certainly.  But, you understand, I permit this thing under strongprotest.  I am doing wrong.  I should use my authority to prevent itwere we not already in such a serious predicament.""Don't worry.  What I want is to have you take a few turns around thatsmall tree there with the rope, and pay it out carefully, so that Ican lower myself safely.  Don't give me too much rope at one time, youknow.""No," chuckled Ned.  "You know what they say happens to people whohave too much rope.""You mean?""That they usually hang themselves."Tad laughed softly."Please call that lazy Indian over here and set him to work.  Littledoes he care what trouble we're in.  See, he's asleep against a treenow.""Yes, his head would fall off if it were not nailed fast to him,"added Ned, striding to the Shawnee and giving him a violent shake."Wake up, you sleepy head!" shouted Ned in a voice that brought theIndian quickly to his feet."Come over here, Eagle-eye.  You're wanted," called Walter."Put the Indian on the end of the rope; and, Professor, you pleasetake a hold nearest to the tree.  You'll be my salvation.  The rest ofyou, except Chunky, can stand between the Professor and Eagle-eye."They took their places as directed, while Tad straightened out therope until it extended to the edge of the cliff."What do you want me to do?  Have I got to stand here and look on?"demanded Stacy."No, Chunky.  You may run the signal tower," laughed Tad."What's that?  I don't see any such thing around here?""You are it.""What?  I'm what?" answered the fat boy, plainly puzzled."You are the signal tower in this case.  That is, you will stand hereand watch me.  When I give a signal you will receive and pass it on tothe others.""What kind of signals?""That's what I'm trying to tell you, if you will give me the chance.When I hold up my hand, it means that they are to stop letting outrope.  When I move it up and down, it means they are to let out on therope a little.  Understand?""Oh, yes; that's easy.  When they shake their hand, it means you wantto go up or down," exclaimed the lad enthusiastically."O Chunky, you're hopeless.  No, no!  Nothing of the kind.  Listen.When I move my hand up and down, just like this--Understand?""Sure.""That means I want to go down further.  They don't wave their hands atall, at least I hope they don't while I am hanging in the air.  Now,do you think you understand?""Yes, I understand.""Repeat the directions to me then, please."Stacy did so."That's right.  See that you don't forget.  Remember, I'm dependingupon you, Chunky, and if you fail me, I may be killed.""Don't you worry about me, Tad," answered Stacy, swelling with pridebecause of the responsibility that had been placed upon his plumpshoulders.  "I can make motions as well as anybody.  Eagle-eye, tendto business over there.  Get hold of that rope.  Twist it around yourarm.  There, that's right.""Hear, hear!" cried the boys.Such self-confidence they had never observed in their companionbefore.  And then again, they were trying to be as jolly as possible,that they might not give too much thought to the seriousness of theundertaking before them."Chunky's coming into his own," muttered Ned.  "He'll be wanting tothrash some of us next.  See if he doesn't.""I think I am all ready now," announced Tad, casting a critical glanceat the men holding the rope, then taking a careful survey of thedepths below him.He was standing on the very edge of the cliff, a position that wouldhave made the average person dizzy.  Yet it seemed to have no effectat all on Tad Butler.He motioned for them to let out a little rope."More rope!" bellowed Stacy."All right, Captain," jeered Ned.  "Better port your helm, though, orthe rope will give you a side wipe and take you along over with Tad."Stacy quickly changed his position, which Tad had intended telling himto do.Without another word Tad sat down with his feet dangling over, thencrawled cautiously down the steep wall.  For a short distance he wasable to do this without depending on the rope, Stacy in the meanwhilelying flat on his stomach, peering down and passing on the signals tothose holding the rope.Now Tad came to a piece of rock that was straight up and down andperfectly smooth.  He motioned for them to lower him slowly, whichthey did until the boy's feet once more touched a solid footing.He carefully settled down until he was in a sitting posture.  He wason a narrow, shelving rock, and there he remained for a few moments torest, for the trip thus far had been exceedingly trying."The water's fine, Chunky," he called up cheerfully."The water's fine," bellowed Chunky, glaring at his companions.  Thena sheepish grin spread over his countenance when he realized what hehad said.  "I mean, that's what Tad called," he explained, amid a roarof laughter."He won't find it so fine if he falls in," muttered Walter."Bad spirits in water," grunted the Indian."Unfortunately for us, they're not all down there," growled Ned.  Buthis barbed wit failed to penetrate the tough skin of the red man."Tend to business, boys," warned the Professor, observing a series offrantic gestures on the part of Stacy Brown.  "What does he want, tobe lowered?""Yes, yes, don't you understand?""No, we don't understand motions in a foreign language," laughedWalter, permitting the rope to slip through his hands a little."How's that?" queried Professor Zepplin."More rope!" roared Stacy.  "Watch my signals, then you'll know whatto do.""What not to do," muttered Ned.Once more Tad began his cautious creeping down the uncertain trail.Though he had gone some distance, it seemed to him as if the bottomwere further away than when he started."I'm afraid this rope is not going to be long enough," he breathed."However, I believe I can crawl down the last fifteen or twenty feetif the line will only reach to them.  It's not nearly so steep downthere as it is higher up."There occurred a sudden sharp jolt on the rope, due to the men abovenot letting the loops slip around the tree while the rope was taut.This gave Tad a drop of three or four feet and a jar that made himthink he was falling."Here you, up there!  What are you trying to do?""What do you fellows mean?" demanded Stacy."Just a slip, that's all," answered Walter."Somebody slipped," shouted Stacy."Tell them to be careful, Chunky.  This rope won't stand many suchjerks as that.  Remember, it's running over some sharp rocks abovehere and is liable to be cut in two."Stacy transmitted the order in a loud tone of command, which theProfessor emphasized by a sharp command to the boys, at the same timeadmitting that he himself had also been at fault."Tell him we will not make that mistake again, Chunky," said theProfessor."Won't do it again," called Stacy, passing the word along."All right.  I'm doing well now.  Just keep the line fairly steady sothat I won't lose my footing."He was obliged to raise his voice now, being a long way down theslope, with the goal still far from him."Who would have ever thought it so far?" Tad asked himself.  "I'm surenow that the rope will not reach."Believing that he could obtain a better footing a little to the rightof him, he motioned for more rope, then raised his hand aloft as asignal that he had sufficient for present needs, all of which Stacyrepeated with more or less correctness.Tad had gained a broad, shelving rock this time.  Above him projecteda rocky roof that reminded him of the roof over his mother's porch athome.  It shut off his view of the cliff above him entirely.  Straightdown below him roared the river, here and there a spout of white sprayshooting up into the air, revealing the presence of a hidden,treacherous rock.It was an impressive moment for Tad Butler up there alone, withnothing between himself and sudden death save a slender quarter-inchstrand of rope.But though he felt the loneliness of his position, he felt no fear; hewas impressed with the solitary grandeur of it all.  Time waspressing, however, and he decided that he must continue his descent.Stepping back to his former position, he started to grope his waydownward.  For several minutes he made more rapid headway than he hadat any time before.He was congratulating himself that he would soon be at the bottom ofthe cliff, which lay about twenty feet below him.All at once he gave a gasp as he felt the rock crumble beneath hisfeet.  He had thrown his weight on a piece of crumbling limestone andit had given way.At that moment he had some two or three feet of slack rope, that hehad motioned to them to pay out, as the way was not now nearly sosteep.Grasping wildly for some projecting rock to break the jolt which heknew would come when he reached the end of his rope, and perhapsseriously hurt him, the boy was able to stay his progress a little.However, the pressure that his body threw on the slender rope was sogreat as to jolt nearly all the air from his lungs.Then Tad suddenly made another and terrifying discovery.He was going down.  He was falling.At the top of the cliff another scene was being enacted.  The suddenjolt on the rope had occurred just after the boys had paid out therope beyond the place where Tad had spliced it before beginning hisdescent.The strain was too great for it.  The ropes parted at a weak spot nearthe knot.The Pony Riders were too much stunned to do more than gaze upon thatwhich they believed meant the death of their companion.Chunky, who appeared to be the coolest of any, had been watching theknot approaching him with almost fascinated interest.  He wasspeculating what would happen should the knot chance to comeapart. And the very emergency that he was considering did happen."The rope's broken!" shouted the Professor.But Chunky had no need to be told that.  He knew it already, almostbefore they realized it.With great presence of mind, and an agility that none would have givenhim credit for, the fat boy threw himself upon the line that waswhisking over the cliff.Somehow he managed to fasten both hands on it.The boy began to slide along the ground with the speed of an expresstrain."Grab him! Grab him, somebody!  He's going over the cliff!""Let go!" bellowed Ned Rector.Stacy hung on grimly, perhaps not realizing the danger he was in.  Atany rate, he was determined to save Tad if he could."There he goes!" fairly screamed the Professor.Chunky slipped over the brink and disappeared with a terrified "Wow!""They're both down there, now," groaned the Professor, leaning againstthe tree and wiping the perspiration from his brow.CHAPTER VRESCUED BY A HUMAN CHAINToo much stupefied to speak, even to move, the other two boys stoodpale and trembling.  There was no doubt in their minds that both Tadand Stacy had been killed."Do something!  Do something!" shouted the Professor, recovering hisvoice in a sudden rush of words."I--I am afraid there is nothing we can do now," stammered Walter.But Ned Rector had bounded to the edge and was gazing over halffearfully."There's Chunky! There he is!" he shouted."Where?  Where?" cried the Professor, running up.  "Where is he, Isay?""Right down there, not more than ten feet below us.  He has lodgedbetween two rocks--no, I see now, he's caught on one."Now that they looked closer, they observed that he was hanging headdown, doubled over like a sack of meal, a sharp rock having caught inhis left trousers pocket, thus stopping his downward flight.It was not a very secure position at best."Are you hurt, Chunky?" called Walter."I--I don't know.  I think I'm killed.""Can you see Tad?  Do you know what happened to him?" asked Ned, in anexcited tone."No, I can't.  I've got troubles of my own.  Get me out of here quick.I can't hold on much longer.""If the trousers only hold out, we'll save you," cried Walter.  "Get arope, Eagle-eye.""Move!  Move, idiot!" snorted the Professor.  "What are you standingthere for?"Eagle-eye shrugged his shoulders, if anything more indifferently thanbefore."No rope," he answered, as if it were a matter of no moment."I'll get a lariat.  That surely ought to be long enough," saidWalter, darting away to the ponies."Come back.  There's no lariats there.  They're all in the pack downat the bottom of the canyon," shouted Ned."Then we're helpless," groaned the Professor."No, we're not.  I'll find a way to get the boy out," announced Ned,in a voice of stern determination.  There was no laughter in his facenow.  Purpose was written in every line of it."Come here, you lazy redskin, you," he commanded, which summonsEagle-eye obeyed reluctantly."What are you going to do?" demanded the Professor."Help!" came a wail from the unhappy Chunky."We're coming.  Keep quiet.  Don't you move," admonished Walter."I'll get a nosebleed if I have to hang here this way.""You'll get worse than that if you don't get a grip on yourself andkeep quiet.  I'm going to form a human chain, the way we used to do toget pond lilies at home.  Professor, lie down there, while I tie yourfeet to the tree.  We will use you for an anchor."In a trice the Professor's feet were made fast to the tree with theremaining piece of rope that had broken off short."Down on your stomach, Eagle-eye!" commanded the resourceful Ned,giving the redskin a jerk that sent him sprawling.  "Take hold of hisankles and hang on, Professor.  You next, Walter.  Good.  Now grab meby the ankles, while I go over head first."But Ned's carefully laid plans failed.  The human chain was not longenough to reach."Pull back, quick!" he ordered.The return, however, was less easily executed, and perspiring, weakand trembling, Ned finally succeeded in scrambling to the cliff, withthe aid of those behind him."What can we do now?" begged the Professor, greatly agitated."Try it another way, that's all.  We've simply got to do it.  Sit downand brace your feet against that boulder near the edge, there,Professor."This Professor Zepplin did quickly.  Walter dropped down in front ofhim, and next came the Shawnee and Ned Rector, each, save theProfessor, sitting on his knees, facing the edge of the cliff."Now each one grab the ankles of the one ahead of him," directed Ned.As they did so, the sitting men and boys, still doubled up, letthemselves fall forward on their faces.Slowly the line lengthened out like the unwinding of the coils of aserpent, Ned Rector slipping slowly over the brink, the red mansquirming after him, until both were clear of the edge, hanging headdown."I've got him," came up the muffled voice of Ned.  "But I've got arush of blood to the head.  Pull now!  Pull for all you're worth, allof you.  If you slip we're all gone.  Be careful."His words of caution were not needed.  Each realized theresponsibility that rested upon his shoulders, and each was bendingevery nerve and muscle in his body to the task.Eagle-eye himself was urged to renewed efforts by the certainknowledge that if he failed he would go to join the "evil spirits" inthe rapid waters below."Wait a minute.  I want to turn him around.  He's a dead weight thisway and I'm afraid we won't get him over," cautioned Ned.After much effort he succeeded finally in turning Stacy around so thatthey could clasp hands."Now brace your feet, Chunky, and help all you can."This Stacy did gladly enough."Don't drop me," he warned."If somebody doesn't let go you'll be all right," was the comfortinganswer.Walter, being weaker than the others, was by this time well-nighexhausted, but he held on with a determination that did him credit.At last they succeeded in pulling Ned and Chunky to the surface. Bothboys were thoroughly exhausted by the time they were hauled up, andfor a moment they lay breathing hard."Lucky my pants didn't rip, wasn't it?" grinned Chunky.  "Did you seeme fall in?  But where's Tad?" he exclaimed, suddenly sitting up.The Professor had already hurried to the edge as soon as he was ableto get his breath, calling loudly into the depths.There was no answer.  Then the boys added their voices to his, butwithout result.Tad could hear them call, but as yet he did not possess the strengthto answer.  When the rope parted he realized instantly that he wasfalling, and sought desperately to check his fall.  He was powerlessto do so.  However, the rope did this for him to a certain extent,catching here and there in crevices in the rocks, jolting Tad almostinto unconsciousness as he bounded up and down.  Finally the springingrope bounced him clear of the last jagged points, dropping him neatlyinto the bushes.Tad landed squarely on the pack that he had gone in search of, but theshock was so severe that for a time he lay stunned and motionless.When finally he became conscious he heard his companions far abovecalling.The lad tried and tried to answer them, to assure them that he wassafe, but the roar of the stream beside him seemed to drown hisweakened voice."I've got to make them hear.  I simply must make them hear," he saidto himself.  "They will be beside themselves with worry, believingthat I am killed."Finding that he could not raise his voice sufficiently to carry to thetop of the cliff, the lad struggled to his feet and began waving hishandkerchief.At first those above were so busy using their voices that they did notobserve the tiny piece of cloth.They had about given up hope of finding the boy alive, when NedRector, who had been anxiously peering into the gorge, suddenly raisedhimself to his knees."I see something moving," he shouted.The others crowded around him as close to the edge as they dared.They were able to make nothing of what he saw."It's Tad! It's Tad!"  He's signaling us," cried Ned eagerly."Are you sure?" asked the Professor doubtfully."Come and see for yourself," answered Ned, grasping the Professor bythe arm and rushing him to the edge."Be careful!  Be careful!  You'll have both of us over there, nextthing you know.""Judging from the experiences of our friends, it wouldn't do us muchharm," laughed Ned.  "There's Tad Butler down there.  Goodness knowshow far he fell, and Chunky got a bump that would have knocked thebreath out of almost anyone.  Hooray, T-a-d!"  roared Ned in answer tohis companion's signal.  "Are you all right?"The tiny piece of cloth waved more emphatically."What's the matter, can't you talk?"The handkerchief fluttered more rapidly.Ned interpreted this as meaning that the boy could not make himselfheard."I am afraid he is hurt.""Can't be very seriously or he would be unable to stand up and swingthat rag," suggested Walter."Looks to me as if he were trying to climb up the rocks," announcedChunky.As they gazed down intently they discovered Tad emerging from thebushes, slowly making his way upward."He never can make it," breathed the Professor, anxiously.  "He willbe killed if he tries it.""Trust Tad.  He knows what he is about.  He won't try to climb uphere," returned Ned."You'll see what he's up to in a minute."The lad's object in scaling the steep wall as far as he could was toget away from the roar of the water that was hurling itself furiouslythrough the gorge, so he could talk with his companions.After ascending as far as the formation of the rocks would allow, Tadperched himself behind a point of limestone and swung his hand gaylyto those above."You can't kill a Pony Rider," glowed Ned."Yes, judging from what we have been through, you young gentlemen seemto be immune to almost everything.  Of course there is liable to be afirst time.  We don't want that to happen.  But we have a seriousdifficulty on hand at the present moment.  Call to Master Tad.  See ifhe is all right."Ned did so."I got a pretty fair shaking up," answered Tad, in a voice that theycould catch only by the most careful attention."How far did you fall?" shouted Walter."I didn't have time to measure the distance," answered the voice frombelow.The boys uttered a shout of laughter."Neither did Chunky.""What happened to him?""He fell over in trying to catch the rope and save you.""Good boy!  Hurt him any?""No.  It hurt us more in getting him out.""Ask him if he found the provisions ruined?" suggested the Professor.Tad informed them that nothing save some of the cooking utensils hadbeen damaged.All had been too securely packed and wrapped with canvas to insurethem against exactly the kind of an accident that had happened."Think you can get the stuff up here?"  asked Ned."I'd like to know how?  The rope is all down here.  I can't very wellthrow the things up to the top of the mountain," replied Tad."That's so.  We had forgotten that," muttered the Professor.  "Andyoung gentlemen, will you tell me how Master Tad himself is going toget back?  Don't you see my judgment was right when I said it was adangerous undertaking?""It seems so," answered Ned ruefully.  "But there must be some way toget the provisions out.""Bother the provisions," interrupted the Professor, impatiently."We've something more important than food to consider just now.Master Tad is down in the canyon and from the present outlook he isliable to remain there for some time.  Any of you think of a plan thatwill help us?  Here, Eagle-eye, perhaps you can tell us how to getthat young gentlemen out of there."The Indian shrugged his shoulders indifferently."Him stay.  Spirits git um bymeby.""You stop that kind of talk," commanded Ned."Tad is calling," interrupted Walter."What is it?" asked Ned."Get a rope and let down here.""There is not ten feet of rope in the outfit.""Send for help then.  I've got to get out of here somehow.""Tell him there is no help that we could depend upon, within twenty orthirty miles of here," said the Professor.CHAPTER VIMAKING THE BEST OF ITThey were well along in the afternoon now and their predicament wasapparently serious."There seems to be only one way out of the difficulty," said theProfessor, after a little thought."What's that, Professor?" asked Walter."We must send for help, distant as it is.""If you will pardon my differing with you, Professor, we have help inplenty right here and a lazy Indian thrown in for good measure," saidChunky.The boys laughed and nodded their heads in approval."What we need is a rope, not more help.  Don't you think so?""Yes, yes.  I should have put it that way myself only--""Why not send the Indian for a rope?" suggested Chunky.  "I would gomyself if I knew the way.""No, you'd fall in somewhere," chuckled Ned."And the Indian probably would forget to come back," added Walter."Altogether we are in a fix.""I think Master Stacy's suggestion is the most practicable of all,"decided the Professor."Yes, but where could you send Eagle-eye?" asked Ned.  "It would taketwo days for him to ride to Springfield, and that much more time toreturn.  Tad would starve to death before that, wouldn't he?""Not hardly.  Altogether, the situation has some humor in it.  MasterTad is down there with plenty of food, but he cannot get up here.  Onthe other hand we are up here safe, but without food and cannot getdown to him.""If Tad couldn't get out, he'd be even better off than we then,"laughed Walter."We would all be all right in that event, my boy.  Come here,Eagle-eye."The Indian obeyed the command lazily."We want you to take one of the ponies and ride back to your friend'splace as fast as you can.  Get a rope, one long enough to reach downinto the gully.  Don't spare the pony.  Get back as quickly aspossible.""Him no got rope.""How do you know?  You go just the same and you go in a hurry.  Don'tyou dare to show your face back here unless you bring a rope, sir.  Ifyou get back before dark, I shall make you a present of this riflethat you have admired so much--""I beg your pardon, that's my gun you are trying to give away,"objected Stacy."Never mind, you shall have another.  Don't you think it's worth thatmuch to get Master Tad out of his difficulty quickly?""Of course it is.  I didn't mean it just that way.  Sure, give thelazy Indian my gun, give him anything I have, only do something tomake him hurry."The Indian's eyes sparkled with anticipation.  "You give Indian gun?"he asked.  "Yes.  Me ride um pony like fire from sky.""Well, get off now," said the Professor.  "We'll take for granted thatyou'll do your best.  But get back before dark."The red man was off with a bound, and releasing one of the poniesleaped into the saddle, plunging over the rough, rocky trail at a pacethat threatened destruction to pony and rider."They'll break their necks.  But he certainly is making time," grinnedWalter."Hope he doesn't break any necks until he returns with a rope.  Idon't care how soon after that he--""That's not a kind thing to say, even of an Indian," corrected theProfessor."Then I won't say it.  I'll just think it," laughed Ned."We have sent for a rope, Tad," called Walter.  "You must havepatience, for it may be several hours before he gets back.""Whom did you send?""The noble red man," interjected Ned, with a laugh."Then, it is more likely to be a week before he returns," sighed thelad.They could almost hear Tad groan.  However, there was nothing theycould do, and after talking back and forth for a time, the boyssettled down to rest, rather worn out from the excitement of the lastfew hours.Chunky, though, seemed drawn to the edge of the cliff as if by someinvisible force.  He simply could not keep away from it.Twice Ned Rector had hauled him back."Fall over if you wish to, Chunky.  I can't be bothered to watch youall the time," said Ned finally."I won't fall over.  Once is enough," replied Stacy, then they lefthim to himself.The boy, observing that his friends were not looking, began to tosstiny pebbles over.  He was chuckling with glee.  First he would throwone, peer over to watch the effect, then dodge back.  Stacy Brown'ssense of humor seemed impossible to satisfy.At first Tad paid little attention, believing that what he hearddropping about him was particles dislodged from the rocks overhead.But when finally, a bit of limestone the size of a chestnut hit thelad fairly on the top of his head and bounded off, he sprang up fromwhere he had been sitting, with an exclamation of impatience.Moving slightly to one side, Tad peered cautiously upward.  He wasgratified a moment later by a sight of Stacy Brown's red face peekingover at him."Hi, yi, yi, yi!" exploded Tad Butler.Just at this time Professor Zepplin happened to cast his eyes overtoward Stacy and, seeing that something unusual was going on, wentquickly but silently over to the boy."What's the trouble?  Anything the matter?" called the Professor."There will be if you don't tie Chunky to a tree or something," calledTad."We haven't any rope to tie him with, but we'll attend to the youngman," answered the Professor.  "See here, boy, what have you been upto?""I--I was tossing pebbles over at him," answered Stacy whimsically."That will do, young man," warned the Professor.  "I shall have totake you in hand if I hear any more such complaints.  Do you know thatyou might have seriously injured Master Tad?  Anything thrown fromsuch a height strikes with considerable force."Stacy hung his head, and thrusting his hands in his pockets walkedaway, after which there was peace in the camp of the Pony Riders forsome time."Every time I try to have a little fun I get into trouble," mutteredthe boy.  "I'll show them some of these days that Stacy Brown isn'tthe tenderfoot they seem to think he is.  I'll do something yet."He had already done so when he threw himself on the rope with the hopeof saving his companion from a terrible fall.  But, as usual, hiseffort had resulted in his own undoing."Got anything to eat?" he asked, approaching the group."You deserve to go hungry," retorted Ned."Looks as though he would, whether he deserves it or not," addedWalter."Young men, there are some canned beans in my saddle bag.  I carriedthem along in case we should become separated from our pack train,"observed the Professor."Hooray!" laughed Ned, tossing his hat in the air.  "I guess we won'tstarve this evening.  Let's cook them?""What shall we cook them in?" asked Walter."That's so.  I'd forgotten that.  Our cooking outfit is at the bottomof the gorge.""I think you will find something on one of the two remainingmules--something that will answer the purpose," suggested theProfessor.  "But first, I would suggest that you unpack your tents andpitch them.  It is plain that we shall have to remain here all night.""Why not throw Tad's tent down to him if we don't succeed in gettinghim up?" asked Chunky."Don't you think we've got enough to do with getting him and theprovisions up, without throwing down the rest of our stuff?"  sniffedNed.  "You must think we have an easy job ahead of us.  Well, if youthink that you're wrong; we haven't."They got to work at once, unloading their tents.  The canvas was soonspread out on the ground, ropes laid in place and folding cots placedwhere they belonged.  The next task was to cut some tent poles, whichwas quickly accomplished.  Shortly afterwards, the little tents sprangup, and the boys busied themselves with making them inhabitable.While they were doing this, Professor Zepplin had busied himself withgathering firewood.  He had trouble in finding enough dry stuff toanswer their purpose.  Walter remembered having seen some in a gully ashort distance away."I know where it is.  I'll go fetch it as soon as we have finishedhere," he said."Very well, Walter.  I have enough here to start the supper with."Having done all that was necessary to the tent for the time being,Walter Perkins ran off to get the wood for the night fire, while Ned,having found a spider, prepared to cook the supper.Out of the packs he had drawn a small package that looked good to him.He opened it and uttered a shout."Will we starve to-night?  I guess not," he laughed, waving thecontents of the package above his head."What have you found?" asked the Professor."Bacon.  Enough for all of us and perhaps some to spare.""Then, we are not so badly off after all, Master Ned.  How about thecoffee?""Coffee went down the hill.""The tea also?""Yes.  The whole business.  Neither have we any butter or lard.  Weshall have to cook the beans in themselves and eat them withoutseasoning.""Cook the bacon with them.  That will furnish the salt," suggestedStacy."Large head," laughed Ned.  "I'll do it.  Go fetch me some water."Stacy hurried away whistling, and in a few minutes returned with hissombrero filled with clear, cool mountain water."Here, here!  What do you mean?  Think we want to drink out of thatold hat?" jeered Ned.  "Get a pail; what ails you?""Nothing ails me.  It's the pail you want to find fault with--not withme.""What do you mean?""The pail's down at the bottom of the mountain with Tad," grinnedStacy."That's one on me," laughed Ned.  "Very well, go wash the hatthoroughly.  I suppose we shall have to use it for a water pail.  Agood scrubbing won't do it any harm, at that.""I did wash it," replied Stacy.  "Think I'd bring you water in itwithout doing so?""All right, put it down," said Ned, turning away."I can't.""Why not?""If I put the hat down the water will all run out over the top.""Then stand there and hold it till we get through supper," growledNed, turning to the fire where the bacon was frying in the pan ofbeans.Stacy eyed him questioningly for a few seconds, and then with anexclamation poured the water on the ground, jamming the wet, drippingsombrero down over his head."You go get your own water.  I'm not the cook, anyhow," he said,thrusting both hands into his trousers pockets and strolling over tothe other side of the fire, where he watched the supper preparationsout of the corners of his eyes."Serve you right if we didn't give you any supper," commented Ned."I'll set the table if you will agree not to find fault with the way Ido it," offered the boy."Go ahead. I'll promise."Stacy flirted the table cloth in the air, and after walking aroundseveral times, succeeded in smoothing it out.  He could find only twospoons in their kit, and no knives and forks.The boy pondered deeply for a moment, then hurried off into the brush,returning shortly, stuffing something in his inside coat pocket."Grub pi-i-i-lee!" announced the cook."Hey, Tad, supper's ready," shouted Ned, peering over the cliff."All right," came back the answer.  "I'm eating mine now.  I've gotcorned beef and--""And what?  It must be something pretty good.""It is.  What would you say to canned peaches?""Canned peaches!  Now, fellows, what do you think of that?  I didn'tknow there were any in the pack," mourned Ned."And you the cook!  I don't think you're much of a cook after all.It's lucky for us you didn't know it, I guess," said Stacy, with agrimace."Lucky for Tad, you mean.  Precious little of those canned peacheswe'll ever see.  Come, fall to.  You'll make me late with my dishes,"urged Ned.They were hungry enough, and the spiderful of beans and bacon lookedgood to them."What, do we have to eat with a spoon--a large spoon, at that?""You do, unless you prefer to use your fingers, Professor.  We are notallowed by you to do that, but I presume you can if you want to.Chunky doesn't need any.  We will divide the two spoons between thethree of us," said Ned, with a twinkle in Stacy's direction.But his levity did not disturb the fat boy in the least.  After havinghad his plate heaped with beans and bacon, Stacy calmly took from hispocket two sharp sticks that he had cut and trimmed just beforesupper.  On one of these he speared a piece of bacon, stringingseveral beans on the other, and carrying both mouthward at the sametime.The boys burst out laughing."Well, will you look at the chopsticks!" exclaimed Ned.  "I alwaysthought he'd make a good Chinaman.""Master Stacy is at least resourceful," answered the Professor, abroad grin on his face.  "I think I shall cut me some sticks just likethose."The boy stripped the beans from one into his mouth and extended thestick to Professor Zepplin."No, thank you," laughed the scientist.  "I think I prefer to get myown."Chunky solemnly chased a truant bean about his plate, finally spearingand conveying it to his already well-filled mouth.CHAPTER VIIBOY AND PONIES STRANGELY MISSINGAfter all, the supper proved a very jolly meal, now that they weresure Tad was all right.  Then, again, the beans and bacon werepronounced excellent by each of them, and Stacy had made fully as goodtime with his crude chopsticks as had the others with the tablespoons.Supper finished, all hands turned in to help wash the dishes, and in afew moments the camp was again in perfect order.Tad was informed of Stacy's skill with chopsticks, and they could hearhim laughing over it, even though they were no longer able to see him."Are you warm enough down there?" called Ned."Sure thing.  I have most of the blankets.""That means we freeze, I guess," interjected Stacy."You can go cut yourself a few chopsticks and sleep under them,"retorted Ned Rector.  "Hey, Tad, why don't you build a fire downthere?""Haven't any matches.""Never mind, Tad, the moon soon will be up and you can get warm bythat," shouted the fat boy."Chunky has suddenly developed into a wit, Tad.  I don't know what'shappened to the boy.  It must have been that fall over the cliff thatshook his thinking machinery into place.""Pity some other folks not more'n a million miles away wouldn't fallover," muttered Stacy."What's that you say?" demanded Ned, turning on him."I--I was just thinking to myself," explained Chunky, edging away.Ned was glaring at him ferociously, at the same time struggling tokeep back the laughter that rose to his lips because of Stacy's sharpretort."I'll make a suggestion, young gentlemen," said the Professor."Yes, sir, what is it?" asked the boys in chorus."Pile up all the dry wood that Walter has gathered.  Pile it right upon the edge of the cliff and light it.  I think that will make theevening more cheerful for Master Tad down there.""That will be fine," cried Walter.Quickly carrying the dried wood to the place indicated, they piled itso that it would make a long fire, then lighted it from three sides atthe same time.The result was a bright blaze that flared high, lighting the rocks fardown into the canyon, but not sufficiently far to reach Tad."Trying to burn up the mountain?" shouted Tad."No; we're trying to burn it down, so we can pick you up," called NedRector."Oh," came up from the depths."It seems to me that you young men are getting rather sharp with eachother," said the Professor, shaking his head."I guess it must be the Ozark air getting into our lungs," answeredNed.  "I've felt like having a wrestling bout with some one ever sincewe got into these mountains.""Wait till Tad comes up.  I think he will accommodate you," suggestedChunky wisely."You mustn't mind our talk, Professor," explained Walter.  "We saythings to each other, but it's all in fun.  We don't mean to be mean.Do we, Ned?""Of course not.  Chunky is the only one who--""Never mind Chunky.  He'll take care of himself," answered the fat boysharply."Isn't it about time that lazy Indian were back, Professor?" askedWalter."Yes, that's so.  I hadn't thought of that, Walter.  He has been goneall of five hours now, and the trip should not have taken him morethan three all told.""Suppose he had to stop to smoke a pipe of peace with his friend,"suggested Ned.  "Then there would be a certain amount of grunting todo before Eagle-eye could state his business, and after that muchtalk, talk.  That's the Indian of it.""You seem to know a lot about Indians.  Were you ever an Indian?"asked Stacy innocently."Even if I were, I couldn't be called a savage," retorted Ned.The hours wore on, and the moon came up in a cloudless sky, much tothe relief of the boy down in the canyon.  Just before dark he hadobserved that there was quite a strip of rock and sand on his side ofthe rushing mountain torrent.  It extended further than he could seeand the lad wondered where it might lead to.After a time he cuddled up, but could not sleep.  Perhaps it was theloneliness of his position.  Yet he had been alone in mountain andforest many times before."Hello, up there!" he shouted, pulling himself to a sitting position."Hello!" answered Walter."I'm going to bed.  Don't worry about me.  I suppose the Indian hasnot returned?""No such luck," answered Ned, who had come up beside Walter andreplied to Tad's question."And he won't be back till morning," sang the boy down there in theshadows."Right you are," laughed Ned.  "If he gets back then we are in greatluck.  I'll let the rope down to you if he should happen to returnduring the night.""No; wait till morning.  I wouldn't care to try to climb up in thedark.  I'd be likely to get hurt if I did.  You had better all turn innow.  There will be no need for you to sit up.""All right," answered Ned and Walter at once."I think perhaps Master Tad is right.  We had better go to bed.  Iwould suggest, however, that one of you roll up in his blanketsoutside here, so that he can hear if Master Tad calls," suggestedProfessor Zepplin."That's a good idea.  I'll do that, with your permission, Professor,"offered Ned Rector promptly."Yes.  Then Walter and Stacy had better go to their tents.  Ifanything occurs during the night, remember you are to let me know atonce.  If Eagle-eye returns, I want to know it, too.""Very well, sir," answered Ned.After replenishing the fire, determined to remain awake untildaylight, the lad rolled up in his blankets.In a few minutes after the camp quieted down he fell sound asleep; andhe did not open his eyes again until the sun peeped over the easternrange of the mountains and burned apart his eyelids.Ned awoke with a start.  He could scarcely believe that another dayhad dawned.He sat up, rubbing his eyes and blinking in the strong morning light."Whew!  I'm stiff in every joint," he mumbled.  "And sleepier thanStacy Brown ever thought of being."Ned pulled himself to his feet, yawning broadly."That's another bad habit I have learned from Chunky.  I wonder ifTad's awake."Peering over the edge, Ned was unable to make out whether hiscompanion down there were awake or sleeping.  He hesitated to call,knowing that if Tad Butler were still asleep at that hour of the dayit was because he was tired out and needed rest badly.Ned strode over to Stacy's tent."Wake up," he commanded, pinching one of the fat boy's big-toes."Get out," mumbled Stacy sleepily, at the same time kicking viciouslywith the disturbed foot.Thus encouraged, Ned pulled the other big-toe.Chunky rose in his wrath, hurling the rubber pillow on which he hadbeen sleeping full into the face of his tormentor.Ned, caught off his balance, tumbled over in a heap, while Stacycrawled back under the blankets, very well satisfied with the resultof his throw.But he was left in peace only a moment.  Ned recovered himself andreturned to the charge.  Over went the cot, with Stacy beneath it.From the confusion of blankets emerged the red face of the fat boy.Ned Rector thought it time to leave.  He did so, with Stacy a closesecond and the rubber pillow brushing Ned's cheek in transit.There was no more sleep in the camp.  Ned and Stacy's foot racecontinued until both were out of breath and thoroughly awake.  Thenthey sat down, laughing, the color flaming in their cheeks and eyessparkling with pleasurable excitement."I'll wake up Tad, I guess," announced Ned after recovering hisbreath.Going to edge of the cliff, he shouted loudly.  But there was noanswer to his summons.  Then both boys added their voices to theeffort, joined a few minutes later by the Professor and WalterPerkins.They were unable to get any reply at all; nor was there the slightestmovement or sign of life where Tad had last been seen."What can it mean?" they asked each other, all the laughter gone outof their faces now."It means," said Ned, "that Tad isn't there.  Beyond that, I would notventure an opinion.""Maybe he's fallen into the stream during the night and drowned,"suggested Chunky."We shall not even consider that as possible, nor do I believe it is,"replied the Professor.  Nevertheless, he was deeply concerned over themysterious disappearance of the lad."If the Indian ever gets here with a rope, I'll go down there and seeif I can find out anything," said Ned."Not until all other means have been exhausted," declared theProfessor.  "We appear to have lost one boy, and I do not intend thatwe shall lose another.""I wouldn't worry," comforted Walter Perkins.  "You all know Tad, andyou know he isn't a boy that you can lose so easily.  I'll bet myshare in the next meal that he's back here before dark thisafternoon."This confidence brightened the others visibly."That's right," agreed Ned.  "You can't down Tad.  I guess I'll gowater my pony and give him some fresh trees to eat up while some ofyou are starting the fire.  We had better eat, anyway.""What is there to eat?" asked the Professor."Beans, that's all, and not much of that.  Unless we get the stuffdown there, we won't have another meal to-day."The other two boys began preparing for the camp-fire.  Ned had beengone only a few moments when he returned on a run."Boys! Boys!" he cried."What is it?  What is it?" they exclaimed in sudden alarm."The ponies!  The ponies!""What about them?" asked Walter, pausing as he was about to strike amatch to the wood."Yes, what of them, Master Ned?  Has anything happened to them?"asked the Professor, striding toward the excited Ned Rector."Happened?  I should say there had--""Well, what is it?  Don't keep us waiting in suspense all--""They're gone!""Gone?" exclaimed the two boys in chorus."It can't be possible.""Two of them are.  They have broken away, I think.  It must havehappened late last night, for I looked at them just before going tobed, and they were all asleep then.""Whi--which ponies--which ones are gone?" asked Walter apprehensively."Chunky's and Tad's.""Is it possible?" sputtered the Professor, striding to the place wheretheir stock had been tethered."Yes, they've broken away," he decided, observing that a piece ofstake rope belonging to each had been broken short off.  "Look around,boys.  They cannot be far away.  Probably got hungry and concluded tolook for some tender bushes to browse on."The boys, thus encouraged, hastened to begin their search for themissing stock."They went this way," shouted Ned.All hands hurried to him."Yes, there's their tracks," agreed the Professor.  "Now follow them,but look out that you do not get lost."Instead, a few moments afterward, they lost the trail.  It disappearedfrom before them as utterly as if the ponies had walked on air fromthat point on.  No amount of searching brought it to view again, andafter more than an hour of persistent effort, the Professor called thehunt off, and the crestfallen party returned to camp."What are we going to do?" asked Stacy dolefully."I know what you are going to do," returned Ned."What?""You're going to ride a mule from this point on."CHAPTER VIIITHE INDIAN MAKES A DISCOVERYIt was not a cheerful breakfast to which the lads sat down.  It seemedas if nothing but trouble had overtaken them ever since they had beenin the Ozark Mountains.They had just finished when the Indian rode in on Ned's mount, whichhe had chosen for his journey.This was something at least to detract their attention from theirtroubles."Hey, you haven't got back, have you?" taunted Ned, noting the flecksof foam on his pony with disapproving eyes."Me back," grinned the Indian."I see you are," replied the Professor dryly.  "Where's the rope?""Yes; we don't care so much about seeing you, but we want that rope,"added Ned emphatically."No got um.""Do you mean to say you have been gone nearly twenty-four hours andhave not found a rope?" demanded Professor Zepplin."No rope," persisted the guide sullenly."Why not?" demanded Ned, steadying himself, for he was more wrought upthan he wished to admit, even to himself.The Shawnee shrugged his shoulders."Where's that rope?" snapped Chunky, with sudden new-found courage,facing the guide at close quarters."No get um!  No get um!" insisted the Indian, gesticulatingextravagantly."Yes, but why not, why not?" urged the Professor."No find.""You mean you could not find one?""He doesn't know what he means," sneered Ned.  "He's had too much pipeof peace.""Go take care of that pony," commanded the Professor sternly.  "Rubhim down well.  After you have done so, return and get your breakfast.There's not much for you.""He'll have to wash his own dishes," announced Ned.  "No washingdishes for a lazy Indian.  No, not for me.""Yes, he will have to do that," agreed the Professor.  "Come backhere, Eagle-eye."The boys did not know at the moment what the Professor had in mind."Two of our ponies got away last night, Eagle-eye."The Indian nodded, but without exhibiting any surprise."Did you know it?""Me know.""How?" demanded the Professor, with unfeigned surprise."Me see um tracks.  Me see um ropes there.""Well, you have got some sense after all,"' retorted the Professor."How do you suppose they got away?""No get away.""What's that?  What do you mean?" asked Ned sharply."No get away.""I guess the pipe of peace has gone to his head," declared Neddisgustedly.  "Now you say they didn't get away.  If not, they must beover there now.  How do you explain that?""No there.""Of course they're not.  Then they got away.""No get away.  Steal um," announced the Indian calmly.His announcement was like an electric shock to them."Stolen?  Stolen?  Is that what you mean?" shouted Professor Zepplin."Yes.""Oh, preposterous!  Stolen?  And with all of us sleeping within a rodor so of them?  Impossible.""Eagle-eye say stole," insisted the guide."How do you know?""See um tracks, then not see um tracks.""Well, what do you infer from that--what does that mean?"The Indian went through a series of pantomimic gestures to indicatethat the feet of the missing ponies had been bound with cloths so thattheir hoofs would leave no imprint."Come Eagle-eye," he commanded, striding off toward the bedding-downplace.They followed and gathered around him as he picked up the ends of thetether ropes."Break um?  No, cut um.""You mean the ropes have been cut?""Uh-huh," he grunted in gutteral tones.There was silence for a moment."He isn't such a wooden Indian as he'd have us believe after all,"grinned Ned."Can't you trail them?" asked Stacy.The Shawnee shook his head."Why not?""No leave trail.  Smart man.""Yes, there is no doubt of that," agreed the Professor.  "Have you anyidea who did this thing, Eagle-eye?"The Shawnee shrugged his shoulders as indicating that he did not know."Probably it was the same fellow whom you found fooling about the campthe other night," suggested Walter."Just what I was thinking," added Ned."Yes, no doubt he is the man.  But what we are going to do, I don'tknow.  It occurs to me that I might send some one on to Mr.  Munson,superintendent of the Red Star Mine, to whom I have a letter, askinghim to send us on a couple of extra ponies.""Does he know who we are?" asked Walter Perkins."Yes, he knows your father.  Mr. Munson is expecting us, and is toentertain us when we reach the place.""How far are we from there now?" inquired Ned."How far, Eagle-eye?""Two suns.""Two days, eh.  We could make it while Eagle-eye was going there andback.  I move that we wait until to-morrow.  Perhaps we may find Tadsome time to-day.  I believe he will return, as I said before.  If hedoes, we can start right on.  Some of us will have to walk, but thatdoesn't matter.  We are pretty well used to doing that, I guess.""Master Ned, your suggestion is a good one.  We shall adopt it.  Ipresume the other animals are safe.  The thieves certainly will nothave the assurance to come back again.""No come more," affirmed the guide."After you have finished your breakfast I want you to start in andlook for Master Butler.  You'll have to find a way to get down there,even if you have to wade in the stream--""Spirits git um boy.""We will leave that out of the question.  You find him, that's all.""He won't go down there," said Ned.  "He may say he will, but hewon't.""I'll see that he does," replied the Professor, with a firm closing ofthe lips.  "I have trifled long enough.  Now we shall do something.I--""Well, what's all the excitement about?" demanded a cheery voicebehind them."Tad!  It's Tad!" shouted the boys in chorus.With yells of delight they pounced upon him and for a moment there wasa regular football scrimmage, with Tad Butler at the bottom of theheap, the others mauling him about with shouts of glee.It was the Pony Rider Boys' way of showing their delight at the returnof their companion.  But Tad did not mind it at all.  Throwing themoff with a prodigious effort he scrambled to his feet, dust-covered,hatless and with hair in a sad state of disorder.Professor Zepplin had thrust the other boys aside and was grippingTad's hands."It's the last time you ever get me to consent to your taking such achance," he said.  "How did you get out?  You certainly did not climbup the side of the mountain.""Oh, no," laughed Tad.  "I knew there must be some way out, for Ifound a moccasin track down there in the sand before I turned in lastnight.""You must have pretty good eyes to find a moccasin track in the dark,"laughed Ned."I did not say it was dark.  I made the discovery before that.""Tell us about it," urged Walter."You didn't find any of Eagle-eye's evil spirits down there, did you?"asked Ned."No.  I wish I had.  I should have been glad of company of any kind.""We want to hear how you got out," spoke up Chunky.  "I--I came prettynear falling in after you, too.""Yes, I know.  Well, to begin with, before I found the moccasin trackI noticed that there was room to walk along by the side of the stream.When the moon came up, not being able to sleep, for some reason--Iguess it was on account of the water that made such a racket, Ithought I'd look around a bit.  After I got started I kept on goingand going, and the further I went the less steep did the banksappeared--""How far did you go?" interrupted the Professor."I haven't the slightest idea.""I presume you found no great change in the topographic features of--"Tad laughed good-naturedly."I was trying to get out, Professor. Finally, I found a place thatlooked good and after I had scrambled up some fifteen feet Idiscovered that I had struck a trail.  It had been in use not longsince.  What for I cannot imagine.  The rest was very easy.  I reachedthe top of the cliff just after daylight.""How--how did you find your way back?" wondered Stacy."I followed along the ridge.  After a while I saw the smoke from yourcamp-fire, then I hurried in and here I am.""You always were a lucky fellow," laughed Ned.  "Now if that had beenmyself I should have been down there yet, or else in the river orwhatever you call that stream down there.""Got anything to eat?" asked Tad.  "My appetite this morning is athing to be feared.""Depends upon how much the guide has eaten," replied Walter.  "I guessyou will have to lick the frying pan.""Yes, that's all he'll get," added Ned.  "Any fellow who has filled upon canned peaches and the like doesn't need any more than that.""Professor," continued Tad, "I would suggest that we pack up and movealong down until we come to the trail.  We can all then work into thegorge leaving the ponies on top.  It will be an easy matter for us topack the stuff to the top.  We'll be in good shape then.  Shall we doit?""Yes, yes," answered the Professor absently."Come on then, fellows.  I'll tighten my belt and save my appetiteuntil we get something like real food to eat.  Licking a frying panwon't satisfy my longings this morning.  I'll pack the ponies whileyou are striking the tents.  I--"Tad turned, gazing at them curiously.  They were strangely silent.The lad felt instinctively that something had gone wrong, for TadButler was quick to catch a suggestion."Well, what is it all about?  You are as solemn as a lot of owls atsunrise.  Anything happened?"Walter nodded."It's about the ponies, Master Tad," the Professor informed him."The ponies?  Which ponies?  Are they hurt?" exclaimed the ladsharply."We don't know," answered Professor Zepplin."Then what is the matter?  Don't keep me in suspense.""Gone," growled Ned dismally."Where?""I'm sure I don't know.  The redskin says they have been stolen--yourpony and Chunky's.  The trail has been masked so we cannot followthem."Without a word, Tad Butler hastened to the spot where the animals hadbeen tethered when he went over the cliff.  Silently he made a carefulinspection of the place."Well, what do you think of it?" asked Ned."I think I'll walk," answered Tad, thrusting both hands in histrousers pockets.  "But I'm going to get my pony back before ever Ileave these mountains," he announced quietly.CHAPTER IXHORSE THIEVES PAY A SECOND VISITTad was unusually silent while they were packing ready to break camp,but as they got out on the trail he became more talkative.  He did notrefer to the ponies again on the way, though the lad's mind wasworking rapidly."Do you think we shall be able to hire some ponies of Mr. Munson?"  heasked when they had been an hour on their journey."I have no doubt of it," answered the Professor.  "Perhaps it would bebetter to buy a couple.""I don't want to do that just yet.  There's the place where we are toleave the trail," he added, pointing to what appeared to be a broadgash in the rocks ahead of them.  "We shall have to leave the ponies,what few we have left.  I don't suppose the thieves will come back forthe rest of them, do you?""Hardly," answered the Professor.Securing their mounts as well as the two pack mules, they started downthe mountain side with Tad Butler in the lead.  On down the long,sloping trail they trudged until at last they reached the point wherethey were obliged to get down on all fours to clamber the last fifteenfeet of precipitous rocks.Eagle-eye halted, standing rigid, gazing off across the gorge."Well, what are you waiting for?" demanded the Professor.  "Comealong.  We shall need you.""Me stay."Professor Zepplin was angry.  He was for trying to force the Indian toaccompany them."I would suggest that you let him remain where he is," said Tad.  "Weshall need some one here to haul up the packs when we get them at thebottom there.  I'll leave my rope for him.""Very well, just as you say.  I hate to see even an Indian make suchan exhibition of himself," answered the Professor witheringly.  "Inever supposed there were such cowards among the red men."Tad handed his rope to Eagle-eye, at the same time telling the fellowwhat he was to do.  The party then scrambled down the rocks, soonfinding themselves on more secure footing by the side of the roaringstream.The mountain torrent was more of a reality to the boys now than hadbeen the case when they were gazing down upon it from the top of thecliff."My, I'd hate to fall in there!" decided Stacy, edging away from theflying spray that floated like a thin cloud along the edge of thebank, masking the torrent like a white veil."Wonderful! wonderful!" exclaimed the Professor, raising both handsabove his head, glancing first up then down the imposing mountaingash.  He was deeply impressed by the spectacle."Young gentlemen," he said, turning to them, impressively, "it wouldbe well for you to give serious thought to the remarkable region inwhich you now find yourselves.""Yes, sir," agreed Tad."We are not liable to forget it, Professor," added Ned."The Ozark region is unusual in having within such limited areas sowide a range of geological formation."Professor Zepplin in his enthusiasm was waxing eloquent, and the ladswere giving respectful attention."Perhaps you are unaware," continued the scientist, "that in both theeastern and western portions of this range, a section runningtransversely to its main axis presents a complete succession from theoldest Archaean to the newest quaternary."The Professor fixed Stacy with a stern eye."Do you follow me, young gentleman?""Ye--yes, sir," stammered Chunky weakly, shrinking back against therocks."And from perfectly massive rocks to the most perfectly stratifiedsediments there are represented a considerable variety of massesbelonging to different ages--a very complete section of the Palaeozoicand a rather full sequence of the latter deposits which reclineagainst the older strata.""Yes, sir," agreed Ned meekly."A-h-e-m.  And now having thus enlightened you, we will proceed withour quest for something to eat.  I trust my explanation has beenperfectly clear to you all?" queried the scientist, with the suspicionof a twinkle in his eyes."With all due respect to you, sir, I must confess that I didn'tunderstand a word of it," answered Tad boldly."I hadn't the slightest idea that you did," retorted the Professor,with a hearty laugh.  "Our friend, Master Stacy, appears to be theonly one of you who grasped the scientific truths."The boys shouted with laughter.Ned Rector proposed three cheers for Professor Zepplin, which weregiven with a will.Stacy, rather crestfallen, joined in the cheering, weakly, however."It is well to give thought now and then to more serious matters,boys.  After we are out of our present difficulty I will put what Ihave just told you into more simple language--language that you willall understand.  This is the most unusual country we have been in yet,and I want you to leave it with a pretty clear idea of the lessons itteaches.  How far is it to where our provisions were dumped?""It will take us an hour to get there, I should say," replied Tad."We had better be on our way."Tad tied his red handkerchief to a bush, so they might not miss thetrail upon their return, after which the party started out on its longtramp."If we were nearer to food, I should not take the time to rescue thesupplies.  At the present rate, it may be days before we reach asettlement.""Especially if we lose any more live stock," said Tad.Lost in admiration, the lads worked their way along the bank, gazingfirst at the swirling waters, whose spray here and there gave off thecolors of the rainbow in the morning sun, then up at the toweringwhite limestone cliffs above them."There's the place," announced Tad finally."Where?" queried the Professor."Just below where you see that projection of rock that looks like anIndian's nose.  That's the rock that I tumbled down after the ropebroke with me.  I am black and blue yet.  Don't think there's a spoton the rock that I didn't hit on my way down.  My, I got a bump!""Are the things damaged?" asked Ned solicitously."No, nothing to speak of.  I guess I did the most damage when I helpedmyself last night," laughed Tad.Tad, after finishing his meal, had carefully packed the stufftogether, and they now found it all in excellent condition.  The heavycanvas had protected the food and dishes in the dizzy fall, thoughsome of the cans had been considerably flattened."What do you say to having a real breakfast down here?" suggestedWalter."Yes, I'm hungry," urged Chunky."Oh, you'll get over that," retorted Ned."An excellent idea, but what are you going to do for a fire?"  askedProfessor Zepplin.They had not thought of that before."That's so.  There is no wood down here at all," said Tad.  "But, waita minute.  I know where there are some dead brush sticks a little wayfrom here.  Come on, some of you fellows, and we'll see what we cando."When they returned each had his arms full of brush and vines, all ofwhich they dumped in a heap on the edge of the rapids."It doesn't look very promising," said the Professor, with a doubtfulshake of his head."No, I guess it will be a quick fire," answered Tad.  "Ned, you getthe coffee ready and the other things so we can put them on the firethe moment we get it started.  I'll have the pile ready by the timeyou are."With considerable skill the lad arranged the heap, placing the deadleaves and the driest of the sticks at the bottom.  On top he placed amass of half green stuff, packing the whole down by throwing himselfon the pile, after which he rounded it up in a mound shape, with acircle of stones in the middle.The fire blazed up encouragingly, and Ned, getting water from therapids for the coffee, put the pot quickly into the ring of stones."Something's going to happen in about a minute," announced Chunky,with an air of great wisdom.  He had been watching the preparationswith hands thrust deeply into his pockets."What's going to happen?" demanded Ned, turning on him sharply.Chunky, instead of replying, leaned back against the rocks and beganto whistle.  In a moment the disaster that he had foreseen was uponthem.The flimsy pile of brush and vines, after the fire had burned away itsfoundations, gave way beneath the weight of the stones.  Coffee pot,coffee and stones went down with a crash and a clatter."Save the coffee pot!" shouted Ned, giving Chunky a push."Save it yourself.  I'm not the cook," answered the fat boy, whochanced to be nearest to the fire.  "I told you something was going tohappen."In the meantime Tad Butler had sprung to the rescue.  With onewell-directed kick he had scattered the brush and rescued the coffeepot before serious damage had been done to it.Rushing to the river, he scooped up a fresh supply of water, plantingthe pot in the center of the fire and heaping the burning stuff aboutit."We'll have some coffee after all," he glowed.  "I don't think Ned ismuch of a cook, do you, Chunky?""'Bout as good as you are at making fires to cook by, I guess,"mumbled Chunky.Tad laughed with them at his own expense.The water was soon boiling, however, and with the canned stuff laid onthe canvas which had been spread out close to the water, the jollyparty shortly after that were able to sit down to breakfast."Two lumps of sugar I believe you take, Professor?" questioned Nedpolitely, poising a handful of lumps over the Professor's cup."Give me four," interjected Chunky."You take yours clear this morning," retorted Ned."I got the condensed milk, anyway," jeered Chunky.  "No sugar for me,no condensed milk for you," and he planted the can firmly between hisfeet, which were curled up half under him."Oh, give him the sugar.  I have to take my coffee half milk," beggedWalter."All right, hand over the condensed milk then.  I'll give you twolumps," said Ned."Three," replied Chunky, firmly, making no move to hand over the milk.Ned let the lumps drop into his companion's cup, but from such aheight that Chunky had to dodge as the coffee flew up.He wiped a few drops of the coffee from his face, deliberately filledhis cup to overflowing with milk, then handed the can to Walter."I guess Chunky doesn't need any of our help.  He is pretty well ableto take care of himself," laughed Tad."Delicious," breathed the Professor, sampling his cup of steamingliquid."Who, Chunky?" asked Ned quizzically."Certainly not the coffee," replied the Professor in a tone ofreproof.The meal was finished with many a jest and the pack divided up intobundles so that each should have his share to carry, after which thelads took up their return tramp.They arrived at the mountain trail shortly before noon."Where's the guide?" asked Tad, glancing about."Probably asleep somewhere," replied Ned.  "He's almost as big asleepy head as Chunky.""He is not here, Ned.""Most unreliable guide we've had.  I shall dismiss him immediatelyupon our arrival at the Red Star Mine," decided the Professor.  "Youare sure he is nowhere about, Tad?""You can see.  He's not here.  I hope he has left the rope.  I'llclimb up there and find out.  No, he has taken it with him,evidently.""Here's the rope," called Stacy, hauling it from a clump of busheswhere it had evidently been dropped."Coil it and cast it up here," directed Tad.This done, he began hauling up the bundles that they made fast to itbelow. Finally, this was completed without accident.  All hands tookup their packages from that point and started along the winding trailthat led up the mountain side."Most peculiar, most peculiar," muttered the Professor."Maybe some of those spirits that the Indian was talking about came upand got him," suggested Stacy, with serious face."Maybe," agreed Ned.  "But I'd sooner think they would take you ifthey were the real bad spirits.""It is my opinion," declared Professor Zepplin gravely, "that thespirits that trouble Eagle-eye most are not the supernatural kind.  Wecertainly drew a prize when we picked him.""We did," agreed Tad, laughing."Next time we'll choose a white man, if we can get one--""Hello, he isn't here, either," called Ned, who was the first to reachthe end of the trail at the top.Tad, close behind him, cast a searching glance about."That's not all that is missing, either," he said sharply."What!" exclaimed the Professor."Two more ponies, that's all," replied Tad Butler.  "We are a smartlot to let him steal our stock right under our very eyes."CHAPTER XTHE PROFESSOR DISTINGUISHES HIMSELFThe boys uttered a cry of dismay."You don't mean--you can't mean they have been here again?""It looks that way," replied Tad.  "Both Walter's and Ned's ponies aregone.  See, the ropes have been untied, not cut.  The ponies surelydid not do that."The Professor was much too excited to speak for the moment."I am glad they did not take your mount, Professor.  That is one thingto be thankful for, anyway," said Tad.  "I don't understand thisbusiness at all.""Why, they must have been hanging about our camp all the time.  Theyfollowed us here," exploded Ned.  "We are a lot of tenderfeet.""Some of us," suggested Chunky."This is no joke," snapped Ned, turning on him almost savagely.  "Weare in a fix.""Yes, but we've got two mules left, haven't we," queried the boywhimsically."It's an outrage!" shouted the Professor.  "I'll have the law on themwhoever they are.  They shall suffer for this!""Yes, but first we shall have to catch them, Professor," returned Tad."It seems we were not misinformed when they warned us to be on thelookout for horse thieves.""In Springfield, yes.  I had no idea it was as bad as this.  Theycertainly can't get away without being caught.""I don't know about that.  But I do know that we have been easy gamefor the thieves.""Do you think they took anything else?" demanded the Professor."I don't see that anything else is missing, do you, Ned?""No.""See, they took off the saddles.  Didn't want them for some reason.I'm glad of that.  By the way, did they get my saddle when they stolemy pony last night?" asked Tad."No, I had your saddle in my tent," Walter informed him."The question is--" began Tad."The first question is, what has become of Eagle-eye," interrupted theProfessor."That's so.  I had forgotten about him," said Tad.The lads looked at each other questioningly.  The same thought was inthe mind of each."You--you don't suppose--" muttered Walter."Of course!  That's it!  It's Eagle-eye!" exclaimed Ned."Don't be too quick to accuse anyone, young gentlemen.  It is veryirritating, I know.  But let us be slow about placing the charge atany man's door, be he copper colored or white.""But, Professor," expostulated Ned Rector, "he goes away, and whileabsent from camp two ponies are stolen.  To-day we leave him halfwaydown the rocks and upon our return, two more ponies are missing, aswell as the Indian himself.  What can we think, but that he has hadsomething to do with our loss?""If I remember correctly, it was Eagle-eye who called our attention tothe fact that the animals had been stolen last night.  You thoughtthey had broken away," recalled Professor Zepplin."That's so," agreed Ned."It certainly does look bad.  If Eagle-eye had no hand in the theft,why should he run away as he seems to have done?" asked Tad."This is what is known as circumstantial evidence," the Professorinformed them.  "I do not say that the Indian is guiltless.  I amsimply counseling caution.  Wait.  We shall soon be at the mines, andfrom there, we can set the officers of the law on the track, which weshall do as soon as we are able to communicate with Mr.  Munson.""Yes, but how are we going to get there?" asked Ned."Guess we'll have to ride the mules," grinned Stacy."You may be a mule driver if you wish--I'll walk," retorted Ned."That's what we all shall have to do," laughed Tad.  "Glad the thievesdidn't take our guns.""And the food," reminded Stacy."Yes.  Probably they knew you had your appetite with you," laughedNed.In the meantime Tad had begun a search about the place for clues.  Hediscovered where the animals had been taken from camp, but, as in thecase with the loss of the other animals, the trail suddenlydisappeared a short distance from camp."They seem to have headed for the west.  We are sure of that much,"decided Ned."Which means nothing at all," answered Tad.  "They may have turned andgone back or else are traveling along ahead of us.  In either case wecan't follow them.  Do you not think we had better be starting,Professor?  We cannot afford to lose a minute now.  I want my pony.""And so do I--and I--and I," added the lads, one after the other."I think so.  Yet how are we going to find our way?  We shall belost.""No, we can't get lost, Professor," interrupted Stacy."Not lost--cannot get lost?""No.""Why not?" glared the Professor."We can't get lost," announced Stacy impressively, "because we don'tknow where we are, anyway."A roar of laughter greeted this assertion.  It did more than anythingelse to put the boys in a better frame of mind--unless perhaps itmight have been the return of the lost ponies."I am forced to admit the correctness of Master Stacy's logic,"replied the scientist, after their laughter had subsided."It seems fairly simple to me," spoke up Tad.  "The mountains run in asoutheasterly direction.  If we follow that direction we are bound tocome out somewhere--""In Arkansas or the Indian Territory or some other place," cut in NedRector."As I understand it," went on Tad, not heeding the interruption,"these gorges or canyons in the Ozark range follow the same generaldirection.  We have one right here by us, and we have the sun aboveus.  Between the two we should be able to find our way.""That sounds promising, Master Tad.  You are a level-headed young man,even if you do take long chances and do foolish things now and again.I shall adopt your suggestion and we'll be off at once."They were forced to pack some of their belongings on the back ofProfessor Zepplin's mount, while each of the two mules was subjectedto an additional load.When the packing had been finished there was little room for anyone toride, so Tad took one of the mules, Ned Rector the other, leading themby short ropes, and started off followed by Walter and Stacy on foot,with the Professor riding his own pony.The boys moved away with broad grins on their faces as they thought ofthe spectacle they were creating.  Yet there was none to watch theirundignified progress.  However, leading a mule and riding a pony weretwo distinctly different operations.  The boys were in a hurry and themules were not and over this difference of inclination they had manydisagreements.Once Ned lost his temper with the beast of burden that he had in tow,and used his crop rather too freely to suit the long-eared animal.The latter kicked until he kicked the pack from his back.Amid the shouts of laughter of his companions, his face red andperspiring, Ned was obliged to gather up the pack in sections andstrap it in place again, which he did after much endeavor.  Thereafterhe kept his temper."I've heard it said that a mule wouldn't kick after twelve o'clock,"said Chunky.  "Guess it wasn't true.""Perhaps it is after twelve o'clock at night that was meant,"suggested Tad."Mules are asleep then, aren't they?""Supposed to be, I guess.""Then that's it," answered the fat boy somewhat enigmatically.They failed to make any great distance that day.  How far they hadadvanced they did not know.  Shortly before sundown they called a haltat Professor Zepplin's suggestion.The mules went to sleep while the boys were unloading them.  Nedconfessed that he was nearly fagged.  Tad, on the other hand, declaredthat he had never felt better in his life."Hope they won't steal anymore live stock," said Ned.  "If they dowe'll have to pack the outfit on our own backs, which, after all,probably wouldn't be any harder than trying to lead a stubborn mule.I think I'll tie a string around the necks of the stock and hitch thestring to my big-toe to-night.  Then I'll know if anybody tries to runoff with them.""Run off with your big-toes?" queried Chunky."No, run off with the ponies, I said--I mean the pony and the mules."Stacy's eyes lighted up appreciatively."I've got a string that you can use," he said.  "I'll fix it up foryou.  Shall I?""You would like to see me lose my big-toes, wouldn't you?  No, thankyou, I'll furnish my own string if I decide to adopt the plan."After supper had been cooked and eaten, and the dishes washed, allhands gathered around the camp-fire, where they remained untilbedtime, which on that particular night was earlier than usual,because all were more or less tired after their active day.It was decided that some one should be left on guard lest they losetheir remaining stock.  The Professor took the first half of thenight, Tad going on at half past twelve and remaining through the restof the night.Nothing occurred to disturb the camp, for which all hands werethankful.  Tents were quickly struck after breakfast and once more theoutfit started out on the trail after having discussed theadvisability of bearing to the west a little.  Their final conclusion,however, was to keep within sight of the gorge.Two days passed as the little outfit crawled along over the roughmountain passes, down through broad deep washes and narrow draws.  Itwas trying work, but the lads kept up their spirits.  So inured werethey to hardships, by this time, that the unusual strain gave themlittle or no inconvenience.On the morning of the third day they had about decided to change thecourse and try to find their way out of the mountains as the quickestmethod of getting out of their predicament.They were gathering their equipment together preparatory to making astart in the new direction, when Tad startled the camp by a suddenexclamation of surprise."What is it this time?" cried the Professor, prepared for almost anysurprise."I see smoke!""Oh, is that all," answered Ned disgustedly, not at first realizingthe importance of the announcement to them.  "I thought maybe you haddiscovered the missing ponies.""Perhaps I have.  Who knows?  At any rate, don't you see it means weare going to meet some human beings at last?  We haven't seen one,outside of our own party, in several days, though we have good reasonfor thinking that one or more has been near us.""Smoke, smoke?" queried the Professor.  "Where?""There, to the southwest.""That's so, it is smoke.  It surely is.""Must be somebody's camp-fire," decided Tad, studying the wisps ofvapor that were curling lazily up on the clear, warm morning air."Indeed, it must be," declared the Professor.  "We must get in touchwith them at once, for they no doubt will soon be on their way.  Wehave not a minute to lose."The Professor began bustling about excitedly."It will be an hour or more before we can hope to get there with ourold local freight train," objected Ned.  "They probably will be gonelong before that.""Yes.  I have it," cried the Professor.  "I will hurry over there onmy pony.  You boys come along at your leisure.  Even if they do notwish to wait for the rest of our party, I shall be able to getdirections at least, and perhaps to hire some one to pilot us on tothe Red Star."This seemed to be good judgment, so the boys hastened to saddle theProfessor's mount, and in a few moments he was jogging away as rapidlyas the uneven ground would permit, his eyes fixed on the distantspiral of smoke curling lazily upward."Guess we had better follow as fast as we can," suggested Tad."Chunky, get busy.  What are you standing around with your hands inyour pockets for while Rome is burning?" shouted Ned Rector.  "Hurryup!  Take down those tents, pack all the stuff over to the mulesand--""And what are you going to do while I'm doing that?" drawled Stacy."Me?  I'm going to boss the job.  What did you suppose I was going todo?""Oh, that's about what I thought you would be doing.  I'll pack my ownstuff.  You can leave yours here for all I care," laughed the fat boy,sauntering to his tent without the least attempt to hurry."Don't tease him so," advised Tad in a low voice."What, tease Chunky Brown?  You couldn't tease Chunky with a club.  Ijust say those things to get him started.  He says such funny things."Nevertheless, the camp was struck in record time that morning, and thepack mules loaded so rapidly that they turned back their soulful eyesin mild protest."Got a new job for you to-day, Chunky," announced Ned Rector whilecinching the pack girths."What is it?""We've decided to let you follow along behind with a sharp stick andprod the mules so they will make better time.""Think I'll wait till after twelve o'clock to-night," answered the fatboy.They were off soon after that, but the mules had never seemed to moveas slowly as they did that morning.  Instead of an hour, more than twohours had passed before they finally came within hailing distance ofthe camp-fire.  For some time, they had been finding difficulty inkeeping it in sight, as the fire appeared to be dying down.Tad shouted to attract the attention of the campers or the Professorto let them know the Pony Riders were coming.  There was no reply,which caused the lads to wonder.So they pushed the mules all they could, a vague apprehension that allwas not as it should be, growing in their minds.  They soon came uponthe object of their search.  What they found was a smoulderingcamp-fire."The camp is deserted," groaned Tad.Not a person save themselves was within sight or sound.  ProfessorZepplin, too, had disappeared.CHAPTER XICHUNKY OBJECTS TO EGG WATER"Well, doesn't that beat all!" marveled Tad."Certainly does," agreed Ned."Yes, but I don't understand--what does this mean?" exclaimed Walter."I'm a poor guesser," answered Ned."It means that we are all alone," replied Tad.  "Beyond that I couldnot guess."Chunky had been viewing the scene with solemn complacency."We've got the mules, anyway," he nodded."Precious lot of good they'll do us," returned Walter."And we've got the food and--and I don't have to build a fire,either," added the fat boy."Yes, we have some things to be thankful for, that's a fact," laughedTad.  "My idea is that the Professor, finding the men had just lefthere, has hurried on to overtake them.  I don't think we have anyreason to worry.""Then we had better stay right here," answered Ned."Yes.  That is all we can do for the present.""Think we had better unpack?"Tad considered the matter briefly."I think we had better wait a little while," he decided."I think you are right.  I hope we don't have to.  We have enough foodin our pockets to keep us going until night and--""Don't we get anything to eat until night?" wailed Chunky."Not unless you can browse," retorted Ned.  "There's plenty of greenstuff hereabouts.""You can eat with the mules if you wish to.  I don't.""Might as well keep the fire up," decided Tad, gathering up a freshsupply of green stuff which he dumped on the graying ashes.  "Thesmoke will help the Professor to find us quickly when he comes back.""What if he shouldn't come back?" asked Walter, with suddenapprehension."Oh, he will.  Don't worry about that.  You can't lose the Professor."The boys laughed, then settled down to make the best of theirsituation, whiling away the time with jest and stories.After a time, Tad left the party and strolled from the camp in aneffort to determine which way the late occupants of the camp had gone.He was beginning to feel worried, but as yet had confided nothing ofthis to his companions.Examining the ground closely he found four distinct trails leadingfrom the abandoned camp.  These trails were fresh, showing that ponieshad only recently been ridden over them.  They all looked alike,however, and he was unable to determine which of them had been made byProfessor Zepplin's pony."Evidently the party, whoever they were, split up after leaving here,"thought the lad aloud.  "I'd like to follow out the trails, but Idon't dare do so.  The Professor would be liable to return while I wasaway.  Then again I might lose the trail and my own way at the sametime.  I've caused this outfit enough trouble as it is."With this, Tad slowly turned back toward the camp.He found a growing sense of uneasiness among his companions there."What did you discover?" asked Ned rather more solemnly than was hisusual wont.Tad told him."Then, there's no use trying to follow?""No.""What time is it?""Half-past three," announced Tad after consulting his watch."Huh!" grunted Ned.  "I guess the Professor has gone and done ithimself this time.""We'll wait," answered Tad easily.After piling fresh fuel on the fire Tad went over and sat on the bluffoverlooking the eastern slope of the range of mountains which theywere traversing.  Chunky lay stretched out sound asleep, untroubled bythe series of disasters that had overtaken them.Tad after running over in his mind many plans, none of which seemedpracticable, also lay down for a nap, and in a few moments the tiredboys were all sound asleep, including the pack mules.When they awakened the sun had been down all of half an hour.  Tad wasthe first to awake.  He started up guiltily, and looking around foundthat he was not the only one who had napped."Hallo, the camp!" he shouted.The other boys sat up suddenly, rubbing their eyes."Time to go to bed.  Get up!" laughed Tad."Nice way to put it," growled Ned.  "Tell a fellow to get up becauseit's time to go to bed.""Wat'cher wake me up for?" demanded Chunky.  "I was sleeping.""So were all of us.  First time I ever heard you object to beingcalled to eat.""Eat?  Eat?  Who said eat?" cried the fat boy, struggling to his feetwith difficulty, his head whirling from the effort of pulling himselfawake so suddenly."I did.  It's night.""You don't say," wondered Ned, looking around in surprise.  "I--Ithought I was back home in Chillicothe.""Dreams, dreams," muttered Stacy.  "No Professor yet, eh?""No.  I believe he is lost.  He surely would have been back longbefore this.""Maybe he's gone the same place the Indian went," ventured Walter."Where's that?" queried Stacy, at once interested."That's a conundrum.  You dream over it to-night," jeered Ned."We had better unpack and make camp," advised Tad.  "Chunky, Walt andI will do that if you will get the supper.""All right.  Somebody get me some water.""I will," said Walter quickly.  "Anybody know where I can find it?""There must be some near by.  Those other fellows would not have madecamp here and remained all night unless there was water near--""Unless they know no more about these confounded mountains than we do,you mean?" laughed Ned.After some searching about, Walter found a spring.  It was full ofwater that had a whitish tinge to it.  The lad tasted it gingerly,then smiled knowingly.  Filling his pail he returned to camp with it.By this time Tad and Stacy had unloaded the mules.  The three boys gotto work at once putting up the tents.  In the absence of ProfessorZepplin, they concluded to erect only two, and by the time this hadbeen accomplished, Ned was ready for them."Come and get it!" he bellowed.There was no table cloth, no table, just the bare ground, and the boyssat down to eat in the fresh, bracing air."No one who has not been camping for a long time can appreciatesmoke," announced Ned oracularly.  "If I had to go without my supper Ibelieve if I could breathe smoke for a few minutes, I could almostimagine I had a full stomach.""Well, I couldn't.  I've heard of smoke-eaters, whatever or whoeverthey are, but I want something a little more lasting," announcedWalter Perkins.  "No smoked smoke diet for me.""Nor for me," agreed Tad."What's a smoke eater?" asked Stacy."I should say that a Pony Rider Boy named Ned Rector was one,according to his own admission," laughed Walter."Pass the water, please."Walter filled Stacy's cup.  The fat boy drank it down without taking abreath.  No sooner had he swallowed the liquid than he hurled the cupfrom him and leaped to his feet coughing and making wry faces.They could not imagine what had happened."Slap him on the back, he's choking," shouted Ned.Walter Perkins, by this time, was laughing immoderately, while hiscompanions were jolting Stacy between the shoulders and shaking himviolently."Stop pounding me, d'ye hear?  Stop it, I tell you," cried Stacy,wriggling from their grasp, red of face, an expression of greatindignation in his eyes."Did you swallow a bone?" queried Ned."Bone nothing.""Then, please tell us the cause of all this unseemly disturbance.Your table manners are about the worst I ever saw, Stacy Brown.""Water," gasped Stacy."Here," twinkled Walter, passing the pail."What's the matter with the water?" demanded Ned."Somebody's been putting old eggs in it.  I believe you did that, NedRector, just to tease me."Ned did not understand what the fat boy meant."Here, pass that pail.  Is there anything the matter with that water,Walt?  You got it.""I think it is thoroughly good, wholesome water," replied Walter,holding his head low over his plate that they might not observe hisamusement."Ugh!" exclaimed Ned, after tasting the liquid.  He hurled theremaining contents of the cup full into the camp-fire."I told you so," nodded Stacy solemnly.  "It's eggs and they weren'tlaid yesterday, either.""You're right.  Walt, where did you get that awful stuff?"Tad and Walter were both drinking deeply of the liquid and apparentlyenjoying it."From the spring," gasped Walter, placing his cup on the ground."Don't drink that stuff.  It'll make you all sick," commanded Ned."Don't be silly.  That water is all right," laughed Tad."All right?  Call that all right?" demanded Ned."Call that all right?" echoed Chunky."Of course it is.  It is mineral water--sulphur water," spilling overhis clothes the contents of the cup that he was carrying to his lips.Walter was laughing so that he finally let go of the cup itself androlled over on his side, shouting with merriment."You can have it," announced Ned firmly."Yes, all of it," added Chunky.  "I'll take my eggs hard boiled afterthis.""Drink it.  It will do you good, Chunky," urged Tad."No, thank you.  I wouldn't offer it to a mule.""So I see," flung back Ned, with a malicious little grin appearing inthe corners of his mouth.  "But speaking of mules, I wonder if it hasoccurred to anyone that our mules might be wanting a drink, too.""Haven't they had any water to-day?" asked Tad."Haven't seen them drink since we left Springfield.""Why, of course they have had water every day.  They could not livewithout it.""If they're like me they could--if they had to drink egg water,"grumbled Stacy amid a loud laugh from his companions."I'll attend to them right after supper," decided Tad.  "But just nowwe had better talk over our own situation.  It is plain that somethinghas happened to the Professor.  How much longer will our provisionslast, Ned?""Well, on a rough guess, I should say not beyond to-morrow.""Then I should say in the first place that it would be wise to put theoutfit on half rations beginning to-morrow morning--""No, no, no," protested Chunky, springing up and waving his plateexcitedly."You won't have anything before you know it, young man," warned Ned."Yes, but we may have to stay here a week, if the Professor does notreturn.  I do not see what good it will be to begin starving us untilit is necessary," objected Walter."It will be necessary to-morrow," replied Tad."And after to-morrow what?""I shall hope to have some provisions here by that time, Ned."Ned Rector laughed."Yes, I can almost see it now.  How do you propose to get them, may Iask?""Go after them.""Where?" queried Walter."Red Star mining camp.  It cannot be so very far from here.""Going to drag the mules after you?" asked Ned in a half sarcastictone."No, I'm going on foot.""What!" exclaimed the boys in one voice."You heard me.  If Professor Zepplin has not returned by to-morrowmorning I'm off for assistance and a fresh supply of food.""And leave us here alone?" cried Chunky."Don't you see, fellows," continued Tad, "the Professor undoubtedly isin a worse fix than we are.  He may wander about the mountains untilhe starves.  I've simply got to stir somebody up to start out huntingfor him.  By remaining here we are only getting deeper into trouble.Don't you understand that?""Yes," admitted Ned.  "But, then, why not let us all go with you?""Yes, that's the idea," interjected Walter."No, that is not good judgment.""Why not?""In the first place some one must remain here to watch our outfit.  Wedon't want to lose anything more than we have."The boys nodded."Secondly, the Professor might possibly find his way back here, andthe chances are he would lose himself again trying to find us.""That's so," chorused the boys."And thirdly, as the Professor says, I can get along a lot fasteralone than if you are all with me.""Fellows, I understand why our friend Tad Butler wears a hat a sizeand a half larger than any of us--his head's bigger.  Yes, you'reright, Tad.""Yes, yes," shouted Walter and Stacy, "that's the reason.""And don't I get all I want to eat until he-he--until Tad gets back?""That depends upon how much you want.  Judging from past experience, Ishould say you wouldn't," replied Ned."But what will happen to us if you get lost, Tad?""Yes, yes, that's what I want to know?" questioned Ned."I'll see that I don't.""How?""This time I am going to blaze every tree I pass, with my huntingknife.  It will enable me to get back if I fail to find the way, andit also will serve to guide the men here, if I find any to return withme.""I take off my hat to you," exclaimed Ned."How many eggs have we left, Ned?""A dozen hard boiled ones, I think.""Then I'll take three.  I'll eat one for breakfast and carry the othertwo with me.  That will leave three apiece for the rest of you.""Oh, take a drink of water from that--that spring and save your eggtill you need it," suggested Chunky."I'm going to start early in the morning, so I guess I'll turn in now.Remember, you are not to leave this place till I get back--that is,unless the Professor should return in the meantime.""We promise," answered the lads together.After putting the camp in shape for the night and attending to themules the boys turned in and slept the night through without furtherincident.Next morning when they turned out, Tad Butler had gone.  On a piece ofpaper pinned to a tree they found a note reading: "I'm off, fellows.Bye."CHAPTER XIIALL GONE BUT TWO"Well," grunted Ned Rector, as he served the meager breakfast, "atthis rate there soon will be nothing left of the Pony Rider Boysexcept the skeletons of two mules."Chunky, solemn-visaged, was munching his hard boiled egg slowly, in aneffort to make it last as long as possible."This all I get to eat to-day?""Eat?  No, certainly not.  I'm going to cook all the rest of the dayfor you.  Let's see, you shall have a porterhouse steak, friedpotatoes, some nice fresh salad and a soup plate of ice cream and--""And a finger bowl," finished Chunky, without the suspicion of asmile."Yes, with egg water in it," added Ned.It was the longest day they had ever put in.  There was no differenceof opinion on that point when the day was ended.  They had hoped tohear from Tad before nightfall.  He did not return, however, and theyhad little hopes of his doing so now that the darkness was coming on.There was no merriment in the camp that night.  By dint of carefulmanagement they had saved enough out of their supplies to give them alight breakfast on the following morning, After that they had no ideahow they should manage, providing no assistance came to them.The mules were the only indifferent ones in the party.  They munchedthe green leaves contentedly, sleeping when they were not eating.Near the middle of the night one of the animals set up a loud brayingwhich brought the boys from their cots in quick alarm.  At first theycould not imagine what it was.  They tumbled out, shouting to eachother."What is it, Indians?" cried Stacy, dancing about in his pajamas."No, it's nothing but a mule with an overloaded stomach," answered Nedturning back to his tent growling his disgust."Wish it wouldn't dream quite so loudly," grumbled Chunky.When morning came, and still no tidings from either the Professor orTad, the boys began to realize the seriousness of their position."Something's got to be done, fellows," announced Ned Rector."I wonder if we could not shoot some game," suggested Walter."That's a good idea. But, is there any game here?""I heard an owl last night," said Stacy."We haven't got down to owls yet.  We may when we get hungry enough,"returned Ned.  "I think I'll take my rifle and go out gunning.""Do you think the Professor would like you to do that?" questionedWalter."I am sure he would not wish us to starve.  There must be some kind ofgame in these mountains that's fit to eat.  I'll shoot almost anythingthat comes along.""Don't you get lost, now," cautioned Walter."No danger.  And I'll bring back something to eat, you take my wordfor that."Ned, with rifle thrown over his left arm, stepped boldly from thecamp, heading west, reasoning that this direction would take him intothe heart of the mountains where he would be more likely to find game.An hour passed; then they heard a gun."He's shot something," exulted Walter."At something, you mean," corrected Chunky.A second shot followed quickly on the first, then a third one."Guess you're right, Chunky," smiled Walter.Later on they heard three more shots."That sounded a long way off," mused Walter.  "I'm afraid he isgetting too far from camp."Chunky nodded thoughtfully."He thinks he can shoot, but he can't.  I wish I had a fish line.  I'dgo down to the river in the gorge there and see if I couldn't catch afish.  Maybe I can fix up something that will--""No, you don't, Stacy Brown. You stay right here.  You would get lostbefore you got out of sight of the camp.  I don't want to be leftalone here, with nothing but a pair of long-eared mules for company."Stacy shrugged his shoulders and began idly cutting his name in thebark of a tree with his knife."Funny we haven't heard Ned shoot in some time," said Walter after along interval of silence.  "He must be working his way back.  Thinkso?""Nope," answered Stacy, still engaged with the knife."You don't?  Why not.""Hasn't got any more shells, that's why.""I don't understand.""He shot six times, didn't he?""Let's see--yes, I believe he did.""Well, that's all the bullets he had in the gun.  He'll have to throwstones if he sees anything else to shoot at."A startled expression appeared on Walter Perkins's face."You're right, Chunky.  But why don't he come back, then?""Lost, I guess," replied Stacy, not appearing to be in the leastdisturbed by his own announcement.Walter started up in alarm."You don't--you don't think--""No, I'm just guessing.""If--if Ned should get lost, too, it would be awful."Stacy nodded indifferently, Walter meanwhile pacing restlessly backand forth.The lad's face wore a troubled look.  With the Professor and all hiscompanions save Stacy, gone; with no food left in camp, Walter Perkinshad reason to feel alarmed.Chunky, however, whittled on undisturbed."Are you hungry, Chunky?" asked Walter, pausing in his walk, later on.Stacy nodded.The day had worn along well into the afternoon and neither of the boyshad had anything to eat since early morning.  Their appetites werebeginning to assert themselves."I'm going to get some mineral water.  It surely will help some.  Comeon, it won't hurt you."Stacy turned a pair of resentful eyes on his companion."No egg water for me.  I'll starve first," he answered, with morespirit than usual.While Walter went to the spring to help himself to the sulphur water,Stacy stood off to view his artistic work on the bark of the tree."Guess--guess they'll know I've been here, anyway," he mumbled."That's real good stuff," announced Walter, as he returned.  "I do notfeel nearly so hungry as I did before.  Better try some."Stacy made no reply to the suggestion.When twilight came on, Walter Perkins was more alarmed than ever.There could be no doubt now that Ned Rector had missed his way.  Stacyremained unmoved.  He bedded down the mules.  When he returned fromthis duty he carried something bright in one hand.  Walter's eyescaught it at once."What have you there?" he demanded."Can of orange marmalade," replied Chunky, with a twinkle.  "Guess itmust have been dropped out when we unloaded the pack.  Good thingthere's only two of us to eat it."CHAPTER XIIIWINNING THROUGH PLUCKTad Butler had left the camp at daybreak.  He started off at a slowtrot which he kept up over the rough, uneven ground until some timeafter sunrise, all the time keeping the mountain gorge in sight sothat he might not lose his way.He had eaten no breakfast, having simply taken a cup of sulphur water,believing that he could make better time on an empty stomach.However, he now sat down and munched on one of the three hard boiledeggs he had taken with him."Guess it will be a good thing to rest for half an hour," he said tohimself.  This he did, by stretching flat on his back, after havingfinished his scanty breakfast.Sharp on the half hour by his watch, Tad sprang up, greatly refreshed.Leaning well forward he dropped into a long, easy lope, which carriedhim over the ground rapidly.  Hard as nails and spurred on by the needof his companions, the lad pushed on and on, blazing his trail as hewent, not feeling any fatigue to speak of.  Now and then he wouldpause for a few moments to make sure that he was not straying from theriver gorge, which occasional rocks and foliage hid from his view.At noon Tad sat down and ate another egg."I must be getting near the place," he mused.Still there was no trace of human habitation.  There remained nothingfor him to do save to push on, which he did stubbornly.When the sun went down he seemed no nearer to the object of his searchthan when he had set out at daybreak.  The lad, after looking about,came upon a tree which he climbed in order to get an unobstructed viewof the country.  He argued that camp-fires would be lighted for theevening meal.  Not a sign of smoke could he discover anywhere.Tad's heart sank."I've got to stay out all night," he muttered.  "If I were sure offinding some one in the morning I wouldn't mind."There remaining about two hours before dark, he decided to push on aslong as he could see.  So he trotted on resolutely until the shadowsfell so densely about his path that he could no longer find his way.Tad reluctantly halted and after selecting a suitable place, gatheredwood for a camp-fire.  Water there was none, so he had to do withoutit while he ate his last egg.Then he lay down to sleep, refusing to allow himself to think verylong at a time of his lonely position.Late that night, the boy awakened, finding the moon shining brightly.He got up and looked about him.  The camp-fire had died out.  Thelight of the moon was so strong that he could make out thesurroundings almost as well as in daylight."I may as well go on," he decided.  "Perhaps I'll get somewhere intime for breakfast.  If I don't I surely will have no breakfast, for Ihaven't a scrap of food left."So he trudged on.  He did not run this time, for a little more carethan he had been exercising was now necessary to avoid pitfalls in theshadows cast by rock and tree.Daylight came, but still the weary boy kept on his way.  Hungry?  Yes,Tad was actually faint for want of food.  He tried the experiment ofchewing some leaves that he knew were harmless.  At first this gavehim some relief.  After a little it made him sick, so he did not trythe experiment again.  He feared he was going to give out.Toward eleven o'clock the boy came out upon a rise of groundoverlooking a long slope.  He rubbed his eyes almost unbelievingly.Halfway down the slope was a shack and off beyond it stood a man withhis back turned toward him.Tad uttered a shout of joy and began leaping down the incline.  Theman down there, startled by the cry, wheeled suddenly and descryingthe figure of Tad Butler racing toward him, ran to his cabin,appearing a moment later with a rifle in his hands.A moment more a second man dashed out, he too carrying a gun.  Bothmen stood facing the lad, until, when he got near enough, theydiscovered that it was a boy; then they laughed and lowered theirweapons.Tad fairly staggered up to them."Act as if ye'd seen a ghost, young feller.  What's the excitementabout?" demanded the first of the two men.Tad explained as best he could between breaths, at which the menlaughed more heartily than ever."I want something to eat first of all.  I'm half starved," he toldthem."Sorry, younker, but we ain't got more'n enough for ourselves.  It's along ways to where we kin git more.""But I am willing to pay you for it.  I must have food right now,"protested Tad."So must we.""Who are you?" demanded Tad indignantly.  "I didn't suppose there wasa man mean enough to refuse a boy at least a piece of bread when thatboy was starving.""We're prospecting.  I reckon we know our business best.  Ye can't getany chuck out of this outfit.""Then tell me where the Red Star Mine is.  I've got to get there atonce.""She's nigh onto fifteen miles off thar--""Why, that's the direction I came from," exclaimed the lad."Sure. Ye must have dodged it.  Did ye pass the Ruby Mounting?""I don't know.  Where is it?" asked Tad Butler."You'd know if ye saw it once.  It's a peak that looks red when thesun shines on it.""No, I didn't pass the place.  Tell me how I can get to the miningcamp, even if you won't let me have anything to eat," begged the boy."My companions will starve before I can get back unless I get help tothem soon.""Got a compass?""Yes.""Then lay yer course north by northwest three p'ints and ye'll hit theRed Star plumb in the eye--if ye don't miss it," and the miner laughedcoarsely.  "Know anybody there?""Mr. Munson, Richard Munson.""Dick Munson, eh?" returned the man, with increasing interest."I'll be going now.  Much obliged for directing me, at least," saidTad, turning away and starting with compass in hand.The men said something to each other in a low tone, but Tad paid noattention to them, hurrying away as fast as his weary limbs wouldcarry him."Hey, young feller, come back here."Tad did so reluctantly."Sorry we can't give ye anything to eat.  My pardner and I reckonthough that ye can milk the goat if ye want to.""The goat?""Yep.  The goat's our milk wagon--she gives milk for the outfit."At first he thought they were joking, but Tad suddenly realized thatthe men were in earnest."I--I never milked a goat," he replied hesitatingly."Well, if yer hungry enough ye'll try.""Where is the goat?""Oh, I dunno.  Browsing hereabouts, I reckon.  Look her up if ye wantto. We ain't got time.""Thank you. I'll try.""Mebby you'll find her over in that little draw there to the left,"suggested the miner.Tad sought the draw and after some search came upon the goat ratherunexpectedly.  The animal gazed at him suspiciously and moved off whenhe spoke to her.Tad coaxed without avail, until finally with a handful of greenleaves, that he had pulled from a branch above his head, he managed toexcite the animal's interest.  While she was nibbling at his offering,Tad patted her and after a time managed to quiet her sufficiently toenable him to get around to one side.He had milked cows, but this was his first experience at milking agoat.  As a result the lad went about his task rather awkwardly.Holding his cup with the left hand and using the right, he soon filledthe cup, gulping down the contents greedily."Gracious, that tastes good!" gasped the boy.  "I never knew goat'smilk was anything like that.  I suppose I can take all I want."He helped himself to another and still another cupful, until he feltthat he could hold no more."Thank you, Mrs. Goat," he soothed, patting the animal, while she inturn rubbed her nose against his sleeve as much as to say, "You'rewelcome.  Help yourself if you wish any more.""No, thank you, I think I have plenty, but you shall have some moregreen leaves."Tad pulled down branch after branch which he piled up in front of thegoat, and which she attacked with vigorous nibbles and tugs.Very much refreshed, the boy ran back to the miners' shack."How much do I owe you?" he asked."Don't owe us nuthin'.""Well, here is twenty-five cents.  I thank you very much," replied thelad, laying the money down in front of the door of the shack, becausethe miner refused to reach out his hand for it."You're welcome, kid.  Mebby we might squeeze out a chunk of breadafter all.""I think I have had plenty.  I do not feel hungry now," he smiled."How far is it to the Red Star the way you have directed me?""As the eagle flies, 'bout twelve miles.  You'll make it in fifteen,cause you'll have to go around a draw that you can't get through.When you get round the draw just come back till ye git on yer courseagain," directed the miner."Thank you.  Good-bye.  Hope I have a chance to return the favor sometime," smiled Tad, swinging his hand in parting salute, as he startedwith renewed courage.The fifteen miles of rough traveling did not discourage him in theleast.  He reasoned that he ought to reach the mining camp by four orfive o'clock that afternoon.  That would be in time for him to startback with food for the other boys, whom he had left in camp."My, but I'll bet Chunky is a walking skeleton by this time," smiledTad, as the thought of his companion's appetite came humorously intohis mind.Talking to himself to keep up his courage, consulting his compassfrequently, that he might not stray from the course in the least, thelad hurried on.  Reaching the draw that the miners had described, herecognized it at once, worked his way around it and came back.  Hemight have shortened the journey had he but known how to work out hiscourse by the compass.  Tad realized this.  He told himself that hecould not afford to try any experiment, however.His judgment was verified, when, shortly after four o'clock he wasgratified by sighting several pillars of black smoke."That's the place.  I've hit it!" exulted the lad, breaking into asharp trot, which he increased until he was running at top speed.With clothes in a sad state of disorder, eyes red and sunken, TadButler burst into the Red Star mining camp.  His sudden entrancecaused the few people about to pause and gaze at him in astonishment."Where's Mr. Munson--Mr. Richard Munson?  I must see him at once," heasked of one of these."He ain't here.""What!  Not here?""No.""Then where is he? I must find him," expostulated the lad."Reckon you'll have a long run, then.  He's gone over to the Mearsmines.  That's a good twenty miles from here, I reckon."Tad groaned in his disappointment, and sitting down on a rock, buriedhis head in his hands.CHAPTER XIVRESCUE PARTIES ON THE TRAIL"Who is in charge in his place?  There must be some one that I cantalk to," demanded the lad, starting to his feet."Might see Tom Phipps, the assistant superintendent.""Where is he?  Tell me quickly.""See that shack over there?""Yes.""Well, if he ain't there, he's somewhere else.""Thank you," said Tad, unheeding the fling.Tad started for the shack at top speed.  He burst into the place,which proved to be office and sleeping place as well, without eventhinking to knock, so excited was he.A young man, who sat studying a map, glanced up in surprise."Mr. Phipps--Mr. Thomas Phipps, I want," said Tad."I am he.""I beg your pardon for my seeming rudeness, sir, but I'm in an awfulhurry.""So I have observed," smiled the young man.  "What is it--is theresomething I can do for you?""Indeed there is.  I had hoped to find Mr. Munson, as he would knowwho I am.  You do not, but I am going to ask a very great favor ofyou--""Perhaps I may know, if you will tell me," smiled Phipps."I am Tad Butler, one of the Pony Rider Boys, and we're in an awfulfix.""Shake," nodded the assistant superintendent, extending his hand.  "Ofcourse I know about you.  Dick has told me about your trips thissummer and he's been expecting you almost any time now.  When he leftthis morning he charged me to be on the lookout for you.  Where's therest of your party?""I'm afraid most of them are in trouble.""Tell me about it."Tad related in detail all that occurred since they left Springfield,not omitting the sudden disappearance of the Indian, nor the loss ofthe ponies."So you've been hit too, eh?  You are not the only ones who have loststock. It's getting to be a common thing in this part of the country.Nor do they confine their depredations to stealing horses.  They helpthemselves liberally to whatever they happen to want.  It's never seenagain.  They have some secret method of smuggling their plunder fromthe range that we can't discover," continued Phipps breezily."I am most concerned just now with getting food to my companions andhaving some one start out for the Professor," urged Tad."Yes, I'm thinking that over.  There are not many ponies in camp here.We had more, but the same thing happened to them that did to yours,"said the young miner.  "I think Munson is planning to make a round-upof the country with the idea of breaking up the band.  You stay herewhile I go out and see what I can do about it.  By the way, have youhad anything to eat?" asked Phipps suddenly.Tad told him honestly what he had had."Three eggs and a drink of nanny goat milk, eh?  Not much to travelmore than thirty miles on.  Can you cook?""After a fashion," admitted Tad."Then get to work.  There's bacon.  You'll find bread and butter inthe large tin box there.  Help yourself.  I would cook it for you onlyI would rather get things going for your friends," said Phippscordially.Tad protested that he could help himself and urged the miner to makeall haste possible.  After the latter had left him, the lad lost notime in starting the fire and in a few moments had bacon sizzling inthe spider and the coffee pot steaming.  He found some cold potatoeswhich he fried in the grease of the bacon."Don't that smell good!" exclaimed Tad, as the odor of the cookingdrifted up to his nostrils.  "If it tastes half as good as it smellsI'll have the meal of my life."He was not disappointed.  Tad ate and ate, yet he was wise enough torestrain himself and chew his food well, knowing full well that hewould have to submit himself to a still further test of endurancebefore he could call his work done.The lad was still eating when Tom Phipps returned."What luck?" cried Tad anxiously."It's all right.  I've rounded up enough ponies for the party.  I havecalled six of the miners from work.  They are men who know themountains.  The cook in the chuck house is preparing food for you totake back with you--that is if you intend to go--""Of course I do," spoke up Tad quickly."I think it will be best for the whole party to return with you to theplace where your friends are camped.  From that point they can starton the trail.  They'll find the Professor.  No doubt about that.After you all get back we will talk with you about the loss of yourstock.  Perhaps your experience may help us to land the band. I hopeso.""Can--can your men find their way in the dark?""I should say they could.  Some of them know now from my descriptionjust where your camp is.  Don't worry about that.  Here they comenow."The miners, leading an extra pony for Tad, rode up at that moment.When they glanced at the slight, boyish figure of Tad Butler they wereof the opinion that he had best remain at the mining camp.  They didnot believe him hardy enough to stand the grilling journey that laybefore them.They changed their minds before they had been out of camp an hour.Tad rode well up with the leader, sitting in his saddle like aveteran, taking obstructions in their path with jumps that some of theparty balked at and rode around."Say, kid, where'd you learn to hit a saddle like that?" called one."Does my riding please you?" inquired Tad."I should say it did.  You are no tenderfoot."Though the party rode rapidly, the hour was late when they reached thevicinity of the Pony Rider Boys camp.  Having approached the placefrom another direction, Tad did not know where he was."It must be somewhere hereabouts," decided the leader.  "Can't youremember whether it was to the north or the south of this?""Which way is the gorge?" asked Tad."That way.  Lays right the other side of those rocks."Tad considered for a moment."Wait," he said, a sudden idea coming to him.  "I do not remember thisparticular spot, but when I left the camp I blazed trees all along soI could find my way back.  If there are any marks on the trees here, Imade them."The men leaped from their ponies and began examining the trees, fromthe cliff back several rods.  Not a sign of fresh blazing were theyable to discover."There's nothing here," announced the leader."Then I didn't go this way," answered Tad, with a note of finality inhis tone."We are too far to the north, boys.  Turn around and follow thecanyon."This they did until they had proceeded for something like half anhour, when the leader of the rescue party decided to get down againand examine the trees."Here's a blaze.  Is that yours, kid?" he exclaimed.Tad examined the mark on the tree carefully, having first lighted amatch to aid him."Yes, yes; I did that.""Then we've gone by the place.  There can't be anybody there or wewould have seen the camp-fire.""They must be there!  Let's go back over the ground!" exclaimed Tad.The men turned about without another word.  After a few moments hadpassed Tad began calling loudly.Soon a shout just ahead of them told the party that at last they hadfound that which they were in search of.Tad uttered a glad cry."Where are you?""Here," answered the voice of Stacy Brown.Tad put spurs to his pony and dashed up to where he thought the voicehad come from."Where are the rest of the boys?""Got anything to eat?" asked Chunky, rousing himself to fullwakefulness."Yes, plenty.  But where's Ned and Walter?  Are they asleep?"insisted Tad Butler half fearfully."I don't know.""What do you mean?""Ned went off to hunt some game because we didn't have anything toeat.  He hasn't come back.  Walt got crazy about it and I guess hewent out to look for him, though he didn't tell me he was going to--""What time was that?" interrupted Tad."When Ned went away?""No, when did Walter leave?""I don't know.  It was somewhere about sundown when I saw him last.""Which way do you think he went?""That way, I guess," replied Chunky, pointing.By this time the men had lighted the fire."Give that boy something to eat right now," commanded the leader themoment he set eyes on Stacy.  "He's half starved.  He can hardlystand."They opened the package of food at once, giving the once fat boy alittle at a time at first and compelling him to eat slowly."Then there is not one of them here but Chunky," muttered Tad."No--nobody but me and the mules," answered Stacy quickly.No one thought of laughing."Are we not going out to look for the others now?" asked Tad."Yes, I reckon we might as well," decided the leader.  "We'll leaveyour friend here till morning.  One of our men will remain here withhim.  At daylight they will start for the Red Star.  If anything hasbeen heard there of the folks we are looking for, they can then sendword back to us so we don't spend the rest of our lives hunting forthem."His plan seemed a logical one to Tad.  The party was to spread out,covering a large area, literally dragging the mountains with a humannet, it being agreed that when one made a discovery he was to informthe others by shooting twice into the air.After having received their instructions the men quickly rode away.The moon had come out, lighting the way and making their journey mucheasier.Stacy gave no further heed to the miner who had been left in charge ofhim, and promptly went to sleep on a full stomach.  He had notexperienced that agreeable sensation for some time.The night was well advanced when two sharp reports from the south toldthe searchers that some of their party had gained tidings of theabsent ones.Each man wheeled sharply about and raced for the camp as rapidly asthe rough trail would permit, arriving there about the time theirleader rode in with Walter Perkins.  He had found the lad less thanhalf a mile from camp.  Beyond being very badly frightened, Walterseemed none the worse for his experience.  Instead of having followedthe direction in which he had started, Walter had gradually wornaround to the north until finally he was headed back toward theiroriginal starting point.In a short time he realized that he was lost.  He called loudly forhelp, but as there was no one to hear his cries, he had at last thrownhimself down on the ground in despair to wait for morning.It was there that the leader of the rescue party had stumbled uponhim, Walter having heard and answered his hail."That's one.  Spread out again, boys.  We'll rope the rest of theyoungsters before morning.  They can't be far away.  The Professor, asthey call him, has a horse, and there's no telling where he is by thistime."But the task they had set for themselves this time, was not quite soeasy of accomplishment.CHAPTER XVTHE ROUND UPSome miles from the camp the searchers next morning came upon anabandoned camp where there had been a fire and where, from the bonesfound there, they decided some one had eaten a rabbit."We're on the trail," said the leader.  "We'll get him yet."An hour later one of the men reported that he had picked up arepeating rifle with the magazine empty.  When Tad joined them later,he identified the weapon as having been the one used by Ned Rector.The course he was taking, if followed, would eventually take him outof the mountains into the open country.  Perhaps through someinstinct, the boy understood this and was seeking to gain the openwhere he would soon get food and directions for continuing hisjourney.They found no other trace of the one they were looking for, however.All that day and the next they drew the net slowly over that portionof the Ozark range that cut through the southwestern part of thestate."I guess we shall have to give it up," confided the leader to Tad."Oh, no, we can't do that," objected the lad hastily.  "We simply mustfind Ned and the Professor.""If you can show me the way how or where, I wish you would then.  Weare only a few miles from the mining camp.  I'll wager a jack rabbitcouldn't have gotten through our lines, so we'd have been prettylikely to have rounded up a man on a pony or a boy on foot.  Don't youthink so?"Tad was forced to admit that this was true."It's my idea that neither of them is in the range now, at all.  Ifthey are, they're below the Red Star--gone by the place entirely.""That may be, but I do not see how it is possible.""You went by her, didn't you?"Tad colored."I guess so.  But it was different in my case.""Ah, that's it.  It's different with them, too.  If it wasn't, wewould have found them long before this.""Then you are going to give it up?  Is that what you mean?""Don't see as there is anything else we can do. If we don't comeacross them this afternoon, we won't at all.  See, there's the RubyMountain already.""The Ruby Mountain!  I've heard of that.  What a peculiar formation itis. Almost blood red in spots.  What is it--isn't there somesuperstition about the rock?""Well, you might call it that. There are those who declare they haveseen strange lights appear on the face of the rock after dark.""Have you?" queried Tad."Well, that's another story," laughed the leader."What makes it look so red?""That's the quality of the rock.  It is red only when the sun orbright moonlight is shining on it.  Isn't really red, you see."Tad did not see, but his mind was too full of his own troubles topermit him to interest it deeply in the subject of the Ruby Mountain.Continuing on their journey, the searchers eventually rode into theRed Star camp.  By this time the entire camp was interested in what itwas pleased to call "the man hunt."  Somehow they were unable to freetheir minds of the idea that the disappearance of the members of thePony Rider party was due to the mysterious band that had beenterrorizing that part of the country for a long time.Tom Phipps, assistant superintendent of the mine, had awaited thereturn of his rescue party with an impatience that he made no effortto conceal.  He met them, mounted on his pony, as they entered themine property.  At first he was inclined to make the men turn aboutand go over the ground again, but after learning from the leader ofthe party the precautions they had taken, he decided that furthersearch to the north would be futile.What to do next he did not know, and in the absence of Mr. Munson, whohad not yet returned, he was considering sending another party out tocover the territory south of the mining camp.Stacy Brown had come in with his guide and the mules, and havingsatisfied his appetite, was in as good humor as usual.  If he worriedabout the disappearance of his companions, he kept his trouble well tohimself.  Nevertheless he was waiting for Tad and the rescue partywhen they rode in."Hello, Chunky, any news?" called Tad on espying him.Stacy shook his head."Have you any?" asked Chunky."No.  We found where Ned had been, but we didn't see anything of him.""That's too bad.""Yes, you do seem to feel sad over it. I believe they are all right,however.  Mr. McCormick, who has charge of this party, thinks so too.He believes they have succeeded in getting out of the mountains.""So do I," cut in Tom Phipps.  "Otherwise you could not have missedthem.""Yes, sir.  But what would you advise doing now?""Should we hear nothing from them by morning I'll start a party forthe open country to the west, and send another through the mountainssouth of here.  I do not believe there will be much use in doing soto-night.  Come over to my shack, you and your friend Brown, and wewill talk the matter over while we are having our supper.""Thank you. I guess I am pretty hungry.  Has Mr. Munson returned?""No.  I cannot imagine what is keeping him."Turning his pony over to Mr. McCormick, Tad and Chunky followed theyoung mining engineer to his one-roomed cabin where the host hadprepared an appetizing meal.It was Tad's second meal in the place.  This time, however, he foundhimself too much disturbed to eat heartily.  His appetite seemed toleave him all at once."As I was saying just after you arrived," began Mr. Phipps--"Hark!  What was that?"Tad raised a hand for silence."I heard nothing.""It was somebody shouting, I am sure," answered Tad in a voice oftense expectancy.  "Yes, there it is again.""You're right," answered the miner, springing up and hurrying to thedoor.The shouting now became general all up and down the street."What is it?" asked Tad."I don't know.  Seems to be a party coming into the camp.  It'sMunson, that's who it is.  There are two people with him on foot.  Ican't make them out in the twilight.  Come on, we'll hurry down andfind out what the uproar is about."Instinctively Tad and Tom Phipps set off at a jog-trot, followed moreleisurely by Stacy Brown.Tad soon observed something familiar in the movements of the twofigures who were walking beside the superintendent's pony, and in amoment Tad made out through the gloom the well-known form of ProfessorZepplin."There they are!  There they are!"  he shouted.  "They've got back.Hurrah!""Rah!" echoed Stacy Brown, flirting one hand lazily.The meeting was a joyous one for all concerned."All hands come over to my shack," glowed Tom Phipps.  "I want to hearabout this mystery.  Thought you were riding a pony, ProfessorZepplin?""He was," laughed Dick Munson. "Some other people wanted the animalmore than he did and helped themselves."At this point, Walter, who was staying in another cabin, having heardthe noise, had hurried over and joined the little party."Now let us hear all about it," urged Phipps, after all had gatheredin his shack."There is not much to tell," smiled the Professor.  "I did exactlywhat I had been warning my young men against.  I lost myself.  Thenthe next thing that happened, I lost my pony.""How?" interrupted Mr. Phipps."I don't know.""Stolen," nodded Dick Munson."Same old game," muttered Phipps.  "Yes, what next?""Then in a most miraculous way I found Master Ned.  I had gone tosleep, worn out and discouraged, not caring much whether I got back ornot, the way I felt then.  Along toward morning I woke up.  I thoughtI had heard something.  I listened, and then all at once realized thatsome one was snoring not far from me.""And it wasn't Chunky this time," cut in Walter Perkins."Chunky doesn't snore on an empty stomach," laughed Tad."I called out, 'Hello, who's there?'  The snorer woke up calling outsomething that I could not catch.""Who was it?" asked Stacy in a hurry to learn what the Professor wasgetting at."Well, when he woke up he said his name was Ned Rector and that he waslost."The Professor smiled grimly as the boys shouted with laughter, inwhich Tom Phipps joined.  Even the rugged face of the superintendentrelaxed into a broad smile."Yes, it was I," nodded Ned.  "We had been sleeping within a rod ofeach other nearly all night and didn't know it.  I had stumbled alongafter the Professor got to sleep.  In the darkness of course I did notsee him, and in his sound sleep he did not hear me.""That's the funniest mix-up I ever heard of," chuckled young Mr.Phipps.  "What did you do for food?""Master Ned, it seems, had shot two rabbits which he intended to takeback to our camp.  When he found that he too was lost, he built a fireand cooked them.  What he did not need at once he wrapped up in hishandkerchief and carried along with him--""Yes, we found the remnants of the jack rabbits," Tad informed them."We picked up your rifle later, as well.""Good," brightened Ned.  "I had to throw it away.  I had about all Icould do to carry myself.""Well, the rabbits saved us from starvation.""Yes, but how did you happen to find Dick Munson, or he to find you?"queried Phipps."We wandered out of the mountains and lost ourselves in the foothills.How we got so far south I do not know.  This morning we saw a horsemanand shouted until we attracted his attention.  The horseman proved tobe the very man we wanted to see--Mr.  Richard Munson himself.""I--I am the only one who didn't fall in," piped Stacy, which causedeveryone to laugh."We heard you shooting," said Walter.  "I wish we might have had someof that rabbit meat.  We nearly starved up there.""Yes, let's hear how you boys got along," spoke up Ned.  "We have toldyou all about our experiences.  Now we want to know about yours."Tad related in detail all that occurred to them since the Professorleft them in pursuit of the elusive camp-fire.  The Professor's eyesglowed appreciatively upon learning of Tad Butler's heroic tramp overnearly forty miles of rough mountain trail in the desperate effort tofind food for his starving companions as well as help to rescue themfrom their perilous position.But Munson, while complimenting Tad, was more deeply interested in theloss of their stock, about which occurrence he asked many questions."If we had a few men with your courage and resourcefulness we shouldsoon put a stop to this wholesale thieving," he said."I'm going to find my pony before I leave this place, Mr. Munson,"announced Tad firmly.  "At least I am going to try pretty hard--"A knock on the door of the shack cut short what he was going to say."McCormick reports that two ponies are missing from number twosection," said a voice outside the door.CHAPTER XVITHE VOICE IN THE ROCK"The thieves are getting bold!" was Dick Munson's comment."Seems to me they not only are getting, but have been for some time,"laughed the Professor.  "The condition of my feet proves that."The Number 2 section to which the superintendent's informant hadreferred, was a quarry mine, off among the mountains in the vicinityof the red rock that had attracted Tad's attention as they neared thecamp.  He made a sudden resolve to visit the place on the followingday.Borrowing a pony next morning, and without telling anyone where he wasgoing, Tad rode away with the Ruby Mountain as his destination.  Thetrail was an easy one to follow and, besides, he had so recently beenover it that he would be able to find his way there and back.Just why he felt such a keen interest in the place the lad did notknow.  Perhaps it was that the miners had thrown such an air ofmystery about it in speaking of the red rock.  Aside from its colorthere was nothing about the pile of stone to distinguish it fromalmost any other rocky formation in the Ozark range, unless it werethe slight resemblance that it bore to the form of a church.  The ladhad observed this the first time he saw it.After riding around the pile, Tad dismounted, and, tethering his pony,proceeded to examine the place more carefully.The rock was rough and uneven, with little spires running up here andthere.  The lowest of these was a considerable distance from theground."I'd like to climb up there if I knew how," decided the boy, lookingfor an advantageous place to make the attempt."I have it.  I know what I'll do.  I'll rope the rock."Tad laughed gayly at the thought as he ran back to where he hadtethered the pony in the shrubbery.  Tom Phipps had seen to it thatthe outfit was fully equipped, having added a lariat, because Tad hadjokingly inquired where this necessary equipment was."Glad I happened to think of that.  I'll never ride out without a ropeagain, even if it's up and down Main Street in Chillicothe."Fetching the rawhide rope he skilfully cast it up and over thepinnacle of rock nearest to him.  It was now a comparatively easymatter to climb by going hand over hand up the rope and bracing hisfeet against the side of the rock at the same time.Once having reached the point where the rope had been fastened, therest of the way was less rough.The lad sat down to look about him, noting that the formation was apeculiar one, and that the reddish shade of the rock disappeared whenone came into close contact with it."Why, it's just a plain, ordinary pile of stone," laughed Tad.  "Theidea that there could be anything mysterious about it!  I'll climb upto the top and see if there is anything more interesting there."There were frequent narrow crevices that the young explorer discoveredon the way up.  These appeared to reach down to a considerable depth,but having no weight to attach to the end of his rope he could notsound the depth with any degree of certainty.  One of these creviceswas large enough to admit his body.The place fascinated him."I'm coming out here prepared to go down in that hole and investigateit," he said to himself.  "I'll bring the boys--no, I won't either.I'll explore it all myself and maybe I'll find out something."The lad was coiling his rope, preparing to descend when a low chucklecaused him to pause in sudden surprise.  Startled, the boy lookedabout him.  He was alone as he had been before."That's strange.  I was sure I heard some one.  Sounded as if it wereright here beside me.  I must have been wrong of course.  Believe I'mlosing my grit.  After all the shaking up my nerves have had on thistrip--""Hello!"This time there could be no doubt.  It was a human voice beyond allquestion."Hello," answered Tad, when, an instant later, he had in a measuremastered his surprise.  "Where are you?""Guess.""I can't.  I am not a good hand at guessing."Getting to his feet the lad began searching about, peering intocrevices, looking over the edge of the cliff, becoming more and moreperplexed and mystified as the moments passed."No, I can't find you.  Come out and show yourself, whoever you are,"he commanded, with some impatience.A low, mocking laugh answered Tad's irritated command, yet the ownerof the voice still remained hidden."Who are you, anyway?  I know you are a girl, but--""But what?" tantalized the voice."That's all I know about it, and all I shall at the present rate.Come on, it's not fair to expect me to talk with you when I can't seeyou--""Aren't you afraid of ghosts, boy--""Ghosts!"Tad uttered the word in a startled voice."Wha--what ghosts?""Yes.""No, I'm not," he answered sharply.  "But if it were night I think I'drun.  Pshaw! you're no more ghost than I am.  You're just a girl and Iam going to find out where you are right now."Acting upon his resolution, Tad began searching for the owner of thevoice again.  But when he had crawled to one side of the rock, thevoice appeared to be on the other, where he had just been.After a time Tad gave it up.  He no longer heard the mysterious voice,so he clambered down, and after examining the rock from the groundonce more, mounted his pony for return to camp.Arriving there, his companions wanted to know where he had been, butTad managed to evade their question without giving them a directanswer.He was determined to return on the following day, when he would goabout finding the owner of the mysterious voice in a different way.When Tom Phipps came in from work, Tad drew him aside at the firstopportunity."I've been over to the Ruby Mountain to-day, but please don't tellanyone.""Saw something, did you?" laughed the assistant superintendent."No, that's the trouble.  I didn't.""What happened then?""I did not see, but I heard."  Tad then related all that had occurredon his visit to the strange mountain.Phipps did not laugh.  He remained silent and thoughtful for somemoments."That's strange.  A miner prospecting there came back with a similarstory a few months ago.  Nobody believed him, though many strangethings are said to have happened in the vicinity of that rock.""What?""That's the trouble.  One cannot get them to tell what they saw.  Youhave come the nearest to doing so.""Only I just missed it by about a mile," laughed Tad.  "But you do notthink it's--how shall I say it?"Phipps bent a keen glance on the young man.  "You mean through anysupernatural agency?"Tad nodded."That's what I wanted to say, but didn't know just how to put it.""No, I am too practical to believe any such trash as that.  My idea isthat some one of a humorous turn of mind is trying to play tricks onpeople.  You say it was a girl's voice?""Yes.""That's strange.  I'm going to look into that.""Let's you and I go over there together to to-morrow, then," urged Tadenthusiastically."I'll do it--that is, if there is nothing on hand to detain me.  I'lllet you know later whether it will be possible or not.""Very well.  I have been thinking--wondering whether--"Tad hesitated."Wondering what?""Whether that rock has anything to do with so many horses and thingsbeing stolen in the range."Tom Phipps laughed heartily."I never thought of it in that light.  Don't see how a rock couldpossibly have any connection with it.  Guess we shall have to look forsomething more human than a pile of stone."It was decided, therefore, that on the morrow the two should visit theRuby Mountain, when they would make a careful examination of the placein an effort to solve the mystery.But they were destined to delay this trip for some time, and to passthrough some exciting experiences before they solved the mystery ofthe Ruby Mountain.CHAPTER XVIIWHEN THE DARK HORSE WON"Professor, Mr. Munson says there's going to be a roping contest andhorse race near here, this afternoon.  May we go over to see it?"asked Ned Rector early on the following morning."Well, I don't know about that.  Haven't you boys had enough strayingfrom home for a time?""We can get some one to go with us and show us the way," urged Walter."Yes, let the lads go," said Mr. Munson, coming up at that moment."Where is this place?" asked the Professor."At Jessup's ranch.  It is about ten miles to the southeast of here,just outside the foothills of the range.""I am afraid they would never find the way there and back," objectedProfessor Zepplin, shaking his head doubtfully."That is easily taken care of.  I will have some one go with them.Why not go yourself?""I?  No, thank you, not without a guide.  I have had quite enoughexperience in trying to find my way about in these mountains," laughedthe Professor."Then I'll have Tom Phipps go with you.  I understand the boys arefond of anything in the horse line, and they usually have a great timeover at Jessup's.  He is a cattle man and, besides his own men,cowboys from neighboring ranches for twenty miles around ride in totake part.""But, we have no ponies.""I think we can arrange that all right.  Here, Tom, I want you."Mr. Phipps approached the little group, the superintendent, informinghim in a few words of the plan he had in mind."Of course I'll go with them," smiled Phipps.  "I'll be glad of thechance to get out in the open once more.  We had better get startedpretty soon if we are going.""How about it, Professor?" queried Mr. Munson."I do not object if Mr. Phipps accompanies them.""Hooray!" shouted the boys."Wish we had our own ponies," added Ned."So do I," chorused the others."You will come along, won't you, Professor?" urged Walter."No, I think not.  I've had quite enough for a time.  Think I willremain and study the geological formations of the strata hereabouts.""There's plenty of it to occupy you for some time," laughed Tom.  "Themost important zinc mines in the world are strung along this range.And besides, there's lead enough hereabouts to supply the armies ofthe world if they were all engaged in active warfare."Arrangements were quickly made for the trip to Jessup's, and the boys,full of anticipations for a pleasant day in the saddle, donned theirchaps and spurs, and began practising with their ropes, while theponies were being saddled and made ready for the journey."Do we take our rifles, Professor?" asked Stacy."You do not," answered the Professor, with emphasis.  "What do youthink you will need with guns at a horse race?""I--I don't know but that we might meet some wild animals," stammeredStacy.Everybody laughed."Why, there are no wild animals of any account here," laughed Tom."Nothing bigger than a jack rabbit," said Ned."And Ned Rector got all there was of them," added Walter.Laughing and joking, the lads mounted their ponies and set off for aday's pleasure.The entertainment at the ranch was scheduled for the afternoon, sothey had plenty of time in which to make the journey.  They arrivedshortly before noon, just in time to see the preparations made for abarbecue.  A large Texas steer had been chosen for the occasion androasted in a pit, and they were making ready to serve it.Stacy's eyes stuck out as he saw the cook with a knife almost as longas a sword, cutting off slices as large as a good-sized platter, andserving them on plates scarcely large enough to hold the pieces,without the latter being folded over.The fat boy managed to get an early helping by pushing his way throughthe crowd of hungry men that had gathered about the savory roast.When there was anything to eat, Stacy Brown would always be found inthe front rank.Just as they got started with the meal, a volley of shots sounded upthe valley and a band of half a dozen cowboys, yelling, whooping andshouting came racing down on the Jessup ranch.With a wild "y-e-o-w!" they circled the roast ox, then bringing theirponies up sharply, threw themselves from their saddles and greedilyattacked the portions that were quickly handed out to them.This barbecue and day of sports was one looked forward to by thecowmen with keen anticipation.  Two a year were given on the Jessupranch, one after the midsummer round up, and another late in the fall."This is great," confided Tad to Tom Phipps, as the two seatedthemselves on the grass to eat the good things set before them."It seems so to me.  I don't get out of the mountains very often.  Iwish I could ride the way you boys do.  You ride very well.""We have to.  At first some of us came a few croppers," laughed Ned,who had overheard the conversation.  "Chunky had the most trouble, hislegs being so short that it's difficult for him to reach thestirrups.""I fell off," interjected the fat boy."That's a habit of his," laughed Ned."I wonder if they would let us take part in some of the games thisafternoon," inquired Tad."Why, of course they will.  I'll speak to Mr. Jessup about it,"answered Tom Phipps.When the owner of the ranch passed them later on, Tom called him, andafter introducing the boys to him, told the rancher what they desiredto do.Mr. Jessup looked the lads over critically."It's a pretty rough game, boys," he smiled.  "But you look as if youwere able to take care of yourselves.  Of course you may go in for thefun if you want to.  I'll tell the bunch.""Thank you," said Tad, rising.Mr. Jessup shouted to attract the attention of the noisy cowboys."Hey, fellows, we have a bunch of tenderfeet lads from the East withus to-day.  They're taking a trip over the mountains and they want toknow if they can join you in the fun this afternoon?""Sure!" roared the cowboys. "We'll give the tenderfeet all the funthey want."Tad smiled appreciatively."Don't let them disturb you," warned Tom.  "They mean all right.""Yes, sir; I understand cowmen pretty well.  Have spent quite a littletime with them.""I guess they are getting ready for something.""Line up for the hurdle race!" shouted the ranch foreman, who wasacting as master of ceremonies.  "Half mile down and back with ahurdle every quarter!""Here's where you see some real fun," announced Mr. Jessup, noddingsignificantly to Tad and Tom Phipps.  "Are you boys going into this?""Guess we might as well.  Will these ponies take hurdles, Mr.Phipps?""You try them and see.  Every one trained down to the ground.""That's not the way I want to go," laughed Tad.  "I want to stay aboveit while I'm riding."Ned Rector already was tightening his saddle girths preparatory toentering, so Tad hurried to his own mount to get ready for thecontest.When the contestants had finally lined up, the Pony Rider Boys weresurprised to observe that Stacy Brown had ridden down to the scratchwith the others.  He was sitting on his pony as solemn as an owl,industriously munching a sandwich that he had made for himself."You'll break your neck.  You'd better keep out of this," advised NedRector."Better look out for your own neck," retorted Stacy.  "Guess I knowhow to ride as well as the rest of you.""All right, it's not my lookout.  Remember I gave you good advice,"was Ned's parting admonition.Stacy's pony was a glossy black, the only one of that color among thecontestants, and between pony and boy the cowmen were undecided as towhich was the most conspicuous."At the second shot of the pistol you will start," announced theforeman.  "All ready for the first?""Yes!" roared the impatient riders.The foreman pulled the trigger and the ponies began to dance about.Bang!"Whoop-e-e-e!" yelled the riders, digging in the rowels of theirspurs.A dozen ponies fairly leaped into the air under the prod of spur andquirt.  Away they dashed enveloped in a cloud of dust."They're off!" roared the crowd.Stacy, still clinging to his sandwich, was well up with the leaders ofthe bunch when they got away.  He was riding with elbows up to a levelwith his shoulders, one hand grasping reins and quirt, the otherholding the sandwich to his mouth.The spectators shouted with laughter at the sight."There goes somebody!" cried Walter.One of the ponies had fouled the first hurdle and gone down, plowingthe dust with its nose, while the cowboy made a fairly graceful divethrough the air, landing on his head and shoulders.  The ridersdirectly behind him were obliged to hurdle pony and rider, which theydid without mishap to either.  Stacy, fortunately was ahead, else hetoo might have come a cropper.This left a field of eleven, all of whom were bunched, their mountsalmost rubbing sides.  By this time the dust cloud was so dense thatthe spectators were able to make nothing at all of what was going onat the other end of the course."I hope the youngsters are all right," said Phipps a little anxiously,for the race was one of the roughest he had ever seen, and then theyoung miner was not much of a horseman, which made the contest seemmuch more hazardous to him than it really was."They're coming back," shouted a voice.The turn had been made, but at the expense of two riders, whosemounts, less sure footed than the rest, had gone down in the sharpwhirl for the home stretch.The prize in this contest was to be a handsome telescope repeatingrifle, and the rivalry for it was keen.  The battle would be a sternone, and it was a foregone conclusion that the best horse would win.Stacy Brown had not leaned far enough in at the turn, his saddle girthslipping a little as a result.  He felt the saddle give a littlebeneath him, but did not realize what had happened until the pony hadstraightened away on the home stretch.  The saddle then slipped stillfurther under the weight of the rider.Stacy threw almost the whole force of his weight on the right stirrupto offset the list of the saddle on the other side, where the stirruphad gone down too far for him to reach.  And the first hurdle foundthe lad clinging desperately to the pony's mane with one hand, thejolt of the jump nearly dislocating his neck as the animal took it.The youthful rider, finding himself safely over, uttered a series ofshrill yells and began urging on the pony with quick, shortencouraging blows of the quirt, though the blows were not heavy enoughto hurt the tough little beast at all.  It was used to much moreserious treatment.Somehow the animal seemed bent on doing its best, though the more itstrove to reach the goal, the greater was the fat boy's torture.Stacy Brown's grit was aroused.  He seemed to have come into his ownat last."They laughed at me," he muttered.  "I'll show them that Chunky Brownisn't a tenderfoot.  Even if I don't win the race, there will be someothers who will finish after I get through."  He was reasonablycertain of this from his present position.  "But I hope I don't fallin," he grinned.By this time the dust caused by their first trip over the course, hadsettled so that the spectators were enabled to get a view of the lastquarter of the race. And they all admitted, without exception, that itwas a real race that they were watching.Over the last hurdle went two ponies in beautiful curving leaps, aheadof all the others.  With their cowboy riders they took the obstructionneck and neck.  A full length behind them rode Stacy with the rest ofthe field strung out to his rear.The spectators were able to identify the black now from their point ofvantage, and Stacy could hear their cheers, though unaware that thesewere for him.  Tad Butler, second to him in the race, was gettingevery ounce of speed from his pony that the animal possessed.  Yetinstead of feeling chagrin over the fact that his companion wasout-footing him, Tad was elated."Go it, Chunky!  Go it!" he encouraged."I am going," floated back to Tad faintly, causing him to laugh soheartily that he was nearly unhorsed when his pony rose to the hurdle.As Stacy's mount cleared the last barrier, the fat boy fell forward onthe pony's neck, which he grasped wildly, for the saddle in that finalleap had, with disheartening suddeness, given way beneath him,slipping clear down under the animal's stomach.Nothing daunted, Stacy, with his newly discovered grit, worked bothspurs vigorously, eyes staring straight ahead of him over the head ofhis fleeing pony.They were almost at the finish.  Now the dust of the two cowboyleaders in the race did not smite him in the face as heretofore.  Hewas too close up with them for that.All at once the lad realized that he was gaining.  Excitement amongthe spectators ran high.  Observing his predicament and understandingfull well the grit he was exhibiting, they were yelling like mad.Chunky began to yell also, uttering a series of shrill whoops, usingvoice and spurs incessantly, urging the pony to the goal.The black pony, almost gray with the dust that had settled on hissleek, glossy coat, forged ahead in a noble sprint with head on alevel with its back, nose reaching for the finish.A roar of applause sounded in the fat boy's ears.  Yells, cat callsand shrill whoops rent the air.All at once a pistol barked, the black pony's feet plowed the dust,bringing it to a sharp halt.The suddenness of the movement caused Chunky's feet to rise straightup into the air. For a few brief seconds he was standing on his headon the pony's neck like a circus performer.Then, as the animal lowered its head, the rider toppled over, stillclinging to the neck of his mount.  Such a chorus of laughter andshouting the Jessup ranch had never known before."How is it, Mr. Umpire?" piped Stacy, releasing one hand from thepony's neck and raising it questioningly."This isn't a baseball game, young fellow," jeered the foreman.  "Thisis a hoss race and you've won it.  The black wins and you get therifle."The grimy hand that the lad had held aloft still clung to the remnantsof the roast sandwich that he had carried throughout race.CHAPTER XVIIITAD WINS A ROPING CONTESTIn their enthusiasm two of the ranchers hoisted Chunky to theirshoulders and marched about singing.  Others fell in behind them untilfully half the spectators had joined the procession.  Chunky leereddown at his companions as he passed them and winked solemnly."I didn't suppose he could ride like that," marveled Tom Phipps."Neither did any of the rest of us," answered Walter."I never saw a more plucky piece of work in my life."Tad came up to where they were, laughing heartily."Doesn't that beat all, Walt?""It certainly does.""Our friends who were defeated do not seem to appreciate the humor ofit, though," interjected the young engineer."No, not very sportsmanlike, is it?  Who is that fellow with whomChunky's competitors are talking?""Name is Cravath.  Queer sort of a chap.""Haven't I seen him about the Red Star?" asked Tad."Yes, no doubt.  He is a checker at the mine.  He and his wife anddaughter have a cabin out near the Ruby Rock that you are so muchinterested in.  I know very little about him--""Don't like his looks at all," decided Tad."No, I never warmed up to him very much myself.  I understand he isnot very popular among the men, either.  But I guess that is becausehe wins their money in games of chance.""A gambler?" questioned both boys in surprise."I wouldn't go far enough to say that. What are they going to do nexthere do you know?" asked the engineer, changing the subject."I believe it is to be a roping contest.  That will be a lot of fun.""You are not going in it, are you?""Of course.  Why not?  I don't know what they are going to rope, butI'll take my chance with the rest of them whatever it is.  Guess I'llride over and ask Mr. Jessup. I see him over there now."Mr. Jessup when questioned informed the boy that it was to be a mostrealistic contest in which two men mounted were to try to rope eachother.  One of the rules of the contest was that the roper, when hecaught his opponent, was to drop the lariat instantly so as not topull his victim from the saddle.As only two could meet for the prize it was decided that lots shouldbe drawn from a hat.  The two who drew slips of paper with the word"rope" written on them, were to have the honor of meeting in a test ofskill.The prize was a Mexican saddle, silver mounted, at which all thecowmen looked with covetous eyes."Think you want to take a chance for the saddle, boy?" asked Mr.Jessup."That I do," laughed Tad.  "That's the saddle I want--I always havewanted one just like it.  But I'm afraid I shall not get theopportunity to try for it.""They are getting ready to draw.  You had better go over," advised therancher.Tad found that they were not only getting ready, but that most of themen had already drawn.  Only one "rope" slip had been taken from thehat, however, so there still was a chance.He rode up to the foreman, who was holding the hat from which thedrawing was being done."May I draw?" he asked."Do you know how to sling a rope, kid?""A little," answered Tad, with an embarrassed smile, for the cowmenwere making uncomplimentary remarks about letting babies into a man'sgame.  The boy's face burned, but he gave no heed to theirungentlemanly remarks.The foreman held up the hat.  Tad leaned over and drew from it a slipof paper."Next--who draws next?" demanded the foreman."If it will save you any trouble, I might suggest that it isn'tnecessary to draw further," Tad informed him, with the suspicion of asmile on his face."What's that?" asked the foreman sharply."I have the second slip," was the quiet reply.The cowboys broke into loud exclamations of disapproval."Fair is fair, boys," warned Mr. Jessup.  "You all had your chance andyou lost.""Yes, that's right," agreed the foreman.  "You fellows will have toswallow your pills without making faces."The man Cravath was now talking with the cowboy who had drawn theother slip.  He was one of the men Chunky had won from, though Tad didnot know it at the moment.Tom Phipps pushing his way up to the lad informed him of this fact,and drawing Tad to one side whispered something to him."Is that so?""Yes, Cravath owns one of the ponies that came near winning the race.He is not a very good-natured man and I imagine they are putting upsome plan to get even with you boys," warned Tom."I'm not afraid.  They won't let them do anything unfair," said Tad."Besides, I ought to be able to take care of myself, by this time,though I haven't been doing much with the rope of late.  Is that chapan expert roper?""I couldn't say as to that.  But he's big and strong--""Which doesn't count for very much in this sort of a contest," laughedthe boy."Very well, you know best.  But keep your eyes on him.""Are you gentlemen ready to begin?" called the rancher."I must go now," said Tad hurriedly."Good-bye and good luck," breathed Mr. Phipps, as the lad rode away atthe same time straightening out his rope which he allowed to dragbehind his pony while he recoiled it, working it in his hands tolimber the rawhide."It's a good rope," decided Tad.The foreman halted them for final instructions."Now, gentlemen, understand that the rope must go over the head and bedrawn taut, after which you are to let go of it.  You are to take yourplaces some distance apart--I'll place you--and start at the crack ofthe pistol, not before.  Understand?"Tad and the cowman opposed to him nodded, the latter with a sarcasticgrin on his face.The miner had lost the rifle which he coveted, and the cowboy did notpropose to have the same luck in the case of the saddle, which wasvery valuable.The cowboy had his rope in hand ready to begin, while Tad's had beenhung over the saddle horn.  The lad was sitting in his saddle easily,with a quiet smile on his face, and the spectators noted that he wasnot in the least nervous."I guess that boy knows his business," muttered Mr. Jessup, who hadbeen observing him keenly.  "At least he's got the pluck and will givea good account of himself, though he never will be able to win againsta professional rope thrower."In the meanwhile, the foreman had started to place thecontestants. Tad had the sun in his eyes, but he made no protest,knowing that he could change his position as soon as they got the wordto go."Are you ready?""All ready," answered Tad cheerfully."Yes," said the cowboy shortly.Tad's rope was now held in his right hand.  Both men put spurs totheir mounts almost before the report of the revolver had died way.The ponies leaped forward and the two opponents rode straight at eachother.They passed at racing speed, neither making an attempt to cast.No sooner had they cleared each other, however, than the cowboy pulledup his horse sharply, wheeled and dashed after the Pony Rider Boy.Tad, having foreseen the movement, had likewise stopped his mount, andturned about.  But instead of spurring on, he stood still.The cowboy had hoped to come up behind Tad and rope him as he racedaway.  He was slightly disconcerted when he noted Tad's position.  Butthe smiling face of the boy angered him, and the cowman's ropesquirmed through the air.Tad ducked, allowing the lariat to shoot on over him.  It fellharmlessly on the other side of his pony and a quick pressure of thespurs took boy and pony from under it.With a "yip-yip" Tad rushed at his opponent.  The latter had had notime to gather in his own lariat, but he began shortening it upintending to swing it from where it lay on the ground.His opponent gave him no time for this.Tad made a quick cast.  The cowboy threw himself to one side, but theloop of the lariat that had been thrown true reached his broadsombrero, neatly snipping it from his head.The spectators uttered a yell of approval.  They shook out theirrevolvers, sending a rattling volley up into the air.Tad Butler had scored first.His opponent was angered almost beyond control.  That a mere boy couldthus outwit him, which Tad had neatly done, was too much for his fierytemper.With a growl of rage he drove his horse straight at the lad.  It wasplain that it was the fellow's intention to ride him down, which Tadcircumvented by standing still until the man was nearly upon him, andthen driving his pony out of the path of the oncoming horseman.Each began a series of manoeuvres, the purpose of which was to placethe rider behind his opponent, but each proved too wary to be caughtin any such way.The contest was growing hotter every moment, and the spectators weregetting worked up to a high pitch of excitement.  They had never seena more interesting roping exhibition than this, and that a boy was oneof the contestants gave their enthusiasm an added zest.The two were, by this time, working far out on the field.  Tadrealized this and sought to get back nearer to their starting point.He did not, however, understand that his adversary had any object ingetting so far away, though the man had a distinct purpose in sodoing, as Tad eventually learned.The foreman was shouting a warning to them, which Tad tried to heed,although his adversary prevented his doing so by blocking the way eachtime.Whenever the opportunity presented itself the cowboy would bump hispony violently against the one that Tad Butler was riding, in aneffort either to so jar the boy that he could rope him or elsepossibly to unhorse the lad."See here, you stop that!" shouted Tad after the third attempt.  "Whatare you trying to do to me?""I'll show you, you freckle-faced tenderfoot!" yelled the cowboy,making a vicious rush.  At the same time his rawhide shot out.Tad narrowly missed being caught that time, and in turn the cowboy wasnearly caught by Tad's loop.  A lucky sweep of his arm brushed I thelariat away not a second too soon.Tad observing that his adversary, who was about to cast again, had himat a dangerous advantage, threw himself down on the side of the pony'sneck.  Both animals were running almost neck and neck at the moment.With a whoop the cowboy let go.  His loop closed around the boy'sankle which from his position on the pony's side, was sticking well upin the air.  Tad's opponent, suddenly braced his pony, while the boy'smount raced straight ahead.The result of this move was that Tad Butler was torn from his saddle,fetching away the stirrup box on one side with him.  He struck theground violently, and for a moment lay still, while the cowboy satgrinning, making no effort to learn how badly his adversary was hurt.The foreman and several others were rushing to the scene.  By the timethey reached it, Tad was scrambling to his feet."I roped the kid," announced the cowboy, as if it were all finallysettled."You roped me by the foot," retorted Tad."Yes, that was a foul," said the foreman.  "I saw it myself.  How'dyou come to do that, Bob?""Mistake," answered the cowboy, thus admitting that they were right.Tad turned on him sharply."Did you say it was a mistake?" he asked with a world of meaning inhis tone."We will award the prize to you, Butler," announced the owner of theranch.  "That's the usual way when a foul has been committed."The cowboy glowered angrily."I couldn't think of accepting it, Mr. Jessup," answered Tad,straightening to his full height.  "I'll go on with the contest, buthe mustn't do that to me again or there will be trouble."Some of them laughed at the boy's veiled threat."There certainly will be trouble," agreed Mr. Jessup--"trouble withme.  I want you two to keep up the field further so we can see what isgoing on.  Are you hurt, boy?""Shaken up a little that's all.  Guess my saddle was worse used than Iwas."The contestants lined up for another bout, amid the most intenseexcitement.  So closely had the spectators gathered about them thatthe ropers had no room in which to work, and the foreman found itnecessary to urge them back before giving the word to start.The Pony Rider Boys could scarcely contain themselves.  They, too,were worked up to a high pitch of excitement.  But Tad Butler, dirty,with clothes torn and grimy, appeared to be the coolest one in thecrowd.  If he was angry no one would have imagined it from thepleasant expression of his face and almost laughing eyes."All ready!  Go!"They went at each other again, the cowboy ferociously--Tad easily, butkeenly on the alert, narrowly watching every move of his opponent.Round and round circled the pair, neither making an effort to cast forat least ten minutes, ducking, side stepping, or as near to thislatter as a pony could get, and with movements much like those ofboxers in a ring.The crowd was offering advice and suggestions freely, but both menturned a deaf ear to all of this.  Their whole beings were centered onthe work in hand.Once both men cast and their lariats locked, the cowboy's loop havingslipped over Tad's.The foreman called a halt while he untied the tangle.  The instantthis had been accomplished, Tad drew in his with one hand, coiling itat the pony's side."Remember, I haven't called time," warned the foreman.  "You are stillroping."Tad knew that, but he did not wish to take an unfair advantage.The cowboy looked up with a startled expression on his face, butnodded and began hauling in his rope when he noted that Tad was makingno move.His rope was in."All ready," he said.So was Tad.  The boy's lariat shot gracefully through the air, landingneatly over the cowman's shoulders where it was quickly jerked tautbefore the other fully realized what had happened.CHAPTER XIXWRECKED IN AN ORE CARIt was all the ranch owner could do to keep peace after Tad Butler hadso cleverly outwitted his adversary in the rope throwing contest.Yet, though the defeated man was fairly beside himself with rage, thecowboys generally favored fair play.Their companion had been beaten in a fair contest, principally becausehis opponent had been quicker witted.Tad and Chunky, one bearing a rifle, the other a handsome saddle, wereproud boys when they rode home with Tom Phipps and their companionsthat night.  The Pony Rider Boys had carried away the real prizes ofthe cowboy meet.  Chunky had few words.  He was so filled withself-importance that he could only look his gratification.  When partway home, however, he rode up beside Tad, and leaning from his saddle,whispered, "I didn't fall off, did I?"The news of triumph spread about the mining camp quickly.  When theminers learned that Cravath's pony and his man had been defeated, theyshouted for joy.  From that moment the Pony Rider Boys became personsof consequence in the Red Star mining camp.It was suggested that evening that the whole party spend the next dayin the mine.  Tom Phipps had permission to devote the day to them ifthey wished to go underground."That will be fine," cried Tad, to which sentiment all the restsubscribed, except Stacy."I'm going hunting," he announced."Hunting?  What for?" questioned Ned."Anything I can see.""Then, I'm glad we are all going to spend the day underground.  Itwill be about the only safe place around this part of the country.""Remember, Chunky, that's a powerful weapon of yours and long range,"warned Tad."And remember to watch out that you don't fall off your new saddle andbreak your neck," retorted the fat boy.On the following morning the boys, with the exception of Stacy,reported at Tom Phipps's shack ready for the day's sight-seeing in thezinc mine far underground.  The assistant superintendent had madeready a large basket of food, as the party was to dine in the mine.Professor Zepplin was enthusiastic.  It was an opportunity that he hadmuch desired."I understand," he said, fixing Tom Phipps with a stern glance ofinquiry, as they started for the mine, "that Silurian species havebeen found in the limestones hereabouts.  Also that others believed tobe Cambrian have been discovered.  Is this in accordance with yourexperience?""I think I understand to what you refer," answered Tom gravely.  "Ican't say that I am familiar with the species, however.""If Chunky was here he would want to know if it were something toeat," laughed Ned.  "I'm not very certain myself whether it is ornot.""You'll be wiser by-and-by," said Tad.Entrance to the mine was gained through a shaft leading straight downfor a great many feet.  A windlass and bucket was employed to carrythe miners up and down, while through another and larger shaftautomatic buckets raised the zinc ore to the surface.All of the party could not be accommodated in the passenger bucket atone time, so it was necessary to make two trips, Mr. Phipps returningwith the vehicle to see that the rest of the boys got down safely.Descending into the cool, damp darkness was a new experience for them.And while the sensations were not particularly pleasant, they agreedthat it was the most interesting journey they ever had taken."How far down do we go?" asked Walter."About fifty feet," answered the miner.  "Of course the mine is notthat far underground all around.  Some of the strata of rock we worklead almost to the surface in places.""Why don't you begin at the top and work down then?" questioned Tad."Some of the mines do that.  In this case it was deemed best to sink ashaft.  Here we are."From the darkness the boys had suddenly been plunged into a blindingglare of light.  It was so intense that at first they were unable tosee anything."Good gracious," blinked Ned.  "This is brighter than the opera houseat Chillicothe.  It's enough to put a fellow's eyes out.  What is it?""Electric lights," laughed Phipps.  "We don't have many conveniencesabove ground, but down here we are right up-to-date, as you haveobserved.""As I perhaps shall observe when I am able to get my eyes open oncemore," added Ned humorously."Why, the place is full of tunnels!" exclaimed Walter."Regular checker-board under ground," agreed Tad.  "Where do all thosetunnels go to?""Under where you have been tramping since you have been in camp.""To the Ruby Mountain?" inquired Tad meaningly."Yes, most probably that far, or pretty close to it, I should say; butI have never made a measurement with that in view, so that I am unableto give you a definite answer.  We should have to bore through somepretty solid rock to get under the little red mountain, I'm inclinedto think.""I'd like to go over that way.""All right, we will visit that part of the drift later," repliedMr. Phipps.What Tad's motive might have been in wishing to get under the RubyMountain, perhaps he himself did not know.  But he did know thatsomehow he felt that before leaving the mining camp he would solve themystery of the place.They first followed the drifts to the west where here and there a dulldistant report told them the miners were blasting out the rocks withdynamite.  After being broken up into large chunks the ore was placedon little cars and run along tracks to the hoisting apparatus fromwhere it was quickly shot to the surface.It was a busy scene that the Pony Rider Boys found--a different worldfrom the one they had just left above them."Do these mines ever blow up or catch fire?" asked Walter a bitapprehensively."No, we have no fires of any consequence.  We have never had anexplosion and I trust we never shall," answered the assistantsuperintendent gravely.  "You see there is not the same danger in thissort of place that you find in a coal mine.  I would prefer to workdigging out dynamite to mining coal.""Dynamite?  Do you keep much of it down here?" interrupted theProfessor."Oh, yes, we have to.  There is enough down here at this moment tomore than blow up the Ruby Mountain.  The greater part of it is storedin what is known as the Ozark drift, the drift running to thesoutheast.  I'll show it to you when we go that way."Now they were nearing the more active operations and the metallicclick of the steam drills filled the air as they bored their waythrough the solid rock, necessitating the raising of voices that theboys might make themselves heard."Would you like to take a ride in one little cars?" asked Mr. Phipps.The boys were quite certain that they would enjoy such a trip."Pile into the next car, then.  We'll send it through without any orethis time.  There would not be room if we were to load the car.  Ithink it will be a novel experience for you."And Tom Phipps smiled significantly.Directing the switch man to shift the car back to the return track,the mining engineer told the lads to climb in and sit down on thefloor, which they did promptly.Only the tops of their heads projected above the sides of the ore car."Under no circumstances must any of you straighten up unless you wishto get your heads smashed.""Why, there is plenty of room for our heads here," replied Ned.  "Wecould stand up and yet have some to spare.""Right here, yes.  We shall go through some places that you would notwant to stand through, I imagine.""Are you ready?""Yes."Tom Phipps climbed over into the car."All right, Jim," he called.Immediately the car began to move and in a few moments had attained ahigh rate of speed."Now, boys, remember your heads," cautioned their guide.Instinctively each crouched lower as their vehicle was all at onceplunged into sudden darkness.  Drops of water now and then spattereddown on their bare heads.  The noise of the car in the dark wasdeafening.  The sound was as if many ore cars instead of one werecrashing through the dark tunnel.  The lads experienced a strangethrill when the realization came to them with its full force, thatthey were shooting through the earth, far beneath the surface at thespeed of an express train."Why don't you have lights in here?" asked one of the passengers."Not necessary," said Mr. Phipps.  "It is seldom that anyone hasoccasion to go through this tunnel--practically never unless somethinghappens to a car in here.  There are lights along that may be turnedon if necessary, but it would be a needless expense to keep them goingall the time--""What's that loud noise?" asked Tad.His ears had caught a booming roar that was a new note in theterrifying sounds of the underworld through which they were traveling.The boys started uneasily."It's water," shouted the guide.  "A cataract in an underground watercourse.  These courses have cut channels all through the limestonerocks in the Ozark Uplift."This somewhat calmed the nerves of the lads, though not wholly so.Faster and faster rolled the car and louder and louder grew the roarof the cataract."Are we almost out of here?" demanded Walter uneasily."Yes.  We shall be clear of it in five or six minutes now.  You noticethat we strike little grades occasionally, which cause the car to slowdown considerably and for that reason the journey seems longer than itreally is.""If we have slowed down at any time I have failed to observe it,"laughed Tad."What if we should jump the track in here?" suddenly suggested Ned."But we won't," answered the guide. "We--"A grinding, crunching sound cut short his words.  The car appeared topause and tremble throughout the length of its frame; then followed adeafening crash, accompanied by the sound of breaking timbers andsplintering wood.A deep silence, broken only by the roar of the cataract, settled overthe scene.  The ore car lay a broken, twisted, hopeless wreck.CHAPTER XXA MESSAGE THAT THRILLEDOut of the silence came the voice of Ned Rector."Help, I'm pinned down," he groaned.  "Get me out of this awful hole.""I'm coming as soon as I can get free of what's on top of me,"answered Tad.  "Is everybody else all right?  W-a-l-t!  Mr.Phi-ipp-s!"Tad struggled desperately and in a brief time succeeded in freeinghimself.  What had happened to the guide and to Walter he did not dareto think.First upon getting clear of the obstruction that pinned him down, herushed to Ned Rector and succeeded in releasing him without greatdifficulty.  Neither boy was hurt much."Where's the other two?" cried Tad in a voice of anxiety."I don't know.  Don't know where I am myself," groaned Ned."Hurry, help me find them."Together the boys groped about in the black tunnel."I've got one," called Ned."Which one?""I don't know.  Yes, yes, it's Walt.  He's breathing.  What shall Ido?""Drag him over to one side.  I've got Mr. Phipps here.  I'll have himover there in a minute."Tad began tugging, with hands under the shoulders of the guide,understanding instinctively that he must get him where they could workover him and try to bring him back to consciousness.Something whizzed by in the darkness, the rush of air nearly knockingboth boys over, and leaving them trying to catch their breaths."Wh--what's that?" gasped Ned."I--I don't know," answered Tad.  "Yes, I do too.  It--it was a carreturning on the other track for a load of ore."The lad's knees went weak under him when it came to him that he hadonly a second before dragged the unconscious figure of the youngengineer from that very track.Now still another sound startled them.  It was a roar heavier than anythat they had heard before, and as near as they could tell, it wasfrom the direction that they had come."Hurry, Ned!" shouted Tad Butler fairly electrified by the thoughtthat suddenly flashed over him."What is it?  What is it?""I--I don't know, but I think it's a car of ore rushing down the gradetoward us.""We're dead ones, then!" cried Ned."Be quick, Ned!  Grab Walt and run as you never ran before!"On, on! Keep to your right so you don't get on the return track.  Oh,Hurry!"Tad had already gotten into action.  Once more grasping the guide bythe arms, the lad ran backward with his heavy burden, with almostmarvelous speed under the circumstances.He was none too soon.  Back of him he could hear Ned stumbling overrails and ties with his burden.  Then came the heart-rending crash.The car of ore had plunged into the wreck of their empty car, hurlingrocks in all directions.  Had they remained where they had been, therewould have been none left to tell the story of their experiences."I guess it's all over," shouted Ned. "But, there will be more, soon,and some of them may hit us."In obedience to Tad's command, Ned dragged Walter along a few rodsfurther, where on a curve both boys laid down their burdens.Tom Phipps under the rough treatment that he had received was stirringand making an effort to sit up.  Tad helped him along by slapping himvigorously between the shoulders.  Ned was shaking Walter almostsavagely."Wake up, Walt!  Wake up!  What's the matter with you?"Walter groaned.By this time Tom Phipps had partially pulled himself together.Tad's heart leaped with joy."Walt will be all right in a minute, I guess," Ned informed him."And so will Mr. Phipps.""Where am I?" asked the young engineer."We've had an accident, Mr. Phipps," replied Tad.  "How do you feel?""As if I had been put through the ore mill.  Did we have a smash?""I should say we did?""Who's hurt?""Walter was knocked out too, but he is coming round now.  Ned thinksthe boy is not hurt very badly.""No, I'm half scared to death, but I'm all right otherwise," answeredWalter for himself."Which track are we on?" demanded Phipps suddenly, trying to locatehis position."Our own.  You nearly got run over on the other.  I pulled you offjust in time.""I'll thank you later.  There must be a cross cut near here.  If wecan find it we'll be able to get to a point where I can telephone themto hold back the cars.  They'll fill the tunnel before they knowanything has happened, if I don't get word to them at once.""I should think they would miss the cars.""They should," answered the engineer.  "Is your friend able to walk?""How about it, Walter?" called Tad."Yes, I can run if it will take me out of this terrible place anysooner.""Then we'll run," decided Tom Phipps.  "I must have gotten an awfulhit on my right leg, for I can scarcely bear my weight upon it.""Shall I rub it for you?" asked Tad."No, we haven't time.  We must look for that cross cut, which leadsinto the number eleven drift.  Keep to your right, boys.  We are safehere now, but not on the other track.""I know that," answered Tad.  He shuddered as he recalled the black,projectile-like object that had whisked by him just after he hadpulled Mr. Phipps from the return track.There was still another reason why the assistant superintendent was sofilled with anxiety to reach a place where he could notify theterminals to stop the cars.  He did not confide this to his youngfriends, not wishing to disturb them any more than they had been.All hands started on a trot, now stumbling, now falling, but without asingle murmur, or protest."You are a nervy bunch of boys.  Never saw anything to equal you,"gasped the engineer.  "I can't forgive myself for getting you intothis wretched mix-up.""You never mind us.  We're all right," answered Tad brightly.  "I'msorry you got knocked out so.""Here's the cross cut," cried the miner.  He had paused and wascautiously feeling his way along the wet, slippery wall.The boys breathed a sigh of relief."Now run as if the Indians were after you.  I'm in a bigger hurry thanI ever have been in my life."And run they did.The boys had no idea what Tom Phipps's reasons were for urging suchhaste upon them, but they knew they must be urgent ones.Tad found himself wondering what new peril might be facing them.  Hedecided that the assistant superintendent must be seeking to protectthe company's property by stopping the sending of more cars throughthe tunnel.  Yet, if this were so, why had the guide urged them tosuch haste."No," said Tad to himself, "it's something that we don't know anythingabout.  But unless I am greatly mistaken we are going to find outpretty soon."In this the boy was right.  They were to find out what it was that TomPhipps feared, and in a manner that they would not soon forget.The narrow cut through which they were now rushing was little higherthan their heads, and was very narrow, so that by raising their elbowsthey could barely touch the sides and keep themselves in the middle ofthe passage way."Look out for a turn just ahead," warned Phipps.  "After that it isstraight away."The turn which they made a few seconds later, Tad imagined, led backtoward the place where the car had started from.  But they came to theend of the passage abruptly.They caught a faint click, and instantly they were surrounded bydazzling light.  As soon as they became used to the brightness theydiscovered that they were in a sort of chamber which looked as if ithad been worn out by constant and long action of water.Instantly upon switching on the light, the young engineer sprang to atelephone on the wall.  Tad observed that the wires from it followedout into the passage through which they had entered.The assistant superintendent was telephoning now, and the ladslistened intently."Hello, hello!" called Phipps in an impatient voice.  "Yes, who'sthis?  Acomb?  Say, Acomb, there's been a wreck on the number onetrack just west of here.  Two cars smashed, one loaded the othercarrying myself and some young men, guests of the company.  Don't letany more through until the wreck is cleared away.  Send an empty alongwith the wrecking crew so we can get out.  What's that?"Tom Phipps shuffled his feet about nervously on the stone floor."Hurry then, hurry!  Yes, we're all here, but hurry!"The boys instinctively drew near.  They imagined that they could heareach other's hearts beat, so tense was the silence.He turned halfway around to glance at the boys."Is it anything serious?" asked Ned in a strained voice."I hope not.  I can't tell you just yet.  We shall know in a minute...Well, send some one for him," he snapped, answering something the manat the other end of the line had said to him.  "Hello, hello!  Thatyou, Bob?  Did Acomb tell you of our predicament?  Yes.  What I wantedto say was don't for goodness' sake send out the red car while theline is blocked.""The red car," repeated Ned and Tad in one voice.  Neither knew whatit meant, but impressed them just the same."What, gone? gone?" groaned Phipps.  "Are you sure?  How long ago?Ten minutes?  Shut off the current!  Quick!  I hope so."The assistant superintendent hung up the telephone deliberately andturned toward them.The boys observed that his face was white and drawn."What, what is it?" asked Tad."There's a car of dynamite coming through the tunnel on the number twotrack," announced the young engineer calmly, thrusting both hands deepinto his trousers pockets.CHAPTER XXIIMPRISONED IN A MINE"That--that's the track that the empty cars go back on, is it not?"asked Tad, after an interval of tense silence."Yes.""The wreck was on the other track."Tom Phipps nodded."Then what harm can the red car, as you call it, do?" interrupted NedRector."That remains to be seen.  The chances are that the number two trackwas blocked when the car of ore was spilled out.""Which means?" questioned Tad."That there may be another collision," smiled the assistantsuperintendent.  His was a wan smile, however, and failed to enliventhe Pony Rider Boys."Will the dynamite explode?" asked Walter half fearfully."Probably not.  I hope not.  But you can't tell anything about thesehigh explosives.  They're very freaky.  All we can do will be toremain here and wait for the car either to stop somewhere after thepower has been turned off or to rip its way through the wreck we justleft.  At any rate we are safe in here."The boys breathed a sigh of relief."Then, there is no danger to us?" asked Ned Rector."The danger is minimized.""How far are we from where we started?""Probably a couple of miles.""My! the Professor will be half scared to death when he hears what afix we are in," half laughed Ned."The foreman, Mr. Acomb, said he would telephone to the other end ofthe drift telling them we were all right and not to worry about us,"said Phipps.  This relieved the boys' minds of one source of worry."Hark!" cautioned the young engineer.The lads ceased their talking instantly and listened with strainingears."What is it?" breathed Tad."It's a car going through the tunnel.""Is--is it the red car?""I don't know.  It's a gravity car--traveling along down grade by itsown weight, so it must be on track two.""What can we do?" asked Ned."Not a thing, my boy, only keep cool.  It will not help matters any toget excited.""We are not!" replied Ned firmly.  Each of the other two boysprotested that they had never been less excited, which brought anapproving smile from their guide, who was filled with admiration forthe plucky lads.  The fact is, his admiration had been steadilygrowing since he had seen their achievements from the time Tad Butlerhad first staggered into the Red Star mining camp a few days before."I guess the car is going through safely. I am glad--"Tom Phipps did not finish the sentence. He was interrupted in a waythat shook all the speech out of him, as it did from the rest of theparty.There occurred a sudden sharp tremor of the rocks about them; then thestones beneath their feet seemed to heave up and down.  Their littleuniverse was being turned topsy-turvy, it seemed to them.At the first tremor, the Pony Rider Boys were thrown prone upon theirfaces on the rocky floor, partially stunned by the sudden shock.  Adistant boom, like the report of a cannon sounded in their ears, thenall at once a terrifying rending of the rocks about them, accompaniedby loud crashes."Are you all right?" shouted Mr. Phipps after the deadening effect ofthe shock had passed."I'm all right," returned Ned Rector.  "Can't anything kill me now.I'm proof against bullets, wrecks and earthquakes.""Was that an earthquake?" questioned Walter weakly."Dynamite.  The red car exploded when it was wrecked," explained themining engineer.  "That was what I feared.  Is Master Tad hurt?""No, he's all right, I guess," answered Tad for himself.  "All thelights have gone out.  Can't we turn them on again?""I'm afraid not.  The wires undoubtedly have been torn and twistedapart in many places.  There will be no more light in this drift forsome time to come, I reckon.""Think anyone was killed?" asked Walter apprehensively."Oh, no.  There was no one near the explosion, except ourselves, andluckily we are safe and sound.  I'll try the telephone."Mr. Phipps spun the handle of the telephone, but without result."Like the lights, it's dead," he said."What was that crashing noise in here?  Was that what did it?"questioned Tad.The miner struck a match."Look!" he exclaimed.In the center of the chamber was a heap of rocks, weighing probably aton or more.  These had been wrenched from the roof of the place anddropped into the room where Phipps and the lads were waiting."Somehow, I'm feeling a goneness under my belt," spoke up Ned.  "Let'sget out of here.""My goneness is in my knees," Walter Perkins informed them."Either place is bad enough," returned Ned."Do you think it safe for us to leave here now?" asked Tad."I have been waiting until I thought it was," answered the guide.  "Ofcourse, I have no means of knowing how much the explosion has loosenedthe rocks further out, near where the blast was fired.""That's so," agreed the boys."We may have to face still other dangers, but I think we had bettermake a start.  I am not sure that these rocks over our heads are anytoo secure, either.  Have you boys any matches?""Yes, I have some," replied Tad."I'll use mine first, then.  We'll need all we have before we get outinto the car tunnel," said Tom.  "Are you getting hungry?""To tell the truth, I for one haven't had time to think about myappetite," laughed Ned."Yes, I guess our minds have been so full of other things that ourstomachs have not had a chance to make their wants known," said Tad."How about you, Walt?""What I want most of anything in the world just at this minute, is tosee daylight.  Isn't night outside yet, is it?""No, it is only just past noon," the miner informed him."Always have a total eclipse of the sun down here," muttered Nedhumorously, but no one paid any attention to his feeble joke."If you are ready we will be going now," announced their guide.  "Fallin behind me and go very carefully.  You are liable to stumble overfallen rocks and break some bones.  That's almost as bad as being hiton the head by one, eh?""Well, hardly," laughed Ned.  "I've got that experience coming to mestill, and I'm in no hurry to meet it.""Keep as far to the side of this chamber as possible," directed Mr.Phipps.  He proceeded ahead of them, lighting the way with matches,which served to relieve the darkness a little, casting weird,flickering shadows on the damp walls and ceiling of the narrowpassage.To the miner's gratification, the tunnel appeared not to have beenharmed at all, not a stone having been jarred loose so far as he wasable to observe."I guess we are in luck, boys," he said in a relieved tone.  "Allclear so far.  We shall be out in the main tunnel in a few minutesnow.  There will be a car along to pick us up very shortly after weget there.""Hurrah!" shouted the lads joyously, hurrying forward in their anxietyto be clear of the place as quickly as possible.  "Can you see the endof the place?""No, not yet."They had just rounded the bend in the tunnel and were heading for theexit into the main cut.  Drawing near to it, they observed that TomPhipps hesitated, then began picking his way along with more cautionthan before."Anything wrong?" asked Tad, who was close behind him."I don't know.  Be careful.  There's a lot of rubbish under footahead.  I don't like the looks of it at all. Stand where you are."After proceeding a few paces, their guide halted, holding a match highabove his head.  He turned toward them slowly."The rocks have caved in, boys.  There's a solid wall in front of us.""Which means," asked Tad hesitatingly."That we are imprisoned far under the surface," answered the minerimpressively.CHAPTER XXIITHE BOYS FACE A MYSTERY"Then how are we going to get out?" asked Ned Rector as the guide'smatch went out."That depends upon how long it takes to dig us out," answered Mr.Phipps."Then they know we are here?" questioned Tad."Oh, yes.  Luckily for us, they do.""Will they have to dig far--is that pile between us and the railroadvery thick?" stammered Ned."It looks so.  Of course I am unable to say what has taken place onthe other side of it.  The entire main cross cut may have tumbled infor all I know.""If it has, what then?" demanded Tad."It will take that much longer to get us out.  That's all.""How long?""Master Ned, I don't know.  No one can answer that question.  Perhapshours--perhaps days," said Tom solemnly."But we'd starve in that time," protested Walter."One can go without food much longer than one would imagine.  Peoplehave fasted for more than a month, as you probably are aware.  No,boys, they will get us out in time.  The only thing that troubles menow is the air," said the engineer."What about it?""Well, we can't live without air, you know.  It seems to be fairlyfresh now, but how long it will continue that way there is no knowing.I'll examine the barrier, but keep back out of the way while I amdoing so."The young engineer climbed over the heap of broken rock in front ofhim, and made a careful inspection of the cave-in that had soeffectually imprisoned them in the drift.He found nothing to encourage him.  The condition of the collapse waseven worse than he had anticipated."Can you pace--measure off by taking a series of long steps?" heasked."Yes," replied Tad promptly."Then please go back to where the bend in the cut begins, and pacedown to where I am."Tad did so promptly, glad to be able to do something to occupy himselfas well as to help relieve the tension for the others."Exactly forty paces," he informed Mr. Phipps."One hundred and twenty feet, eh?"  The engineer made a briefcalculation in his mind.  "One hundred and twenty feet.  H-m-m-m.""Is it as bad as you thought?" questioned Tad."Worse.""Tell me what you have found?""Only forty feet of cave-in between us and freedom.  That's all.""I should say that was enough," muttered the lad."Ample.""Is there anything we can do, Mr. Phipps?" spoke up Ned."Not a thing.  All any of us can do at present is to wait.  Knowing weare here, they will lose no time in attempting to get us out.  I wishthe telephone were working so we might let them know we are all right.We might as well go back.  I'll make a trip out here occasionally tolearn if they are making any signals to us.  They will do this as soonas they can get near enough to the obstruction to make themselvesheard.""Make signals--how?" questioned Ned."We use a code, a telegraph code.  They will rap with a hammer thenwe'll answer them.""But you have no hammer--""No, I'll use a rock to pound with if they get near enough.  There'sno hurry, however.  It will be a long time before there's any occasionto communicate."Turning back, Tom led the way through the passage to the large chamberwhich they had but recently left.  Arriving there, he directed each ofthe lads to light a match at the same time so he could make a surveyof the room to determine whether it were safe for them to remain thereor not."See that hole up there?" he exclaimed."Yes, what is it?" asked Tad."It's a check.  You see there must have been a weakness in the strataat that point--perhaps it had already started to check there, when theforce of the explosion split it wide open.  The opening is largeenough to admit a man's body.  Hold your lights down here while Iexamine this rubbish that has fallen through."They did so, and Mr. Phipps dropping to his knees sorted over thestones and dirt that had fallen from above.At a muttered exclamation from him, the lads crowded closer."Queer, very queer," he mused."What's queer?" asked Ned."Why, this stuff.  It appears to be surface material mixed with piecesof rock of about the same quality as that of which the Ruby Mountainis composed.""I don't understand--""I mean that this material that has fallen in here did not all comeout of the solid rock.""What does that mean?" asked Ned."Perhaps nothing so far as we are concerned.  I was thinking that ifthey could not blast through the drift, they might as a last resort,drill down through the surface from above and pierce this chamber.""How could they locate our position close enough to do that?"  askedTad."That would not be difficult.  From the maps of the mine Mr.  Munsoncould work out our position as closely as a captain does that of hisship at sea."It was a ray of hope which the boys grasped eagerly.  They tried toforget that they were practically entombed many feet underground, andthat days might elapse before they were rescued."I'll bet Chunky will hug himself with delight when he finds outwhat's happened," suggested Walter."Yes, he'll probably think it's very funny, our being bottled up orrather down in a corner underground," said Ned somewhat dolefully."I didn't mean that.  He'll be glad he went hunting instead of comingalong with us," corrected Walter."Yes, I guess he will," agreed Tad.  "He'll have a right tocongratulate himself that he has missed an opportunity to fall in."The lads forgot their predicament for the moment in the laugh thatfollowed."I wish we had a light," said one."We might build a fire.  What's the matter with burning up our hats?"suggested Ned."No, we should be suffocated.  Don't you know we are sealed up,"objected Tad.  "We don't want to make any additional trouble forourselves.""Yes," agreed the guide.  "But it is peculiar that there is so muchfresh air here.  Now and then I can almost imagine I feel a draft,though I know that is not the case.""Could we not get a draft through that large crack in the rocks upthere?""I don't see how, Tad. There is nothing but solid rocks above it."The lad stepped under the opening, holding up a finger which he hadwet between his lips.  For a full moment he stood poised like a statuewhile the other two boys lighted matches that they might the bettersee what he was doing."I don't care what you say, there is air coming from somewhere.  Therecan be no doubt of it.  I feel it plainly.  Try it and see if youdon't agree with me, Mr. Phipps."The engineer stepped up and went through the same process that the boyhad gone through.  He repeated the experiment twice more."You're right," he exclaimed, letting his hand drop to his side."Your good sense is worth more than all my technical knowledge andtraining.""The next question is to find out where the draft comes from.  It mustbe from the outside somewhere," said Tad hopefully."Not necessarily, my boy.  Of course it may be drawn down throughcrevices covering many feet of solid rock before reaching us.  Thenagain, the air may come from some subterranean water course.  As youknow the mountains are full of them, channel upon channel, some highand broad enough to drive a coach and four through.""Oh.  I hoped--""Never mind regrets, boys.  Wherever the air comes from makes littledifference so long as it really is air.  It is saving our lives.""From what?" demanded Walter."From eventual suffocation.  Were it not for that we would stand agood chance of dying before they were able to reach us."The boys were thoughtful for a few moments."Hungry?" questioned the engineer."Somewhat," admitted Tad."We might be more so if we had a chance to think about it," added Ned."I've got a package of chewing gum here.  Help yourself," offeredMr. Phipps.The lads were not slow to do so, and in a moment were chewingindustriously, laughing and talking at the same time."Beats all what a little thing will make a fellow forget histroubles," said Ned.  "Now, I remember--""Hello, boy!""Who said that?" demanded Tad Butler springing up from the pile ofrocks on which he had been sitting for some time."Said what?" snapped Ned.  "I was talking when you interrupted me.""I thought I heard somebody say 'hello,'" confirmed Mr. Phipps."So did I," added Walter."And I know they did," said Tad emphatically."Hello, boy!"This time all sprang up, startled."Who's playing tricks?" shouted Ned."Heard it that time, did you?" asked Walter.  "It wasn't I.""Nor I," chorused Tad."Then it must have been Ned or myself," said Phipps.  "I'm sure that Iam no ventriloquist."For the moment Phipps wondered if they were all losing their senses.He had heard of men, imprisoned under similar circumstances, imaginingthey heard voices.Tad Butler, however, knew that imagination had played no part in thisvoice.  He had heard the voice before.  He informed his companions ofthis fact."Heard it before?  Where?" exclaimed Ned."On top of the Ruby Mountain yesterday," answered the boy.CHAPTER XXIIIIN THE RUBY MOUNTAINTom Phipps nodded.  He recalled his conversation with Tad upon theother's upon his return from his visit to the Ruby Mountain, and thelad's description of the mysterious voice he had heard there.  Mr.Phipps did not give very serious consideration to that part of theboy's story at the time.  Now, however, he was startled beyond words.All of them were startled.  To hear a strange voice many feet downunder the ground, when all supposed they were far beyond the reach ofa human voice, was enough to give almost anyone a start.Yet Tad was not as much surprised as were his companions, for it willbe rememberred he already had been through the experience that was sonew to the others."Who are you?" demanded Mr. Phipps almost sternly.There was no reply to his question."Tad, are you sure that is the same voice?""Positive.  There can be no doubt.  And, besides, she has used thesame words.""But it's impossible," insisted the young engineer.  "No one, letalone a woman, could get near enough to this chamber to be heard asdistinctly as that.""I--I think it must be somebody who can go right through a rock,"stammered Ned."Ghosts," nodded Walter."That's what I thought at first.  But I knew it couldn't be after Ihad time to think twice.  And I--""He-l-l-l-o-o-o!""There it goes again," fairly shouted Tom Phipps.  "I'm going to findout what this means before I'm another minute older."Hastily lighting a match he made a tour of the chamber, every cornerof which he examined carefully, ending by a long, critical survey ofthe hole in the roof."It is just as impossible for anyone to be up there as it is to expectto see some one walk through the solid rocks here beside us," hedecided, throwing the spent match on the floor where it glowed brieflyand went out, leaving the darkness more dense than before.Tad struck a fresh match."Hello, what's this?" he cried, reaching for a small package that laywrapped in a piece of newspaper on the floor near him.  "I didn't seethat before.""Doughnuts!" shouted Ned, who had been peering curiously over Tad'sshoulder as the latter opened the package."Yes, and they are real," exulted Tad.  Already one of them was in hismouth, and the others of the party quickly helped themselves.  Therewas just enough to go around."I don't care who you are, but we're much obliged just the same,"called Ned in a muffled voice."Yes, there's nothing ghostly about this 'bear sign,'" added Tad.As for their companion, Tom Phipps, words failed him."I'm sure I'm going crazy now," he said.  "If you are real, forgoodness' sake tell us who you are and where you are?" he pleaded.A merry, chuckling laugh answered him."She's up there!" said Tad Butler sharply.  He had been listening withevery sense on the alert, determined to locate the owner of the voicewhen next she spoke.  Now he was sure that he had succeeded.  "I knowwhere you are but I don't know how you ever got there.""Do you know a way out of this?" interjected Walter."Of course," answered the girl.Tad nodded to his companions.  They were burning up their matches veryfast now in an effort to catch sight of the owner of the voice."How did you suppose I got there if I didn't know the way?""No ghost about that, I guess," said the boy."Will you help us to get out of here?" asked Tom."Can't.""Why not?" demanded Ned."Can you climb up here?""No, certainly not.""Well, that's the answer."They laughed in spite of themselves."Will you tell us how you got where you are?" asked Mr. Phipps."That's a secret," replied the girl."And I presume your name is a secret too?""Yes.""We'll find out who you are when we get out of here.  I promise youthat," threatened the assistant superintendent."Then good-bye.""No, no, don't go!  Don't go!" begged Tad."Say you won't tell on her, Mr. Phipps.  "Don't you see--""All right, girl, I'll promise to keep your secret.""You'd better," retorted the girl."How did you know we were here?" asked Mr. Phipps."I didn't.  I heard about the explosion, so I came in here to see ifmy cave had been harmed any.""You knew we were right under it, then?""Of course.  How stupid you are!""Where is your cave?""I'm in it.""Yes, I understand that, but where?""You ask too many questions.""Say, young lady, can you find a rope that will reach down to us?"asked Tad, who had been turning over a plan in his mind."I guess.""Please do so then.  And hurry, won't you?""You will ask no questions?""Certainly not!""You won't try to find out anything about my cave?""No, no, of course not," answered Mr. Phipps impatiently."And you will do as I tell you?""Yes.""All right.  I'll be back in a minute."Mr. Phipps sat down nonplussed.  "I never was so mixed up in my life,"he grumbled.  "I can't understand it at all. How did she ever getthere?""She says it's a cave," suggested Tad."But I know of no caves about here."Tad shrugged his shoulders.  That there was one and through it aprospect of their being liberated from their unpleasant and perilousposition, was enough for him to know."Hello," shouted the girl after a few minutes."Yes, did you get the rope?" called Tad excitedly."Uh-huh.""Then drop the end of it down."A heavy coil hit Tad on the top of his head, nearly knocking him down.He scrambled from under while from above there sounded a peal of merrylaughter."I don't care, so long as we have the rope," laughed the boy."Can you fasten the end of the rope to something up there?""No.""Oh, pshaw! that's too bad," grumbled the boy.  "But wait a minute."Striking a match and shading his eyes with one hand, he peered up tothe hole in the rocks.  He noted a long narrowing crevice extendingback from the main opening."I'll tell you what to do.""Yes.""Draw the rope into that crack as far as it will go, then tie a knotin the rope so it cannot slip through.  I'll climb up--""You couldn't get up here.  The end of the crack is too far from theplace you see.  Hold on, here's another crack just like it, right herein the rocks by me.  I'll fix it.  You all promise not to tell on me?"insisted the girl."Yes, yes, yes, we promise.  We'll promise anything just now," laughedNed.An interval of silence followed while the girl was adjusting the endof the rope.  Then she called down to them:"All ready?" asked Tad."Yes, try it."Tad grasped the rope, and swinging himself clear of the floor, jouncedup and down several times."I guess it will hold.  I'll go up first to see that the rope issecure; then the rest of you can follow me up.""Why, I couldn't climb that rope to save my life," objected Mr.Phipps."I'll fix it so you can.  I'll tie some knots in it, then climbingwill be easy."With that Tad once more swung clear of the floor and went up hand overhand with amazing rapidity.  By the light of their matches they sawhim disappear through the hole in the roof of the chamber."It's all right, fellows," he called down to the others.  "I'll justhaul up the rope and fix it for you."This he did, letting the rope down to them a few moments later.Walter was the first to try the climb."I can't do it, Tad. I just can't," he cried, slipping back to thefloor where he landed in a heap."Hold the rope down for him, then he ought to be able to make it,"directed Tad.Walter, however, had apparently lost his courage and declared that hecould not do it."Take a hitch under his arms, good and strong.  I'll pull him up," hecommanded.  They did as the boy above directed, then Tad began hispull.  It was a fearful task."Grab hold of me, put your arms around my waist and brace yourself,"he commanded, and the girl with quick wit comprehended what he wishedher to do.  Slowly, foot by foot Tad hauled the dead weight up.  Thelast few feet of the rope seemed a mile to him.With a final desperate effort, just as his muscles seemed to be at thebreaking point, Tad, hauled his companion safely to the flat rockbeside him, then fell on the floor of the cave, gasping for breath."Le--let the r-rope down," he said faintly.The girl obeyed.Ned shinned it with little difficulty, Tom Phipps insisting that thelad should precede him, though Ned wanted him to go first.Tad was on his feet again."Can you make it?" he called down."I don't know.  I'm going to make a big attempt at it," answered theminer.  They heard the rope creak and knew that he had thrown hisweight upon it."I'm afraid I can't get all the way up.  My arms are giving out," theyheard him gasp."Don't let go!  Don't let go!""I'm afraid I can't help it, my muscles won't stand the strain.""Twist the rope about one leg and rest.  You can hang there all day ifyou'll do that," snapped Tad.  "How is it!""Yes, that works fine.  My arms are all a-tremble.  I didn't suppose Iwas so weak?""You are not used to it, that's all.  That's right; come along.  I'llstrike a match to light the way."Little by little and with frequent rests, Tom worked his way up and upuntil within reach of Tad's strong arm.  The lad grasped him by thecoat collar and pulled him clear of the hole, dropping him flat on hisback safe and sound on the rock where he had previously dumped Walter."Good gracious!" breathed Mr. Phipps.  "Boy, you must be made of castiron.  You--you pulled me up here with one hand.""You're here, that's all we need worry about just now," answered Tad,breathing heavily.  "Now, Miss, will you please tell us how to get outof here?""Come," she said, taking Tad by the hand.  She turned away, the othersfollowing in single file.Almost at once they emerged into a high-ceilinged cave, dimly lightedas if through stained glass windows.The lads uttered an exclamation of amazement."I know you now.  You're Rose Cravath, Tom Cravath's daughter!"  criedPhipps, striding forward and grasping the girl by the shoulder.  "Idemand to know what all this means?"Tad stepped between them, pushing Tom aside."Remember your promise, Mr. Phipps," he warned."Yes, but do you realize where we are, boys?""No, and I don't care.""We're in the Ruby Mountain.""Look!  Look!" shouted Tad excitedly, grasping the arm of Phipps.With this, he dashed away to a distant part of the chamber that lay indeep gloom.  Phipps looked in bewilderment.A few moments later, Tad emerged from the darkness leading a broncho."Didn't I tell you?" he asked triumphantly.  "I knew I'd get him someday--this is my stolen broncho."  And then patting the pony's neckaffectionately, he added: "Good old fellow.  I'm glad to have youagain."He had indeed recovered his pony.  Probably awaiting the departure ofthe Pony Riders from Ruby Mountain, the desperadoes had kept thepony--with two others--secreted in the mountain chamber.  The othertwo ponies did not, however, belong to the Pony Rider Boys, much tothe disgust of the latter."Just Tad's luck," growled Ned.CHAPTER XXIVCONCLUSIONBefore the Pony Rider Boys had an opportunity to voice theirastonishment, Rose held up a hand for silence.  Voices were heardapproaching."Hurry, hurry!" she whispered excitedly, leading the way through alow, narrow opening into another part of the cave.Tom Phipps's hat was knocked off by the low archway, but not realizingthe loss of it, he did not stop.  As they entered the second chamber,which was even more brightly lighted than the one they had just left,they heard the sound of water, but were unable to locate the streamwhich they knew must be near by.The voices died away to a low murmur and the girl who had beentrembling violently, began creeping cautiously toward the opening toreconnoitre when all at once she started back with a little cry ofalarm.Before the eyes of the astonished boys there suddenly appeared twomen.  Mr. Phipps's hat had warned the men of the presence of strangersin their stronghold.  Their faces, therefore, reflected anger insteadof surprise.For a few seconds the newcomers stood glaring at Phipps and the PonyRider Boys."Tom Cravath!" exclaimed the assistant superintendent.  "So, you arethe mystery, are you?""Poaching, eh?" sneered Cravath unabashed."What business you got in here?" snapped his companion."I might ask you the same question, you fellow and Tom Cravath?"retorted Mr. Phipps, holding the two men with a level gaze.  "Andwhat's more I think your peculiar doings will bear looking into.There's something mighty queer about this business.  I shouldn't besurprised if we found we'd solved a greater mystery than we thought--""You'll solve nothing!" shouted Cravath, suddenly drawing a revolver.His companion did likewise, both men quickly covering Tom Phipps andthe boys with their weapons.  "You'll find it ain't profitable tomeddle with other folks' business.""Pity you hadn't learned that lesson yourself," jeered Tom."It's over the cliff for the whole blooming bunch of you.  I'll giveyou all the mystery you want.""Father, father," protested Rose, horrified at her parent'scold-blooded threat.  "They haven't done anything. They--""You shut up!" roared the miner.  "Get out of here!  Get in under thearch there!  I'll attend to you later!"The girl hesitated, then crept away sobbing as Cravath made athreatening move toward her."Now, I'll settle with you and your bunch of meddling tenderfeet,"announced Cravath sternly.  "Right about face!"They hesitated, then turned in obedience to his command.  There seemednothing else for them to do, for both men were fingering their weaponssuggestively."These boys have done nothing to harm you, Cravath," protestedMr. Phipps.  "And no more have I.  Mark me, you'll pay for thisindignity, and dearly too.""You don't say?" sneered the miner."I suppose this is where you hide the ponies you have been stealing,"said Phipps boldly, a sudden thought having come to him."Forward march!" roared the enraged miner."Not--not over the cliff--you--you can't mean it?" begged Phipps, hisface going suddenly pale."That's what I mean.  You fellows are supposed to be buried in themine down there.  It'll take 'em months to blast into the place wherethey think you are, and when they reach the place you all will be gonea long time."Cravath laughed harshly."Come now, over you go, unless you prefer to stand there and take yourmedicine.""Hold on there a minute.  I guess if anybody does the leap for life,it'll be you that does it," shouted a voice behind the two desperatemen.A second dynamite explosion could not have surprised them more.  Themen wheeled like a flash.From the shadow of the archway, through which they had just entered,protruded a rifle barrel.  The Pony Rider Boys who had also turnedsharply at the interruption, observed that the gun barrel had atelescope attachment.  Their eyes following further back, observedsomething else, too."Chunky!" gasped the lads in one voice.Cravath made a move to level his weapon at the boy who had interferedwith his plans thus unexpectedly."You stop that, now!  I've got six bullets in this gun.  If you get meexcited I may press too hard on the trigger, and--well, maybe you'llthink you've stepped into a hornets' nest.  Drop those pistols!"The muzzle of the repeating rifle never wavered.  Behind the sights,the eyes of Stacy Brown had contracted into two narrow slits.The desperadoes hesitated, measuring their chances shrewdly.  Theymust have considered that these were not worth the taking, for theypermitted their fingers to relax, the weapons falling to the floorwith a clatter.Chunky lowered his rifle ever so little, and the Pony Riders uttered ayell of triumph.For one brief instant Chunky was off his guard.  In that second helost his prisoners.With a bound the two men cleared the intervening space that laybetween them and the cliff.  They reached it at a point near thecorner of the chamber some distance from where they had attempted todrive the boys over.  Throwing themselves flat on their faces, theywriggled over the edge and disappeared.  A faint splash below, a fewseconds later, told the lads that their desperate assailants hadreached the water."They'll drown, they'll drown!" cried Walter."No such luck," growled Tom Phipps.  "They've got away, that's all.They know what they're doing."Chunky swaggered to the edge with rifle dropped over his left arm, andpeered over."Guess I'll hurry 'em along," he announced, clearing his weapon foraction.Tad sprang forward and forced the barrel up."Chunky, Chunky!" he warned."I was just going to scare 'em, that's all," grinned the fat boy,lowering his rifle.At that moment the boys fell upon Chunky, fairly hugging him in theirdelight. After the keen edge of their excitement had worn off, theypressed him for the story of how he had happened to find his way intothe Ruby Mountain at that time.The lad explained that having been hunting in that vicinity andbecoming tired out he had sat down to rest.  While thus engaged themen had come along.  They were talking of the explosion, and from themhe learned that the drift in which the Pony Rider Boys were imprisonedwas immediately beneath their hiding place in the Ruby Mountain.Interested at once, the lad followed them into the mountain."But, how did they get in here?" demanded Tom."Through a hole in the rocks, that went straight in."Phipps insisted on being taken to the place at once.  He found thatentrance had been made through an abandoned shaft that extended intothe mountain a short distance on the level.  A door had been skilfullyconstructed, shutting off the entrance to the cave itself.  Yearsbefore a notorious band of outlaws had been known to have a hidingplace somewhere in the vicinity.  Tom Cravath and his associates hadcome upon it and used it for their own nefarious purposes."I think we'll find we've come upon a very important discovery,"decided Mr. Phipps after listening to the fat boy's story.  And so itproved.Cravath had been at the head of a band of thieves, who made way withtheir plunder through the Ruby Mountain.  A large quantity of it wasfound there on the following day.  As for the stock which they stole,this was led into the mine entrance, down into a subterranean watercourse along which it was directed for several miles along towards theIndian Territory where it was eventually sold by other members of thegang.No trace of any of the desperate band was ever found.  Eagle-eye, themissing Indian guide, was discovered bound and gagged in a remotechamber in the Ruby Mountain, weak from loss of food.  He had caughtsome of the band stealing the ponies and they had taken him prisoner.It was proved, however, that neither Rose Cravath nor her mother hadany knowledge of the transactions of the desperate band.Great was the rejoicing in the mining camp when the news of thediscovery became noised about.  The lads were made heroes by theenthusiastic miners.  But this did not bring back the lost ponies.Rather than purchase others for the brief time they would be in theOzarks, it was decided to close the trip and continue theirjourneyings amidst other scenes.On the second morning after their exciting experiences in the minesthey rode away, bound for the nearest railroad station, allanticipation at the prospect of a sojourn on the great Nevada desert,of which they had heard so much.  How they lost themselves there,their efforts to extricate themselves from the desert maze, attendedby a remarkable series of strange happenings, will be told in afollowing volume entitled, "THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE ALKALI."THE END*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE OZARKS ***This file should be named prboz10.txt or prboz10.zipCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, prboz11.txtVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, prboz10a.txtProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the USunless a copyright notice is included.

A number of separate discourses on a variety ofsubjects necessarily labours under the disadvantage of want ofcontinuity, and also under that of a liability to the frequentrepetition of similar ideas and expressions, and the reader will,I trust, pardon these defects as inherent in the circumstances ofthe work. At the same time it will be found that, although notspecially so designed, there is a certain progressive developmentof thought through the dozen lectures which compose this volume,the reason for which is that they all aim at expressing the samefundamental idea, namely that, though the laws of the universecan never be broken, they can be made to work under specialconditions which will produce results that could not be producedunder the conditions spontaneously provided by nature. This is asimple scientific principle and it shows us the place which isoccupied by the personal factor, that, namely, of an intelligencewhich sees beyond the present limited manifestation of the Lawinto its real essence, and which thus constitutes theinstru-mentality by which the infinite possibilities of the Lawcan be evoked into forms of power, usefulness, and beauty.The more perfect, therefore, the working of the personal factor,the greater will be the results developed from the Universal Law;and hence our lines of study should be two-fold--on the one handthe theoretical study of the action of Universal Law, and on theother the practical fitting of ourselves to make use of it; andif the present volume should assist any reader in this two-foldquest, it will have answered its purpose.The different subjects have necessarily been treated verybriefly, and the addresses can only be considered as suggestionsfor lines of thought which the reader will be able to work outfor himself, and he must therefore not expect that carefulelabora-tion of detail which I would gladly have bestowed had Ibeen writing on one of these subjects exclusively. This littlebook must be taken only for what it is, the record of somewhatfragmentary talks with a very indulgent audience, to whom Igratefully dedicate the volume.JUNE 5, 1909.T.T.THE DORE LECTURESENTERING INTO THE SPIRIT OF IT.We all know the meaning of this phrase in our everyday life. TheSpirit is that which gives life and movement to anything, in factit is that which causes it to exist at all. The thought of theauthor, the impression of the painter, the feeling of themusician, is that without which their works could never have comeinto being, and so it is only as we enter into the IDEA whichgives rise to the work, that we can derive all the enjoyment andbenefit from it which it is able to bestow. If we cannot enterinto the Spirit of it, the book, the picture, the music, aremeaningless to us: to appreciate them we must share the mentalattitude of their creator. This is a universal principle; if wedo not enter into the Spirit of a thing, it is dead so far as weare concerned; but if we do enter into it we reproduce inourselves the same quality of life which called that thing intoexistence.Now if this is a general principle, why can we not carry it to ahigher range of things? Why not to the highest point of all? Maywe not enter into the originating Spirit of Life itself, and soreproduce it in ourselves as a perennial spring of livingness?This, surely, is a question worthy of our careful consideration.The spirit of a thing is that which is the source of its inherentmovement, and therefore the question before us is, what is thenature of the primal moving power, which is at the back of theendless array of life which we see around us, our own lifeincluded? Science gives us ample ground for saying that it is notmaterial, for science has now, at least theoretically, reducedall material things to a primary ether, universally distributed,whose innumerable particles are in absolute equilibrium; whenceit follows on mathematical grounds alone that the initialmovement which began to concentrate the world and all materialsubstances out of the particles of the dispersed ether, could nothave originated in the particles themselves. Thus by a necessarydeduction from the conclusions of physical science, we arecompelled to realize the presence of some immaterial powercapable of separating off certain specific areas for the displayof cosmic activity, and then building up a material universe withall its inhabitants by an orderly sequence of evolution, in whicheach stage lays the foundation for the development of the stage,which is to follow--in a word we find ourselves brought face toface with a power which exhibits on a stupendous scale, thefaculties of selection and adaptation of means to ends, and thusdistributes energy and life in accordance with a recognizablescheme of cosmic progression. It is therefore not only Life, butalso Intelligence, and Life guided by Intelligence becomesVolition. It is this primary originating power which we mean whenwe speak of "The Spirit," and it is into this Spirit of the wholeuniverse that we must enter if we would reproduce it as a springof Original Life in ourselves.Now in the case of the productions of artistic genius we knowthat we must enter into the movement of the creative mind of theartist, before we can realize the principle which gives rise tohis work. We must learn to partake of the feeling, to findexpression for which is the motive of his creative activity. Maywe not apply the same principle to the Greater Creative Mind withwhich we are seeking to deal? There is something in the work ofthe artist which is akin to that of original creation. His work,literary, musical, or graphic is original creation on a miniaturescale, and in this it differs from that of the engineer, which isconstructive, or that of the scientist which is analytical; forthe artist in a sense creates something out of nothing, andtherefore starts from the stand-point of simple feeling, and notfrom that of a pre-existing necessity. This, by the hypothesis ofthe case, is true also of the Parent Mind, for at the stage wherethe initial movement of creation takes place, there are noexisting conditions to compel action in one direction more thananother. Consequently the direction taken by the creative impulseis not dictated by outward circumstances, and the primarymovement must therefore be entirely due to the action of theOriginal Mind upon itself; it is the reaching out of this Mindfor realization of all that it feels itself to be.The creative process thus in the first instance is purely amatter of feeling--exactly what we speak of as "motif" in a workof art.Now it is this original feeling that we need to enter into,because it is the fons et origo of the whole chain of causationwhich subsequently follows. What then can this original feelingof the Spirit be? Since the Spirit is Life-in-itself, its feelingcan only be for the fuller expression of Life--any other sort offeeling would be self-destructive and is therefore inconceivable.Then the full expression of Life implies Happiness, and Happinessimplies Harmony, and Harmony implies Order, and Order impliesProportion, and Proportion implies Beauty; so that in recognizingthe inherent tendency of the Spirit towards the production ofLife, we can recognise a similar inherent tendency to theproduction of these other qualities also; and since the desire tobestow the greater fulness of joyous life can only be describedas Love, we can sum up the whole of the feeling which is theoriginal moving impulse in the Spirit as Love and Beauty--theSpirit finding expression through forms of beauty in centres oflife, in harmonious reciprocal relation to itself. This is ageneralized statement of the broad principle by which Spiritexpands from the innermost to the outermost, in accordance with aLaw of tendency inherent in itself.It sees itself, as it were, reflected in various centres of lifeand energy, each with its appropriate form; but in the firstinstance these reflections can have no existence except withinthe originating Mind. They have their first beginning as mentalimages, so that in addition to the powers of Intelligence andSelection, we must also realise that of Imagination as belongingto the Divine Mind; and we must picture these powers as workingfrom the initial motive of Love and Beauty.Now this is the Spirit that we need to enter into, and the methodof doing so is a perfectly logical one. It is the same method bywhich all scientific advance is made. It consists in firstobserving how a certain law works under the conditionsspontaneously provided by nature, next in carefully consideringwhat principle this spontaneous working indicates, and lastlydeducing from this how the same principle would act underspecially selected conditions, not spontaneously provided bynature.The progress of shipbuilding affords a good example of what Imean. Formerly wood was employed instead of iron, because woodfloats in water and iron sinks; yet now the navies of the worldare built of iron; careful thought showed the law of floatationto be that anything could float which, bulk for bulk, is lighterthan the mass of liquid displaced by it; and so we now make ironfloat by the very same law by which it sinks, because by theintroduction of the PERSONAL factor, we provide conditions whichdo not occur spontaneously--according to the esoteric maxim that"Nature unaided fails." Now we want to apply the same process ofspecializing a generic Law to the first of all Laws, that of thegeneric life-giving tendency of Spirit itself. Without theelement of INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY the Spirit can only workcosmically by a GENERIC Law; but this law admits of far higherspecialization, and this specialization can only be attainedthrough the introduction of the personal factor. But to introducethis factor the individual must be fully aware of the PRINCIPLEwhich underlies the spontaneous or cosmic action of the law.Where, then, will he find this principle of Life? Certainly notby contemplating Death. In order to get a principle to work inthe way we require it to, we must observe its action when it isworking spon" taneously in this particular direction. We must askwhy it goes in the right direction as far as it does--and havinglearnt this we shall then be able to make it go further. The lawof floatation was not discovered by contemplating the sinking ofthings, but by contemplating the floating of things which floatednaturally, and then intelligently asking why they did so.The knowledge of a principle is to be gained by the study of itsaffirmative action; when we understand THAT we are in a positionto correct the negative conditions which tend to prevent thataction.Now Death is the absence of Life, and disease is the absence ofhealth, so to enter into the Spirit of Life we require tocontemplate it, where it is to be found, and not where it is not--we are met with the old question, "Why seek ye the living amongthe dead?" This is why we start our studies by considering thecosmic creation, for it is there that we find the Life Spiritworking through untold ages, not merely as deathless energy, butwith a perpetual advance into higher degrees of Life. If we couldonly so enter into the Spirit as to make it personally INOURSELVES what it evidently is in ITSELF, the magnum opus wouldbe accomplished. This means realizing our life as drawn directfrom the Originating Spirit; and if we now understand that theThought or Imagination of the Spirit is the great reality ofBeing, and that all material facts are only correspondences, thenit logically follows that what we have to do is to maintain ourindividual place in the Thought of the Parent Mind.We have seen that the action of the Originating Mind must needsbe GENERIC, that is according to types which include multitudesof individuals. This type is the reflection of the Creative Mindat the level of that particular GENIUS; and at the human level itis Man, not as associated with particular circumstances, but asexisting in the absolute ideal.In proportion then as we learn to dissociate our conception ofourselves from particular circumstances, and to rest upon ourABSOLUTE nature, as reflections of the Divine ideal, we, in ourturn, reflect back into the Divine Imagination its originalconception of itself as expressed in generic or typical Man, andso by a natural law of cause and effect, the individual whorealizes this mental attitude enters permanently into the Spiritof Life, and it becomes a perennial fountain of Life springing upspontaneously within him.He then finds himself to be as the Bible says, "the image andlikeness of God." He has reached the level at which he affords anew starting point for the creative process, and the Spirit,finding a personal centre in him, begins its work de nova, havingthus solved the great problem of how to enable the Universal toact directly upon the plane of the Particular.It is in this sense, as affording the requisite centre for a newdeparture of the creative Spirit, that man is said to be a"microcosm," or universe in miniature; and this is also what ismeant by the esoteric doctrine of the Octave, of which I may beable to speak more fully on some other occasion.If the principles here stated are carefully considered, they willbe found to throw light on much that would otherwise be obscure,and they will also afford the key to the succeeding essays.The reader is therefore asked to think them out carefully forhimself, and to note their connection with the subject of thenext article.INDIVIDUALITY.Individuality is the necessary complement of the UniversalSpirit, which was the subject of our consideration last Sunday.The whole problem of life consists in finding the true relationof the individual to the Universal Originating Spirit; and thefirst step towards ascertaining this is to realize what theUniversal Spirit must be in itself. We have already done this tosome extent, and the conclusions we have arrived at are:--That the essence of the Spirit is Life, Love, and Beauty.That its Motive, or primary moving impulse, is to express theLife, Love and Beauty which it feels itself to be.That the Universal cannot act on the plane of the Particularexcept by becoming the particular, that is by expression throughthe individual.If these three axioms are clearly grasped, we have got a solidfoundation from which to start our consideration of the subjectfor to-day.The first question that naturally presents itself is,If these things be so, why does not every individual express thelife, love, and beauty of the Universal Spirit? The answer tothis question is to be found in the Law of Consciousness. Wecannot be conscious of anything except by realizing a certainrelation between it and ourselves. It must affect us in some way,otherwise we are not conscious of its existence; and according tothe way in which it affects us we recognize ourselves as standingrelated to it. It is this self-recognition on our own partcarried out to the sum total of all our relations, whetherspiritual, intellectual, or physical, that constitutes ourrealization of life. On this principle, then, for the REALIZATIONof its own Livingness, the production of centres of life, throughits relation to which this conscious realization can be attained,becomes a necessity for the Originating Mind. Then it followsthat this realization can only be complete where the individualhas perfect liberty to withhold it; for otherwise no truerealization could have taken place. For instance, let us considerthe working of Love. Love must be spontaneous, or it has noexistence at all. We cannot imagine such a thing as mechanicallyinduced love. But anything which is formed so as to automaticallyproduce an effect without any volition of its own, is.nothing buta piece of mechanism. Hence if the Originating Mind is to realizethe reality of Love, it can Only be by relation to some beingwhich has the power to withhold love. The same applies to therealization of all the other modes of livingness; so that it isonly in proportion, as the individual life is an independentcentre of action, with the option of acting either positively ornegatively, that any real life has been produced at all. Thefurther the created thing is from being a merely mechanicalarrangement, the higher is the grade of creation. The solarsystem is a perfect work of mechanical creation, but toconstitute centres which can reciprocate the highest nature ofthe Divine Mind, requires not a mechanism, however perfect, but amental centre which is, in itself, an independent source ofaction. Hence by the requirements of the case man should becapable of placing himself either in a positive or a negativerelation to the Parent Mind, from which he originates; otherwisehe would be nothing more than a clockwork figure.In this necessity of the case, then, we find the reason why thelife, love, and beauty of the Spirit are not visibly reproducedin every human being. They ARE reproduced in the world of nature,so far as a mechanical and automatic action can represent them,but their perfect reproduction can only take place on the basisof a liberty akin to that of the Originating Spirit itself, whichtherefore implies the liberty of negation as well as ofaffirmation.Why, then, does the individual make a negative choice? Because hedoes not understand the law of his own individuality, andbelieves it to be a law of limitation, instead of a Law ofLiberty. He does not expect to find the starting point of theCreative Process reproduced within himself, and so he looks tothe mechanical side of things for the basis of his reasoningabout life. Consequently his reasoning lands him in theconclusion that life is limited, because he has assumedlimitation in his premises, and so-logically cannot escape fromit in his conclusion. Then he thinks that this is the law and soridicules the idea of transcending it. He points to the sequenceof cause and effect, by which death, disease, and disaster, holdtheir sway over the individual, and says that sequence is law.And he is perfectly right so far as he goes--it is a law; but notTHE Law. When we have only reached this stage of comprehension,we have yet to learn that a higher law can include a lower one socompletely as entirely to swallow it up.The fallacy involved in this negative argument, is the assumptionthat the law of limitation is essential in all grades of being.It is the fallacy of the old shipbuilders as to the impossibilityof building iron ships. What is required is to get at thePRINCIPLE which is at the back of the Law in its affirmativeworking, and specialize it under higher conditions than arespontaneously presented by nature, and this can only be done bythe introduction of the personal element, that is to say anindividual intelligence capable of comprehending the principle.The question, then, is, what is the principle by which we cameinto being? and this is only a personal application of thegeneral question, How did anything come into being? Now, as Ipointed out in the preceding article, the ultimate deduction fromphysical science is that the originating movement takes place inthe Universal Mind, and is analogous to that of our ownimagination; and as we have just seen, the perfect ideal can onlybe that of a being capable of reciprocating ALL the qualities ofthe Originating Mind. Consequently man, in his inmost nature, isthe product of the Divine Mind imaging forth an image of itselfon the plane of the relative as the complementary to its ownsphere of the absolute.If we will therefore go to the INMOST principle in ourselves,which philosophy and Scripture alike declare to be made in theimage and likeness of God, instead of to the outer vehicles whichit externalizes as instruments through which to function on thevarious planes of being, we shall find that we have reached aprinciple in ourselves which stands in loco dei towards all ourvehicles and also towards our environment. It is above them all,and creates them, however unaware we may be of the fact, andrelatively to them it occupies the place of first cause. Therecognition of this is the discovery of our own relation to thewhole world of the relative. On the other hand this must not leadus into the mistake of supposing that there is nothing higher,for, as we have already seen, this inmost principle or ego isitself the effect of an antecedent cause, for it proceeds fromthe imaging process in the Divine Mind.We thus find ourselves holding an intermediate position betweentrue First Cause, on the one hand, and the world of secondarycauses on the other, and in order to understand the nature ofthis position, we must fall back on the axiom that the Universalcan only work on the plane of the Particular through theindividual. Then we see that the function of the individual is toDIFFERENTIATE the undistributed flow of the Universal intosuitable directions for starting different trains of secondarycausation.Man's place in the cosmic order is that of a distributor of theDivine power, subject, however, to the inherent Law of the powerwhich he distributes. We see one instance of this in ordinaryscience, in the fact that we never create force; all we can do isto distribute it. The very word Man means distributor ormeasurer, as in common with all words derived from the Sanderitroot MN., it implies the idea of measurement, just as in thewords moon, month, mens, mind, and "man," the Indian weight of 801bs.; and it is for this reason that man is spoken of inScripture as a "steward," or dispenser of the Divine gifts. Asour minds become open to the full meaning of this position, theimmense possibilities and also the responsibility contained in itwill become apparent.It means that the individual is the creative centre of his ownworld. Our past experience affords no evidence against this, buton the contrary, is evidence for it. Our true nature is alwayspresent, only we have hitherto taken the lower and mechanicalside of things for our starting point, and so have createdlimitation instead of expansion. And even with the knowledge ofthe Creative Law which we have now attained, we shall continue todo this, if we seek our starting point in the things which arebelow us and not in the only thing which is above us, namely theDivine Mind, because it is only there that we can findillimitable Creative Power. Life is BEING, it is the experienceof states of consciousness, and there is an unfailingcorrespondence between these inner states and our outwardconditions. Now we see from the Original Creation that the stateof consciousness must be the cause, and the correspondingconditions the effect, because at the starting of the creation noconditions existed, and the working of the Creative Mind uponitself can only have been a state of consciousness. This, then,is clearly the Creative Order--from states to conditions. But weinvert this order, and seek to create from conditions to states.We say, If I had such and such conditions they would produce thestate of feeling which I desire; and in so saying we run the riskof making a mistake as to the correspondence, for it may turn outthat the particular conditions which we fixed on are not such aswould produce the desired state. Or, again, though they mightproduce it in a certain degree, other conditions might produce itin a still greater degree, while at the same time opening the wayto the attainment of still higher states and still betterconditions. Therefore our wisest plan is to follow the pattern ofthe Parent Mind and make mental self-recognition our startingpoint, knowing that by the inherent Law of Spirit the corelatedconditions will come by a natural process of growth. Then thegreat self-recognition is that of our relation to the SupremeMind. That is the generating centre and we are distributingcentres; just as electricity is generated at the central stationand delivered in different forms of power by reason of passingthrough appropriate centres of distribution, so that in one placeit lights a room, in another conveys a message, and in a thirddrives a tram car. In like manner the power of the Universal Mindtakes particular forms through the particular mind of theindividual. It does not interfere with the lines of hisindividuality, but works along them, thus making him, not less,but more himself. It is thus, not a compelling power, but anexpanding and illuminating one; so that the more the individualrecognizes the reciprocal action between it and himself, the morefull of life he must become.Then also we need not be troubled about future conditions becausewe know that the All-originating Power is working through us andfor us, and that according to the Law proved by the wholeexisting creation, it produces all the conditions required forthe expression of the Life, Love and Beauty which it is, so thatwe can fully trust it to open the way as we go along. The GreatTeacher's words, "Take no thought for the morrow"--and note thatthe correct translation is "Take no anxious thought"-- are thepractical application of the soundest philosophy. This does not,of course, mean that we are not to exert ourselves. We must doour share in the work, and not expect God to do FOR us what Hecan only do THROUGH us. We are to use our common sense andnatural faculties in working upon the conditions now present. Wemust make use of them, AS FAR AS THEY GO, but we must not try andgo further than the present things require; we must not try toforce things, but allow them to grow naturally, knowing that theyare doing so under the guidance of the All-Creating Wisdom.Following this method we shall grow more and more into the habitof looking to mental attitude as the Key to our progress in Life,knowing that everything else must come out of that; and we shallfurther discover that our mental attitude is eventuallydetermined by the way in which we regard the Divine Mind. Thenthe final result will be that we shall see the Divine Mind to benothing else than Life, Love and Beauty--Beauty being identicalwith Wisdom or the perfect adjustment of parts to whole--and weshall see ourselves to be distributing centres of these primaryenergies and so in our turn subordinate centres of creativepower. And as we advance in this knowledge we shall find that wetranscend one law of limitation after another by finding thehigher law, of which the lower is but a partial expression, untilwe shall see clearly before us, as our ultimate goal, nothingless than the Perfect Law of Liberty--not liberty without Lawwhich is anarchy, but Liberty according to Law. In this way weshall find that the Apostle spoke the literal truth, when hesaid, that we shall become like Him when we see Him AS HE IS,because the whole process by which our individuality is producedis one of reflection of the image existing in the Divine Mind.When we thus learn the Law of our own being we shall be able tospecialize it in ways of which we have hitherto but littleconception, but as in the case of all natural laws thespecialization cannot take place until the fundamental principleof the generic law has been fully realized. For these reasons thestudent should endeavour to realize more and more perfectly, bothin theory and practice, the law of the relation between theUniversal and the Individual Minds. It is that of RECIPROCALaction. If this fact of reciprocity is grasped, it will be foundto explain both why the individual falls short of expressing thefulness of Life, which the Spirit is, and why he can attain tothe fulness of that expression; just as the same law explains whyiron sinks in water, and how it can be made to float. It is theindividualizing of the Universal Spirit, by recognizing itsreciprocity to ourselves, that is the secret of the perpetuationand growth of our own individuality.THE NEW THOUGHT AND THE NEW ORDER.In the two preceding lectures I have endeavoured to reach someconception of what the All-originating Spirit is in itself, andof the relation of the individual to it. So far as we can formany conception of these things at all we see that they areuniversal principles applicable to all nature, and, at the humanlevel, applicable to all men: they are general laws therecognition of which is an essential preliminary to any furtheradvance, because progress is made, not by setting aside theinherent law of things, which is impossible, but by specializingit through presenting conditions which will enable the sameprinciple to act in a less limited manner. Having therefore got ageneral idea of these two ultimates, the universal and theindividual, and of their relation to one another, let us nowconsider the process of specialization. In what does thespecialization of a natural law consist? It consists in makingthat law or principle produce an effect which it could notproduce under the simply generic conditions spontaneouslyprovided by nature. This selection of suitable conditions is thework of Intelligence, it is a process of consciously arrangingthings in a new order, so as to produce a new result. Theprinciple is never new, for principles are eternal and universal;but the knowledge that the same principle will produce newresults when working under new conditions is the key to theunfoldment of infinite possibilities. What we have therefore toconsider is the working of Intelligence in providing specificconditions for the operation of universal principles, so as tobring about new results which will transcend our pastexperiences. The process does not consist in the introduction ofnew elements, but in making new combinations of elements whichare always present; just as our ancestors had no conception ofcarriages that could go without horses, and yet by a suitablecombination of elements which were always in existence, suchvehicles are common objects in our streets today. How, then, isthe power of Intelligence to be brought to bear upon the genericlaw of the relation between the Individual and the Universal soas to specialize it into the production of greater results thanthose which we have hitherto obtained?All the practical attainments of science, which place thecivilized world of to-day in advance of the times of King Alfredor Charlemagne, have been gained by a uniform method, and that avery simple one. It is by always enquiring what is theaffirmative factor in any existing combination, and askingourselves why, in that particular combination, it does not actbeyond certain limits. What makes the thing a success, so far asit goes, and what prevents it going further? Then, by carefullyconsidering the nature of the affirmative factor, we see whatsort of conditions to provide to enable it to express itself morefully. This is the scientific method; it has proved itself truein respect of material things, and there is no reason why itshould not be equally reliable in respect of spiritual thingsalso.Taking this as our method, we ask, What is the affirmative factorin the whole creation, and in ourselves as included in thecreation, and, as we found in the first lecture, this factor isSpirit--that invisible power which concentrates-the primordialether into forms, and endows those forms with various modes ofmotion, from the simply mechanical motion of the planet up to thevolitional motion in man. And, since this is so, the primaryaffirmative factor can only be the Feeling and the Thought of theUniversal Spirit.* Now, by the hypothesis of the case, theUniversal Spirit must be the Pure Essence of Life, and thereforeits feeling and  thought can only be towards the continuallyincreasing expression of the livingness which it is; andaccordingly the specialization, of which we are in search, mustbe along the line of affording it a centre from which it may moreperfectly realize this feeling and express this thought: in otherwords the way to specialize the generic principle of Spirit is byproviding new mental conditions in consonance with its ownoriginal nature.* See my "Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science."The scientific method of enquiry therefore brings us to theconclusion that the required conditions for translating theracial or generic operation of the Spirit into a specializedindividual operation is a new way of THINKING mode of thoughtconcurring with, and not in opposition to, the essential forwardmovement of the Creative Spirit itself. This implies an entirereversal of our old conceptions. Hitherto we have taken forms andconditions as the starting point of our thought and inferred thatthey are the causes of mental states; now we have learnt that thetrue order of the creative process is exactly the reverse, andthat thought and feeling are the causes, and forms and conditionsthe effects. When we have learnt this lesson we have grasped thefoundation principle on which individual specialization of thegeneric law of the creative process becomes a practicalpossibility.New Thought, then, is not the name of a particular sect, but isthe essential factor by which our own future development is to becarried on; and its essence consists in seeing the relation ofthings in a New Order. Hitherto we have inverted the true orderof cause and effect; now, by carefully considering the realnature of the Principle of Causation in itself--causa causans asdistinguished from cause causata--we return to the true order andadopt a new method of thinking in accordance with it.In themselves this order and this method of thinking are not new.They are older than the foundation of the world, for they arethose of the Creative Spirit itself; and all through the agesthis teaching has been handed down under various forms, the truemeaning of which has been perceived only by a few in eachgeneration. But as the light breaks in upon any individual it isa new light to him, and so to each one in succession it becomesthe New Thought. And when anyone reaches it, he finds himself ina New Order. He continues indeed to be included in the universalorder of the cosmos, but in a perfectly different way to what hehad previously supposed; for, from his new standpoint, he findsthat he is included, not so much as a part of the general effect,but as a part of the general cause; and when he perceives this hethen sees that the method of his further advance must be byletting the General Cause flow more and more freely into his ownspecific centre, and he therefore seeks to provide thoughtconditions which will enable him to do so.Then, still employing the scientific method of following up theaffirmative factor, he realizes that this universal causativepower, by whatever name he may call it, manifests as SupremeIntelligence in the adaptation of means to ends. It does so inthe mechanism of the planet, in the production of supply for thesupport of physical life, and in the maintenance of the race as awhole. True, the investigator is met at every turn withindividual failure; but his answer to this is that there is nocosmic failure, and that the apparent individual failure isitself a part of the cosmic process, and will diminish inproportion as the individual attains to the recognition of theMoving Principle of that process, and provides the necessaryconditions to enable it to take a new starting point in his ownindividuality. Now, one of these conditions is to recognize it asIntelligence, and to remember that when working through our ownmentality it in no way changes its essential nature, just aselectricity loses none of its essential qualities in passingthrough the special apparatus which enables it to manifest aslight.When we see this, our line of thought will run something asfollows:--"My mind is a centre of Divine operation. The Divineoperation is always for expansion and fuller expression, and thismeans the production of something beyond what has gone before,something entirely new, not included in past experience, thoughproceeding out of it by an orderly sequence of growth. Therefore,since the Divine cannot change its inherent nature, it mustoperate in the same manner in me; consequently in my own specialworld, of which I am the centre, it will move forward to producenew conditions, always in advance of any that have gone before."This is a legitimate line of argument, from the premisesestablished in the recognition of the relation between theindividual and the Universal Mind; and it results in our lookingto the Divine Mind, not only as creative, but also as directive--that is as determining the actual forms which the conditions forits manifestation will take in our own particular world, as wellas supplying the energy for their production. We miss the pointof the relation between the individual and the universal, if wedo not see that the Originating Spirit is a FORMING power. It isthe forming power throughout nature, and if we would specializeit we must learn to trust its formative quality when operatingfrom its new starting point in ourselves.But the question naturally arises, If this is so, what part istaken by the individual? Our part is to provide a concrete centreround which the Divine energies can play. In the generic order ofbeing we exercise upon it a force of attraction in accordancewith the innate pattern of our particular individuality; and aswe begin to realize the Law of this relation, we, in our turn,are attracted towards the Divine along the lines of leastresistance, that is on those lines which are most natural to ourspecial bent of mind. In this way we throw out certainaspirations with the result that we intensify our attraction ofthe Divine forces in a certain specific manner, and they thenbegin to act both through us and around us in accordance with ouraspirations. This is the rationale of the reciprocal action between the Universal Mind and the individual mind, and this showsus that our desires should not be directed so much to theacquisition of particular THINGS as to the reproduction inourselves of particular phases of the Spirit's activity; andthis, being in its very nature creative, is bound to externalizeas corresponding things and circumstances. Then, when theseexternal facts appear in the circle of our objective life, wemust work upon them from the objective stand-point. This is wheremany fall short of completed work. They realize the subjective orcreative process, but do not see that it must be followed by anobjective or constructive process, and consequently they areunpractical dreamers and never reach the stage of completed work.The creative process brings the materials and conditions for thework to our hands; then we must make use of them with diligenceand common-sense--God will provide the food, but He will not cookthe dinner.This, then, is the part taken by the individual, and it is thusthat he becomes a distributing centre of the Divine energy,neither on the one hand trying to lead it like a blind force, noron the other being himself under a blind unreasoning impulsionfrom it. He receives guidance because he seeks guidance; and heboth seeks and receives according to a Law which he is able torecognize; so that he no more sacrifices his liberty or dwarfshis powers, than does an engineer who submits to the generic lawsof electricity, in order to apply them to some specific purpose.The more intimate his knowledge of this Law of Reciprocitybecomes, the more he finds that it leads on to Liberty, on thesame principle by which we find in physical science that natureobeys us precisely in the same degree to which we first obeynature. As the esoteric maxim has it "What is a truth on oneplane is a truth on all." But the key to this enfranchisement ofbody, mind, and circumstances is in that new thought whichbecomes creative of new conditions, because it realizes the trueorder of the creative process. Therefore it is that, if we wouldbring a new order of Life, Light, and Liberty into our lives wemust commence by bringing a new order into our thought, and findin ourselves the starting point of a new creative series, not bythe force of personal will, but by union with the Divine Spirit,which in the expression of its inherent Love and Beauty, makesall things new.THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT.The three preceding lectures have touched upon certainfundamental truths in a definite order--first the nature of theOriginating Spirit itself, next the generic relation of theindividual to this All-embracing Spirit, and lastly the way tospecialize this relation so as to obtain greater results from itthan spontaneously arise by its merely generic action, and wehave found that this can only be done through a new order ofthought. This sequence is logical because it implies a Power, anIndividual who understands the Power, and a Method of applyingthe power deduced from understanding its nature. These aregeneral principles without realizing which it is impossible toproceed further, but assuming that the reader has grasped theirsignificance, we may now go on to consider their application ingreater detail.Now this application must be a personal one, for it is onlythrough the individual that the higher specialization of thepower can take place, but at the same time this must not lead usto suppose that the individual, himself, brings the creativeforce into being. To suppose this is inversion; and we cannotimpress upon ourselves too deeply that the relation of theindividual to the Divine Spirit is that of a distributor, and notthat of the original creator. If this is steadily borne in mindthe way will become clear, otherwise we shall be led intoconfusion.What, then, is the Power which we are to distribute? It is theOriginating Spirit itself. We are sure that it is this becausethe new order of thought always begins at the beginning of anyseries which it contemplates bringing into manifestation, and itis based upon the fact that the origin of everything is Spirit.It is in this that its creative power resides; hence the personwho is in the true new order of thought assumes as an axiomaticfact that what he has to distribute, or differentiate intomanifestation is nothing else than the Originating Spirit. Thisbeing the case, it is evident that the PURPOSE of thedistribution must be the more perfect expression of theOriginating Spirit as that which it is in itself, and what it isin itself is emphatically Life. What is seeking for expression,then, is the perfect Livingness of the Spirit; and thisexpression is to be found, through ourselves, by means of ourrenewed mode of thought. Let us see, then, how our new order ofthought, with regard to the Principle of Life, is likely tooperate In our old order of thought we have always associatedLife with the physical body--life has been for us the supremephysical fact. Now, however, we know that Life is much more thanthis; but, as the greater includes the less, it includes physicallife as one mode of its manifestation. The true order does notrequire us to deny the reality of physical life or to call it anillusion; on the contrary it sees in physical life the completionof a great creative series, but it assigns it the proper place inthat series, which is what the old mode of thought did not.When we realize the truth about the Creative Process, we see thatthe originating life is not physical: its livingness consists inthought and feeling. By this inner movement it throws outvehicles through which to function, and these become living formsbecause of the inner-principle which is sustaining them; so thatthe Life with which we are primarily concerned in the new orderis the life of thought and feeling in ourselves as the vehicle,or distributing medium, of the Life of the Spirit.Then, if we have grasped the idea of the Spirit as the greatFORMING Power, as stated in the last lecture, we shall seek in itthe fountain-head of Form as well as of Power: and as a logicaldeduction from this we shall look to it to give form to ourthoughts and feelings. If the principle is once recognised thesequence is obvious. The form taken by our outward conditions,whether of body or circumstance, depends on the form taken by ourthoughts and feelings, and our thoughts and feelings will takeform from that source from which we allow them to receivesuggestion. Accordingly if we allow them to accept theirfundamental suggestions from the relative and limited, they willassume a corresponding form and transmit them to our externalenvironment, thus repeating the old order of limitation in aceaselessly recurring round. Now our object is to get out of thiscircle of limitation, and the only way to do so is to get ourthoughts and feelings moulded into new forms continuallyadvancing to greater and greater perfection. To meet thisrequirement, therefore, there must be a forming power greaterthan that of our own unaided conceptions, and this is to be foundin our realization of the Spirit as the Supreme Beauty, orWisdom, moulding our thoughts and feelings into shapesharmoniously adjusted to the fullest expression, in and throughus, of the Livingness which Spirit is in itself.Now this is nothing more than transferring to the innermost planeof origination, a principle with which all readers who are "inthe thought" may be presumed to be quite familiar--the principleof Receptiveness. We all know what is meant by a receptive mentalattitude when applied to healing or telepathy; and does it notlogically follow that the same principle may be applied to thereceiving of life itself from the Supreme Source? What is wanted,therefore, is to place ourselves in a receptive mental attitudetowards the Universal Spirit with the intention of receiving itsforming influence into our mental substance. It is always thepresence of a definite intention that distinguishes theintelligent receptive attitude of mind from a merely sponge-likeabsorbency, which sucks in any and every influence that mayhappen to be floating round: for we must not shut our eyes to thefact that there are various influences in the mental atmosphereby which we are surrounded, and some of them of the mostundesirable kind. Clear and definite intention is therefore asnecessary in our receptive attitude as in our active and creativeone; and if our intention is to have our own thoughts andfeelings moulded into such forms as to express those of theSpirit, then we establish that relation to the Spirit which, bythe conditions of the case, must necessarily lead us to theconception of new ideals vitalised by a power which will enableus to bring them into concrete manifestation. It is in this waythat we become differentiating centres of the Divine Thoughtgiving it expression in form in the world of space and time, andthus is solved the great problem of enabling the Universal to actupon the plane of the particular without being hampered by thoselimitations which the merely generic law of manifestation imposesupon it. It is just here that subconscious mind performs thefunction of a "bridge" between the finite and the infinite asnoted in my "Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science" (page 31), andit is for this reason that a recognition of its susceptibility toimpression is so important.By establishing, then, a personal relation to the life of theSpirit, the sphere of the individual becomes enlarged. The reasonis that he allows a greater intelligence than his own to take theinitiative; and since he knows that this Intelligence is also thevery Principle of Life itself, he cannot have any fear that itwill act in any way to the diminution of his individual life, forthat would be to stultify its own operation--it would beself-destructive action which is a contradiction in terms to theconception of Creative Spirit. Knowing, then, that by itsinherent nature this Intelligence can only work to the expansionof the individual life, we can rest upon it with the utmostconfidence and trust it to take an initiative which will lead tofar greater results than any we could forecast from thestand-point of our own knowledge. So long as we insist ondictating the particular form which the action of the Spirit isto take, we limit it, and so close against ourselves avenues ofexpansion which might otherwise have been open to us; and if weask ourselves why we do this we shall find that in the lastresort it is because we do not believe in the Spirit as a FORMINGpower. We have, indeed, advanced to the conception of it asexecutive power, which will work to a prescribed pattern, but wehave yet to grasp the conception of it as versed in the art ofdesign, and capable of elaborating schemes of construction, whichwill not only be complete in themselves, but also in perfectharmony with one another. When we advance to the conception ofthe Spirit as containing in itself the ideal of Form as well asof Power, we shall cease from the effort of trying to forcethings into a particular shape, whether on the inner or the outerplane, and shall be content to trust the inherent harmoniousnessor Beauty of the Spirit to produce combinations far in advance ofanything that we could have conceived ourselves. This does notmean that we shall reduce ourselves to a condition of apathy, inwhich all desire, expectation and enthusiasm have been quenched,for these are the mainspring of our mental machinery; but on thecontrary their action will be quickened by the knowledge thatthere is working at the back of them a Formative Principle soinfallible that it cannot miss its mark; so that however good andbeautiful the existing forms may be, we may always rest in thehappy expectation of something still better to come. And it willcome by a natural law of growth, because the Spirit is in itselfthe Principle of Increase. They will grow out of presentconditions for the simple reason that if you are to reach somefurther point it can only be by starting from where you are now.Therefore it is written, "Despise not the day of small things."There is only one proviso attached to this forward movement ofthe Spirit in the world of our own surroundings, and that is thatwe shall co-operate with it; and this co-operation consists inmaking the best use of existing conditions in cheerful relianceon the Spirit of Increase to express itself through us, and forus, because we are in harmony with it. This mental attitude willbe found of immense value in setting us free from worry andanxiety, and as a consequence our work will be done in a muchmore efficient manner. We shall do the present work FOR ITS OWNsake, knowing that herein is the principle of unfoldment; anddoing it simply for its own sake we shall bring to bear upon it apower of concentration which cannot fail of good results--andthis quite naturally and without any toilsome effort. We shallthen find that the secret of co-operation is to have faith inourselves because we first have faith in God; and we shalldiscover that this Divine self-confidence is something verydifferent from a boastful egotism which assumes a personalsuperiority over others. It is simply the assurance of a man whoknows that he is working in accordance with a law of nature. Hedoes not claim as a personal achievement what the Law does FORhim: but on the other hand he does not trouble himself aboutoutcries against his presumptuous audacity raised by persons whoare ignorant of the Law which he is employing. He is thereforeneither boastful nor timorous, but simply works on in cheerfulexpectancy because he knows that his reliance is upon a Law whichcannot be broken.In this way, then, we must realize the Life of the Spirit asbeing also the Law of the Spirit. The two are identical, andcannot deny themselves. Our recognition of them gives them a newstarting point through our own mentality, but they still continueto be the same in their nature, and unless limited or inverted byour mental affirmation of limited or inverted conditions, theyare bound to work out into fuller and continually fullerexpression of the Life, Love, and Beauty which the Spirit is initself. Our path, therefore, is plain; it is simply tocontemplate the Life, Love, and Beauty of the Originating Spiritand affirm that we are already giving expression to it in ourthoughts and in our actions however insignificant they may atpresent appear. This path may be very narrow and humble in itsbeginning, but it ever grows wider and mounts higher, for it isthe continually expanding expression of the Life of the Spiritwhich is infinite and knows no limits. ALPHA AND OMEGA.Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last. What does this mean? Itmeans the entire series of causation from the first originatingmovement to the final and completed result. We may take this onany scale from the creation of a cosmos to the creation of alady's robe. Everything has its origin in an idea, a thought; andit has its completion in the manifestation of that thought inform. Many intermediate stages are necessary, but the Alpha andOmega of the series are the thought and the thing. This shows usthat in essence the thing already existed in the thought. Omegais already potential in Alpha, just as in the Pythagorean systemall numbers are said to proceed from unity and to be resolvableback again into it. Now it is this general principle of thealready existence of the thing in the thought that we have to layhold of, and as we find it true in an architect's design of thehouse that is to be, so we find it true in the great work of theArchitect of the Universe. When we see this we have realized ageneral principle, which we find at work everywhere. That is themeaning of a general principle: it can be applied to any sort ofsubject; and the use of studying general principles is to givethem particular application to anything we may have to deal with.Now what we have to deal with most of all is ourselves, and so wecome to the consideration of Alpha and Omega in the human being.In the vision of St. John, the speaker of the words, "I am Alphaand Omega, the First and the Last," is described as "Like unto ason of man"--that is, however transcendent the appearance in thevision, it is essentially human, and thus suggests to us thepresence of the universal principle at the human level. But thefigure in the apocalyptic vision is not that of man as weordinarily know him. It is that of Omega as it subsists enshrinedin Alpha: it is the ideal of humanity as it subsists in theDivine Mind which was manifested in objective form to the eyes ofthe seer, and therefore presented the Alpha and Omega of thatidea in all the majesty of Divine glory.But if we grasp the truth that the thing is already existent inthe thought, do we not see that this transcendent Omega must bealready existent in the Divine ideal of every one of us? If onthe plane of the absolute time is not, then does it not followthat this glorified humanity is a present fact in the DivineMind? And if this is so, then this fact is eternally trueregarding every human being. But if it is true that the thingexists in the thought, it is equally true that the thought findsform in the thing; and since things exist under the relativeconditions of time and space, they are necessarily subject to alaw of Growth, so that while the subsistence of the thing in thethought is perfect ab initio, the expression of the thought inthe thing is a matter of gradual development. This is a pointwhich we must never lose sight of in our studies; and we mustnever lose sight of the perfection of the thing in the thoughtbecause we do not yet see the perfection of the thought in thething. Therefore we must remember that man, as we know him now,has by no means reached the ultimate of his evolution. We areonly yet in the making, but we have now reached a point where wecan facilitate the evolutionary process by conscious co-operationwith the Creative Spirit. Our share in this work commences withthe recognition of the Divine ideal of man, and thus finding thepattern by which we are to be guided. For since the person to becreated after this pattern is ourself, it follows that, bywhatever processes the Divine ideal transforms itself intoconcrete reality, the place where those processes are to workmust be within ourselves; in other words, the creative action ofthe Spirit takes place through the laws of our own mentality. Ifit is a true maxim that the thing must take form in the thoughtbefore the thought can take form in the thing, then it is plainthat the Divine Ideal can only be externalized in our objectivelife in proportion as it is first formed in our thought; and ittakes form in our thought only to the extent to which weapprehend its existence in the Divine Mind. By the nature of therelation between the individual mind and the Universal Mind it isstrictly a case of reflection; and in proportion as the mirror ofour own mind blurs or clearly reflects the image of the Divineideal, so will it give rise to a correspondingly feeble orvigorous reproduction of it in our external life.This being the rationale of the matter, why should we limit ourconception of the Divine ideal of ourselves? Why should we say,"I am too mean a creature ever to reflect so glorious an image"--or "God never intended such a limitless ideal to be reproduced inhuman beings." In saying such things we expose our ignorance ofthe whole Law of the Creative Process. We shut our eyes to thefact that the Omega of completion already subsists in the Alphaof conception, and that the Alpha of conception would be nothingbut a lying illusion if it was not capable of expression in theOmega of completion. The creative process in us is that we becomethe individual reflection of what we realize God to be relativelyto ourselves, and therefore if we realize the Divine Spirit asthe INFINITE potential of all that can constitute a perfectedhuman being, this conception must, by the Law of the CreativeProcess, gradually build up a corresponding image in our mind,which in turn will act upon our external conditions.This, by the laws of mind, is the nature of the process and itshows us what St. Paul means when he speaks of Christ beingformed in us (Gal. iv. 19) and what in another place he callsbeing renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created us(Col. iii. 10). It is a thoroughly logical sequence of cause andeffect, and what we require is to see more clearly the Law ofthis sequence and use it intelligently--that is why St. Paul saysit is being "renewed in knowledge": it is a New Knowledge, therecognition of principles which we had not previouslyapprehended. Now the fact which, in our past experience, we havenot grasped is that the human mind forms a new point of departurefor the work of the Creative Spirit; and in proportion as we seethis more and more clearly, the more we shall find ourselvesentering into a new order of life in which we become less andless subject to the old limitations. This is not a rewardarbitrarily bestowed upon us for holding dogmatically to certainmere verbal statements, but it is the natural result ofunderstanding the supreme law of our own being. On its own planeit is as purely scientific as the law of chemical reaction; onlyhere we are not dealing with the interaction of secondary causesbut with the Self-originating action of Spirit. Hence a new forcehas to be taken into account which does not occur in physicalscience, the power of Feeling. Thought creates form, but it isfeeling that gives vitality to thought. Thought without feelingmay be constructive as in some great engineering work, but it cannever be creative as in the work of the artist or musician; andthat which originates within itself a new order of causation is,so far as all pre-existing forms are concerned, a creation exnihilo, and is therefore Thought expressive of Feeling. It isthis indissoluble union of Thought and Feeling that distinguishescreative thought from merely analytical thought and places it ina different category; and therefore if we are to afford a newstarting-point for carrying on the work of creation it must be byassimilating the feeling of the Originating Spirit as part andparcel of its thought--it is that entering into the Mind of theSpirit of which I spoke in the first address.Now the images in the Mind of the Spirit must necessarily beGENERIC. The reason for this is that by its very nature thePrinciple of Life must be prolific, that is, tending toMultiplicity, and therefore the original Thought-image must befundamental to whole races, and not exclusive to particularindividuals. Consequently the images in the Mind of the Spiritmust be absolute types of the true essentials of the perfectdevelopment of the race, just what Plato meant by architypalideas. This is the perfect subsistence of the thing in thethought. Therefore it is that our evolution as centres ofCREATIVE activity, the exponents of new laws, and through them ofnew conditions, depends on our realizing in the Divine Mind thearchitype of mental perfection, at once as thought and feeling.But when we find all this in the Divine Mind, do we not meet withan infinite and glorious Personality? There is nothing lacking ofall that we can understand by Personality, excepting outwardform; and since the very essence of telepathy is that itdispenses with the physical presence, we find ourselves in aposition of interior communion with a Personality at once Divineand Human. This is that Personality of the Spirit which St. Johnsaw in the apocalyptic vision, and which by the very conditionsof the case is the Alpha and Omega of Humanity.But, as I have said, it is simply GENERIC in itself, and itbecomes active and specific only by a purely personal relation tothe individual. But once more we must realize that nothing cantake place except according to Law, and therefore this specificrelation is nothing arbitrary, but arises out of the generic Lawapplied under specific conditions. And since what makes a lawgeneric is precisely the fact that it does not supply thespecific conditions, it follows that the conditions for thespecializing of the Law must be provided by the individual. Thenit is that his recognition of the originating creative movement,as arising from combined Thought and Feeling, becomes a practicalworking asset. He realizes that there is a Heart and Mind of theSpirit reciprocal to his own heart and mind, that he is notdealing with a filmy abstraction, nor yet with a meremathematical sequence, but with something that is pulsating witha Life as warm and vivid and full of interest as his own--nay,more so, for it is the Infinite of all that he himself is. Andhis recognition goes even further than this, for since thisspecialization can only take place through the individualhimself, it logically follows that the Life, which he thusspecializes, become HIS OWN life. Quoad the individual it doesnot know itself apart from him. But this self-recognition throughthe individual cannot in any way change the inherent nature ofthe Creative Spirit, and therefore to the extent to which theindividual perceives its identification with himself, he placeshimself under its guidance, and so he becomes one of those whoare "led by the Spirit." Thus he begins to find the Alpha andOmega of the Divine ideal reproduced in himself--in a very smalldegree at present, but containing the principle of perpetualgrowth into an infinite expansion of which we can as yet form noconception.St. John sums up the whole of this position in his memorablewords:--"Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yetappear what we SHALL be; but we know that when He shall appear(i.e., become clear to us) we shall be like Him; for (i.e., thereason of all this) we shall see Him as He is" (I. John iii. 2). THE CREATIVE POWER OF THOUGHT.One of the great axioms in the new order of ideas, of which Ihave spoken, is that our Thought possesses creative power, andsince the whole superstructure depends on this foundation, it iswell to examine it carefully. Now the starting point is to seethat Thought, or purely mental action, is the only possiblesource from which the existing creation could ever have come intomanifestation at all, and it is on this account that in thepreceding addresses I have laid stress on the origin of thecosmos. It is therefore not necessary to go over this groundagain, and we will start this morning's enquiry on the assumptionthat every manifestation is in essence the expression of a DivineThought. This being so, our own mind is the expression of aDivine Thought. The Divine Thought has produced something whichitself is capable of thinking; but the question is whether itsthinking has the same creative quality as that of the ParentMind.Now by the very hypothesis of the case the whole Creative Processconsists in the continual pressing so forward of the UniversalSpirit for expression through the individual and particular, andSpirit in its different modes is therefore the Life and Substanceof the universe. Hence it follows that if there is to be anexpression of thinking power it can only be by expressing thesame thinking power which subsists latent in the OriginatingSpirit. If it were less than this it would only be some sort ofmechanism and would not be thinking power, so that to be thinkingpower at all it must be identical in kind with that of theOriginating Spirit. It is for this reason that man is said to becreated in the image and likeness of God; and if we realize thatit is impossible for him to be otherwise, we shall find a firmfoundation from which to draw many important deductions.But if our thought possesses this creative power, why are wehampered by adverse conditions? The answer is, because hithertowe have used our power invertedly. We have taken the startingpoint of our thought from external facts and consequently createda repetition of facts of a similar nature, and so long as we dothis we must needs go on perpetuating the old circle oflimitation. And, owing to the sensitiveness of the subconsciousmind to suggestion--(See Edinburgh Lectures, chapter V.)--we aresubject to a very powerful negative influence from those who areunacquainted with affirmative principles, and thus race-beliefsand the thought-currents of our more immediate environment tendto consolidate our own inverted thinking. It is therefore notsurprising that the creative power of our thought, thus used in awrong direction, has produced the limitations of which wecomplain. The remedy, then, is by reversing our method ofthinking, and instead of taking external facts as our startingpoint, taking the inherent nature of mental power as our startingpoint. We have already gained two great steps in this direction,first by seeing that the whole manifested cosmos could have hadits origin nowhere but in mental power, and secondly by realizingthat our own mental power must be the same in kind with that ofthe Originating Mind.Now we can go a step further and see how this power in ourselvescan be perpetuated and intensified. By the nature of the creativeprocess your mind is itself a thought of the Parent Mind; so, aslong as this thought of the Universal Mind subsists, you willsubsist, for you are it. But so long as you think this thought itcontinues to subsist, and necessarily remains present in theDivine Mind, thus fulfilling the logical conditions required forthe perpetuation of the individual life. A poor analogy of theprocess may be found in a self-influencing dynamo where themagnetism generates the current and the current intensifies themagnetism with the result of producing a still stronger currentuntil the limit of saturation is reached; only in the substantiveinfinitude of the Universal Mind and the potential infinitude ofthe Individual Mind there is no limit of saturation. Or we maycompare the interaction of the two minds to two mirrors, a greatand a small one, opposite each other, with the word "Life"engraved on the large one. Then, by the law of reflection, theword "Life" will also appear on the image of the smaller mirrorreflected in the greater. Of course these are only very imperfectanalogies; but if you car once grasp the idea of your ownindividuality as a thought in the Divine Mind which is able toperpetuate itself by thinking of itself as the thought which itis, you have got at the root of the whole matter, and by the sameprocess you will not only perpetuate your life but will alsoexpand it.When we realize this on the one hand, and on the other that allexternal conditions, including the body, are produced by thought,we find ourselves standing between two infinites, the infinite ofMind and the infinite of Substance--from both of which we candraw what we will, and mould specific conditions out of theUniversal Substance by the Creative Power which we draw in fromthe Universal Mind. But we must recollect that this is not by theforce of personal will upon the substance, which is an error thatwill land us in all sorts of inversion, but by realizing our mindas a channel through which the Universal Mind operates uponsubstances in a particular way, according to the mode of thoughtwhich we are seeking to embody. If, then, our thought ishabitually concentrated upon principles rather than on particularthings, realizing that principles are nothing else than theDivine Mind in operation, we shall find that they willnecessarily germinate to produce their own expression incorresponding facts, thus verifying the words of the GreatTeacher, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousnessand all these things shall be added unto you."But we must never lose sight of the reason for the creative powerof our thought, that it is because our mind is itself a thoughtof the Divine Mind, and that consequently our increase inlivingness and creative power must be in exact proportion to ourperception of our relation to the Parent Mind. In suchconsiderations as these is to be found the philosophical basis ofthe Bible doctrine of "Sonship," with its culmination in theconception of the Christ. These are not mere fancies but theexpression of strictly scientific principles, in theirapplication to the deepest problems of the individual life; andtheir basis is that each one's world, whether in or out of theflesh, must necessarily be created by his own consciousness, and,in its turn, his mode of consciousness will necessarily take itscolour front his conception of his relation to the Divine Mind--to the exclusion of light and colour, if he realizes no DivineMind, and to their building up into forms of beauty in proportionas he realizes his identity of being with that All-OriginatingSpirit which is Light, Love, and Beauty in itself. Thus the greatcreative work of Thought in each of us is to make us consciously"sons and daughters of the Almighty," realizing that by ourdivine origin we can never be really separated from the ParentMind which is continually seeking expression through us, and thatany apparent separation is due to our own misconception of thetrue nature of the inherent relation between the Universal andthe Individual. This is the lesson which the Great Teacher has soluminously out before us in the parable of the Prodigal Son.THE GREAT AFFIRMATIVE.The Great Affirmative appears in two modes, the cosmic and theindividual. In its essence it is the same in both, but in each itworks from a different standpoint. It is always the principle ofBeing--that which is, as distinguished from that which is not;but to grasp the true significance of this saying we mustunderstand what is meant by "that which is not." It is somethingmore than mere non-existence, for obviously we should not troubleourselves about what is non-existent. It is that which bath isand is not at the same time, and the thing that answers to thisdescription is "Conditions." The little affirmative is that whichaffirms particular conditions as all that it can grasp, while thegreat affirmative grasps a wider conception, the conception ofthat which gives rise to conditions. Cosmically it is that powerof Spirit which sends forth the whole creation as its expressionof itself, and it is for this reason that I have drawn attentionin the preceding lectures to the idea of the creation ex nihiloof the whole visible universe. As Eastern and Western Scripturesalike tell us it is the breathing-forth of Original Spirit; andif you have followed what I have said regarding the reproductionof this Spirit in the individual--that by the very nature of thecreative process the human mind must be of the same quality withthe Divine Mind--then we find that a second mode of theOriginating Spirit becomes possible, namely that of operationthrough the individual mind. But whether acting cosmically orpersonally it is always the same Spirit and therefore cannot loseits inherent character which is-that of the Power which createsex nihilo. It is the direct contradiction of the maxim "ex nihilonihil fit"--nothing can be made out of nothing; and it is therecognition of the presence in ourselves of this power, which canmake something out of nothing, that is the key to our furtherprogress. As the logical outcome of the cosmic creative process,the evolutionary work reaches a point where the Originating Powercreates an image of itself; and thus affords a fresh point ofdeparture from which it can work specifically, just as in thecosmic process it works generically. From this new standpoint itdoes not in any way contradict the laws of the cosmic order, butproceeds to specialize them, and thus to bring out resultsthrough the individual which could not be otherwise attained.Now the Spirit does this by the same method as  in the OriginalCreation, namely by creating em nihilo; for otherwise it would bebound by the limitations necessarily inherent in the cosmic formof things, and so no fresh creative starting point would havebeen attained. This is why the Bible lays such stress on theprinciple of Monogenesis, or creation from a single power insteadof from a pair or syzegy; and it is on this account that we aretold that this One-ness of God is the foundation of all thecommandments, and that the "Son of God" is declared to be"monogenes" or one-begotten, for that is the correct translationof the Greek word. The immense importance of this principle ofcreation from a single power will become apparent as we realizemore fully the results proceeding from the assumption of theopposite principle, or the dualism of the creative power; but asthe discussion of this great subject would require a volume toitself, I must, at present, content myself with saying that thisinsistence of the Bible upon the singleness of the Creative Poweris based upon a knowledge which goes to the very root of esotericprinciples, and is therefore not to be set aside in favour ofdualistic systems, though superficially the latter may appearmore consonant to reason.If, then, it is possible to put the Great Affirmation into wordsit is that God is ONE and that this ONE finds centre inourselves; and if the full meaning of this statement is realized,the logical result will be found to be a new creation both in andfrom ourselves. We shall realize in ourselves the working of anew principle whose distinguishing feature is its simplicity. Itis ONE-ness and is not troubled about any second. Hence what itcontemplates is not how its action will be modified by that ofsome second principle, something which will compel it to work ina particular manner and so limit it; but what it contemplates isits own Unity. Then it perceives that its Unity consists in agreater and a lesser movement, just as the rotation of the earthon its axis does not interfere with its rotation round the sunbut are both motions of the same unit, and are definitely relatedto each other. In like manner we find that the Spirit is movingsimultaneously in the macrocosm of the universe and in themicrocosm of the individual, and the two movements harmonizebecause they are that of the same Spirit, and the latter isincluded in the former and pre-supposes it. The GreatAffirmation, therefore, is the perception that the "I AM" is ONE,always harmonious with itself, and including all things in thisharmony for the simple reason that there is no second creativepower; and when the individual realizes that this always-singlepower is the root of his own being, and therefore has centre inhimself and finds expression through him, he learns to trust itssingleness and the consequent harmony of its action in him withwhat it is doing AROUND him. Then he sees that the affirmation "Iand my Father are ONE" is a necessary deduction from a correctapprehension of the fundamental principles of being; and then, onthe principle that the less must be included in the greater, hedesires that harmonious unity of action be maintained by theadaptation of his own particular movement to the larger movementof the Spirit working as the Creative Principle through the greatwhole. In this way we become centres through which the creative forces find specialization by the development of that personalfactor on which the specific application  of general laws mustalways depend. A specific sort of  individuality is formed,capable of being the link between  the great Spiritual Power ofthe universal and the manifestation of the relative in time andspace because it consciously partakes of both; and because theindividual of this class recognizes the singleness of the Spiritas the starting  point of all things, he endeavours to withdrawhis mind from all arguments derived from external conditions,whether past or present, and to fix it upon the forward movementof the Spirit which he knows to be always identical both in theuniverse and in himself. He ceases the attempt to dictate to theSpirit, because he does not see in it a mere blind force, butreveres it as the Supreme Intelligence: and on the other hand hedoes not grovel before it in doubt and fear, because he knows itis one with himself and is realizing itself through him, andtherefore cannot have any purpose antagonistic to his ownindividual welfare. Realizing this he deliberately places histhoughts under the guidance of the Divine Spirit, knowing thathis outward acts and conditions must thereby be brought intoharmony with the great forward movement of the Spirit, not onlyat the stage he has now reached, but at all future stages. Hedoes not at all deny the power of his own thought as the creativeagent in his own personal world,--on the contrary it is preciselyon the knowledge of this fact that his perception of the trueadjustment between the principles of Life is based; but for thisvery reason he is the more solicitous to be led by that Wisdomwhich can see what he cannot see, so that his personal controlover the conditions of his own life may be employed to itscontinual increase and development.In this way our affirmation of the "I am" ceases to be thepetulant assertion of our limited personality and becomes theaffirmation that the Great I AM affirms its own I AM-ness both inus and through us, and thus our use of the words becomes in verytruth the Great Affirmative, or that which is the root of allbeing as distinguished from that which has no being in itself butis merely externalized by being as the vehicle for itsexpression. We shall realize our true place as subordinatecreative centres, perfectly independent of existing conditionsbecause the creative process is that of monogenesis and requiresno other factor than the Spirit for its exercise, but at the sametime subordinate to the Divine Spirit in the greatness of itsinherent forward movement because there is only ONE Spirit and itcannot from one centre antagonize what it is doing from another.Thus the Great Affirmation makes us children of the Great King,at once living in obedience to that Power which is above us, andexercising this same power over all that world of secondarycausation which is below us.Thus in our measure and station each one of us will receive themission of the I AM.CHRIST THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW."Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the proph.ets: Iam not come to destroy but to fulfil." (Matt. v. 17.)"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone thatbelieveth." (Rom. x. 4.)If these words are the utterance of a mere sectarian superstitionthey are worthless; but if they are the statement of a greatprinciple, then it is worth our while to enquire what thatprinciple is. The fulfilling of anything is the bringing intocomplete realization of all that it potentially contains, and sothe filling of any law to its fulness means bringing out all thepossibilities which are hidden in it. This is precisely themethod which has brought forth all the advances of materialcivilization. The laws of nature are the same now that they werein the days of our rugged Anglo-Saxon ancestors, but they broughtout only an infinitesimal fraction of the possibilities whichthose laws contain: now we have brought out a good deal more, butwe have by no means exhausted them, and so we continue toadvance, not by contradicting natural laws, but by more fullyrealizing their capacity. Why should we not, then, apply the samemethod to ourselves and see whether there are no potentialitieshidden away in the law of our own being which we have not as yetby any means brought to their fulfilment? We talk of a good timecoming and of the ameliorating of the race; but do we reflectthat the race is composed of individuals and that therefore realadvance is to be made only by individual improvement, and not byAct of Parliament? and if so, then the individual with whom tobegin is ourself.The complete manifestation of the Law of Individuality is the endor purpose of the Bible teaching concerning Christ. It is ateaching based upon Law, spiritual and mental, fully recognizingthat no effect can be produced except by the operation of anadequate cause, and Christ is set before us both as explainingthe causes and exhibiting the full measure of the effects. Allthis is according to Law; and the importance of its beingaccording to Law is that Law is universal, and the potentialitiesof the Law are therefore inherent in everyone there is no speciallaw for anybody, but anybody can specialize the law by using itwith a fuller understanding of how much can be got out of it; andthe purpose of the Scripture teaching regarding Christ is to helpus to do this.The preceding lectures have led us step by step to see that theOriginating Spirit, which first brought the world into existence,is also the root of our own individuality, and is thereforealways ready, by its inherent nature, to continue the creativeprocess from this individual stand-point as soon as the necessaryconditions are provided, and these conditions arethought-conditions. Then by realizing the relation of Christ tothe Originating Mind, the Parent Spirit or "Father," we receive aSTANDARD of thought which is bound to act creatively bringing outall the potentialities of our hidden being. Now the relation ofChrist to the "Father" is that of the Architypal Idea in theAll-creating Mind of which I have previously spoken, and so wearrive at the conception of the Christ-idea as a universalprinciple, and as being an idea therefore capable of reproductionin the individual Mind, thus explaining St. Paul's meaning whenhe speaks of Christ being formed in us. It is here that theprinciple of monogenesis comes in, that principle which I haveendeavoured to describe in the earlier part of the present seriesas originating the whole manifested creation by an internalaction of the Spirit upon itself; and it is the entire absence ofcontrol by any second power that renders the realization inexternal actuality of a purely mental ideal possible. For thisreason systematic spiritual study commences with thecontemplation of the existing cosmos, and we then transfer theconception of the monogenetic power of the Spirit from the cosmosto the individual and realize that the same Spirit is able to dothe same thing in ourselves. This is the New Thought which intime will fulfil itself in the New Order, and we thus provide newthought-conditions which enable the Spirit to carry on itscreative work from a new stand-point, that of our ownindividuality. This attainment by the Spirit of a newstarting-point is what is meant by the esoteric doctrine of theOctave. The Octave is the starting-point of a new seriesreduplicating the starting-point of the previous series at adifferent level, just as does the octave note in music. We findthis principle constantly referred to in Scripture--thecompletion of a prior series in the number Seven, and thestarting of a new series by the number Eight, which takes thesame place in the second series that the number One did in thefirst. The second series comes out of the first by natural growthand could not come into existence without it, hence the First orOriginating number of the second series is the Eighth if weregard the second series as the prolongation of the first. Sevenis the numerical correspondence of complete manifestation becauseit is the combination of three and four, which respectivelyrepresent the complete working of the spiritual and materialfactors--involution and evolution--and thus together constitutethe finished whole. Students of the Tarot will here realize theprocess by which the Yod of Yod becomes the Yod of He. It is forthis reason that the primary or cosmic creation terminates in therest of the Seventh Day, for it can proceed no further until afresh starting-point is found; But when this fresh starting-pointis found in Man realizing his relation to the "Father," we starta new series and strike the Creative Octave and therefore theResurrection takes place, not on the Sabbath or Seventh Day, buton the Eighth day which then becomes the First day of the newcreak five week. The principle of the Resurrection is therealization by man of his individualization of the Spirit and hisrecognition of the fact that, since the Spirit is always the sameSpirit, it becomes the Alpha of a new creation from his owncentre of being.Now all this is necessarily an interior process taking place onthe mental plane; but if we realize that the creative process isalways primarily one of involution, or formation in the spiritualworld, we shall grasp something of the meaning of Christ as "TheSon of God"--the concentration of the Universal Spirit into aPersonality on the spiritual plane correlatively to theindividuality of each one who affords the necessarythought-conditions. To all who apprehend it there is thendiscovered in the Universal Spirit the presence of a DivineIndividuality reciprocal to that of the individual man, therecognition of which is the practical solution of allmetaphysical problems regarding the emanation of the individualsoul from the Universal Spirit and the relations arisingtherefrom; for it takes these matters out of the region ofintellectual speculation, which is never creative but onlyanalytical, and transfers it to the region of feeling andspiritual sensation which is the abode of the creative forces.This personal recognition of the Divine then affords us a newbasis of Affirmation, and we need no longer trouble to go furtherback in order to analyze it, because we know experimentally thatit is there; so now we find the starting-point of the newcreation ready-made for us according to the architypal pattern inthe Divine Mind itself and therefore perfectly correctly formed.When once this truth is clearly apprehended, whether we reach itby an intellectual process or by simple intuition, we can make itour starting-point and claim to have our thought permeated by thecreative power of the Spirit on this basis.But vast as is the conception thus reached we must remember thatit is still a starting-point. It, indeed, transcends our previousrange of ideas and so presents a culmination of the cosmiccreative series which passes beyond that series and thus bringsus to number Eight or the Octave; but on this very account it isthe number One of a new creative series which is personal to theindividual.Then, because the Spirit is always the same, we may look for arepetition of the creative process at a higher level, and, as weall know, that process consists first of the involution of Spiritinto Substance, and consequently of the subsequent evolution ofSubstance into forms continually increasing in fitness asvehicles for Spirit: so now we may look for a repetition of thisuniversal process from its new starting-point in the individualmind and expect a corresponding externalization in accordancewith our familiar axiom that thoughts are things.Now it is as such an external manifestation of the Divine idealthat the Christ of the Gospels is set before us. I do not wish todogmatize, but I will only say that the more clearly we realizethe nature of the creative process on the spiritual side the morethe current objections to the Gospel narrative lose their force;and it appears to me that to deny that narrative as a point-blankimpossibility is to make a similar affirmation with regard to thepower of the Spirit in ourselves. You cannot affirm a principleand deny it in the same breath; and if we affirm theexternalizing power of the Spirit in our own case, I do not seehow we can logically lay down a limit for its action and say thatunder highly specialized conditions it could not produce highlyspecialized effects. It is for this reason that St. John puts thequestion of Christ manifest in the flesh as the criterion of thewhole matter (I. John iv., 2). If the Spirit can create at allthen you cannot logically limit the extent or method of itsworking; and since the basis of our expectation of individualexpansion is the limitless creative power of the Spirit, toreject the Christ of the Gospels as an impossibility is to cutaway the ground from under our own feet. It is one thing to say"I do not understand why the Spirit should have worked in thatway"--that is merely an honest statement of our present stage ofknowledge, or we may even go the length of saying that we do notfeel convinced that it did work in that way--that is a trueconfession of our intellectual difficulty--but certainly thosewho are professedly relying on the power of the Spirit to produceexternal results cannot say that it does not possess that power,or possesses it only in a limited degree: the position islogically self-destructive. What we should do therefore, is tosuspend judgment and follow the light as far as we can see it,and bye-and-bye it will become clearer to us. There are, itappears to me, occult heights in the doctrine of Christ designedby the Supreme Wisdom to counteract corresponding occult depthsin the Mystery of Darkness. I do not think it is at allnecessary, or even possible, for us to scale these heights orfathom those depths, with our present infantile intelligence, butif we realize how completely the law of our being receives itsfulfilment in Christ as far as we know that law, may we not wellconceive that there are yet deeper phases of that law theexistence of which we can only faintly surmise by intuition?Occasionally just the fringe of the veil is lifted for some ofus, but that momentary glance is enough to show us that there arepowers and mysteries beyond our present conception. But eventhere Law reigns supreme, and therefore taking Christ as ourbasis and starting-point, we start with the Law alreadyfulfilled, whether in those things which are familiar to us or inthose realms which are beyond our thought, and so we need have ncfear of evil. Our starting-point is that of a divinely ordainedsecurity from which we may quietly grow into that higherevolution which is the fulfilment of the law of our own being.THE STORY OF EDEN.The whole Bible and the whole history of the world, past, presentand future, are contained in embryo in the story of Eden, forthey are nothing else than the continuous unfolding of certaingreat principles which are there allegorically stated. That thisis by no means a new notion is shown by the following quotationfrom Origen:--"Who is there so foolish and without common-senseas to believe that God planted trees in the Garden of Eden like ahusbandman; and planted therein the tree of life perceptible tothe eyes and to the senses, which gave life to the eater; andanother tree which gave to the eater a knowledge of good andevil? I believe that everybody must regard these as figures underwhich a recondite sense is concealed." Let us, then, follow upthe suggestion of this early Father of the Church, and enquirewhat may be the "recondite sense" concealed under this figure ofthe two trees. On the face of the story there are two roots, oneof Life and the other of Death, two fundamental principlesbringing about diametrically opposite results. The distinctivemark of the latter is that it is the knowledge of good and evil,that is to say, the recognition of two antagonistic principles,and so requiring a knowledge of the relations between them toenable us to continually make the needful adjustments to keepourselves going. Now, in appearance this is exceedingly specious.It looks so entirely reasonable that we do not see its ultimatedestructiveness; and so we are told that Eve ate the fruitbecause she "saw that the tree was pleasant to the eyes." Butcareful consideration will show us in what the destructive natureof this principle consists. It is based on the fallacy that goodis limited by evil, and that you cannot receive any good exceptthrough eliminating the corresponding evil by realizing it andbeating it back. In this view life becomes a continual combatagainst every imaginable form of evil, and after we have rackedour brains to devise precautions against all possible evilhappenings, there remains the chance, and much more than thechance, that we have by no means exhausted the category ofnegative possibilities, and that others may arise which no amountof foresight on our part could have imagined. The more we seeinto this position the more intolerable it becomes, because fromthis stand-point we can never attain any certain basis of action,and the forces of possible evil multiply as we contemplate them.To set forth to out-wit all evil by our own knowledge of itsnature is to attempt a task the hopelessness of which becomesapparent when we see it in its true light.The mistake is in supposing that Life can be generated inourselves by an intellectual process; but, as we have seen in thepreceding lectures, Life is the primary movement of the Spirit,whether in the cosmos or in the individual. In its proper orderintellectual knowledge is exceedingly important and useful, butits place in the order of the whole is not that of theOriginator. It is not Life in itself, but is a function of life;it is an effect and not the cause. The reason why this is so isbecause intellectual study is always the study of the variouslaws which arise from the different RELATIONS of things to oneanother; and it therefore presupposes that these things togetherwith their laws are already in existence. Consequently it doesnot start from the truly creative stand-point, that of creatingsomething entirely new, creation ex nihilo as distinguished fromCONSTRUCTION, or the laying-together of existing materials, whichis what the word literally means. To recognize evil as a force tobe reckoned with is therefore to give up the creative stand-pointaltogether. It is to quit the plane of First Cause and descendinto the realm of secondary causation and lose ourselves amid theconfusion of a multiplicity of relative causes and effectswithout grasping any unifying principle behind them.Now the only thing that can release us from the inextricableconfusion of an infinite multiplicity is the realization of anunderlying unity, and at the back of all things we find thepresence of one Great Affirmative principle without which nothingcould have existence. This, then, is the Root of Life; and if wecredit it with being able, not only to supply the power, but alsothe form for its manifestation we shall see that we need not gobeyond this SINGLE Power for the production of anything. It isSpirit producing Substance out of its own essence, and theSubstance taking Form in accordance with the movement of theSpirit. What we have to realize is, not only that this is the wayin which the cosmos is brought into existence, but also that,because the Spirit finds a new centre in ourselves, the sameprocess is repeated in our own mentality, and therefore we arecontinually creating ex nihilo whether we know it or not.Consequently, if we look upon evil as a force to be reckonedwith, and therefore requiring to be studied, we are in effectcreating it; while on the other hand if we realize that there isonly ONE force to be considered, and that absolutely good, we areby the law of the creative process bringing that good intomanifestation. No doubt for this affirmative use of our creativepower it is necessary that we start from the basic conception ofa SINGLE originating power which is absolutely good andlife-giving; but if there were a self-originating power which wasdestructive then no creation could ever have come into existenceat all, for the positive and negative self-originating powerswould cancel each other and the result would be zero. The fact,therefore, of our own existence is a sufficient proof of thesingleness and goodness of the Originating Power, and from thisstarting-point there is no second power to be taken intoconsideration, and consequently we do not have to study the evilthat may arise out of existing or future circumstances, butrequire to keep our minds fixed only upon the good which weintend to create. There is a very simple reason for this. It isthat every new creation necessarily carries its own law with itand by that law produces new conditions of its own. A balloonaffords a familiar illustration of my meaning. The balloon withits freight weighs several hundredweight, yet the introduction ofa new factor, the gas, brings with it a law of its own whichentirely alters the conditions, and the force of gravity is socompletely overcome that the whole mass rises into the air. TheLaw itself is never altered, but we have previously known it onlyunder limiting conditions. These conditions, however, are no partof the Law itself; and a clearer realization of the Law shows usthat it contains in itself the power of transcending them. Thelaw which every new creation carries with it is therefore not acontradiction of the old law but its specialization into a highermode of action.Now the ultimate Law is that of production ex nihilo by themovement of the Spirit within itself, and all subordinate lawsare merely the measurements of the relations which spontaneouslyarise between different things when they are brought intomanifestation, arid therefore, if an entirely new thing iscreated it must necessarily establish entirely new relations andso produce entirely new laws. This is the reason why, if we takethe action of pure unmanifested Spirit as our starting-point, wemay confidently trust it to produce manifestations of law which,though perfectly new from the stand-point of our past experience,are quite as natural in their own way as any that have gonebefore. It is on this account that in these addresses I lay somuch stress on the fact that Spirit creates ex nihilo, that is,out of no pre-existing forms, but simply by its own movementwithin itself. If, then, this idea is clearly grasped, itlogically follows from it that the Root of Life is not to befound in the comparison of good and evil, but in the simpleaffirmation of the Spirit as the All-creating power of Good. Andsince, as we have already seen, this same all-creating Spiritfinds a centre and fresh starting-point of operation in our ownminds, we can trust it to follow the Law of its own being thereas much as in the creation of the cosmos.Only we must not forget that it is working through our own minds.It thinks through our mind, and our mind must be made a suitablechannel for this mode of its operation by conforming itself tothe broad generic lines of the Spirit's thinking. The reason forthis is one which I have sought to impress throughout theselectures, namely, that the specialization of a law is never thedenial of it, but on the contrary the fuller recognition of itsbasic principles; and if this is the case in ordinary physicalscience it must be equally so when we come to specialize thegreat Law of Life itself. The Spirit can never change itsessential nature as the essence of Life, Love, and Beauty; and ifwe adopt these characteristics, which constitute the Law of theSpirit, as the basis of our own thinking, and reject all that iscontrary to them, then we afford the broad generic conditions forthe specialized thinking of the Spirit through our own minds: andthe thinking of the Spirit is that INVOLUTION, or passing ofspirit into form, which is the whole being of the creativeprocess.The mind which is all the time being thus formed is our own. Itis not a case of control by an external individuality, but thefuller expression of the Universal through an organized mentalitywhich has all along been a less perfect expression of theUniversal; and therefore the process is one of growth. We are notlosing our individuality, but are coming into fuller possessionof ourselves by the conscious recognition of our personal sharein the great work of creation. We begin in some slight measure tounderstand what the Bible means when it speaks of our-being"partakers of the Divine nature" (II. Peter i. 4) and we realizethe significance of the "unity of the Spirit" (Ephesians iv. 3).Doubtless this will imply changes in our old mode of thinking;but these changes are not forced upon us, they are brought aboutnaturally by the new stand-point from which we now see things.Almost imperceptibly to ourselves we grow into a New Order ofThought which proceeds, not from a knowledge of good and evil,but from the Principle of Life itself. That is what makes thedifference between our old thought and our new thought. Our oldthought was based upon a comparison of limited facts: our newthought is based upon a comprehension of principles. Thedifference is like that between the mathematics of the infant,who cannot count beyond the number of apples or marbles putbefore him, and that of the senior wrangler who is not dependentupon visible objects for his calculations, but plunges boldlyinto the unknown because he knows that he is working byindubitable principles. In like manner when we realize theinfallible Principle of the Creative Law we no longer find weneed to see everything cut and dried beforehand, for if so, wecould never get beyond the range of our old experiences; but wecan move steadily forward because we know the certainty of thecreative principle by which we are working, or rather, which isworking through us, and that our life, in all its minutes"details, is its harmonious expression. Thus the Spirit thinksthrough our thought only its thought is greater than ours. It isthe paradox of the less containing the greater. Our thought willnot be objectless or unintelligible to ourselves. It will bequite clear as far as it goes. We shall know exactly what we wantto do and why we want to do it, and so will act in a reasonableand intelligent manner. But what we do not know is the greaterthought that is all the time giving rise to our smaller thought,and which will open out from it as our lesser thought progressesinto form. Then we gradually see the greater thought whichprompted our smaller one and we find ourselves working along itslines, guided by the invisible hand of the Creative Spirit intocontinually increasing degrees of livingness to which we needassign no limits, for it is the expansion of the Infinite withinourselves.This, as it appears to me, is the hidden meaning of the two treesin Eden, the Garden of the Soul. It is the distinction between aknowledge which is merely that of comparisons between differentsorts of conditions, and a knowledge which is that of the Lifewhich gives rise to and therefore controls conditions. Only wemust remember that the control of conditions is not to beattained by violent self-assertion which is only recognizing themas substantive entities to be battled with, but by consciousunity with that All-creating Spirit which works silently, butsurely, on its own lines of Life, Love, and Beauty."Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord ofHosts."THE WORSHIP OF ISHI.In Hosea ii. 16 we find this remarkable statement:--"And it shallbe at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call Me Ishi, andshalt no more call Me Baali"; and with this we may couple thestatement in Isaiah lxii. 4:--"Thou shalt be called Hephzibah,and thy land Beulah; for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thyland shall be married."In both these passages we find a change of name; and since a namestands for something which corresponds to it, and in truth onlyamounts to a succinct description, the fact indicated in thesetexts is a change of condition answering to the change of name.Now the change from Baali to Ishi indicates an importantalteration in the relation between the Divine Being and theworshipper; but since the Divine Being cannot change, the alteredrelation must result from a change in the stand-point of theworshipper: and this can only come from a new mode of looking atthe Divine, that is, from a new order of thought regarding it.Baali means Lord, and Ishi means husband, and so the change inrelation is that of a female slave who is liberated and marriedto her former master. We could not have a more perfect analogy.Relatively to the Universal Spirit the individual soul isesoterically feminine, as I have pointed out in "Bible Mysteryand Bible Meaning," because its function is that of the receptiveand formative. This is necessarily inherent in the nature of thecreative process. But the individual's development as thespecializing medium of the Universal Spirit will depend entirelyupon his own conception of his relation to it. So long as he onlyregards it as an arbitrary power, a sort of slave owner, he willfind himself in the position of a slave driven by an inscrutableforce, he knows not whither or for what purpose. He may worshipsuch a God, but his worship is only the worship of fear andignorance, and there is no personal interest in the matter exceptto escape some dreaded punishment. Such a worshipper would gladlyescape from his divinity, and his worship, when analyzed, will befound to be little else than disguised hatred. This is thenatural result of a worship based upon UNEXPLAINED traditionsinstead of intelligible principles, and is the very opposite ofthat worship in Spirit and in truth which Jesus speaks of as thetrue worship.But when the light begins to break in upon us, all this becomeschanged. We see that a system of terrorism cannot give expressionto the Divine Spirit, and we realize the truth of St. Paul'swords, "He hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power,and of love, and of a sound mind." As the true nature of therelation between the individual mind and the Universal Mindbecomes clearer, we find it to be one of mutual action andre-action, a perfect reciprocity which cannot be bettersymbolized than by the relation between an affectionate husbandand wife. Everything is done from love and nothing fromcompulsion, there is perfect confidence on both sides, and bothare equally indispensable to each other. It is simply thecarrying out of the fundamental maxim that the Universal cannotact on the plane of the Particular except through the Particular;only this philosophical axiom develops into a warm livingintercourse.Now this is the position of the soul which is indicated by thename Hephzibah. In common with all other words derived from theSemitic root "hafz" it implies the idea of guarding, just as inthe East a hasfiz is one who guards the letter of the Koran byhaving the whole book by heart, and in many similar expressions.Hephzibah may therefore be translated as "a guarded one," thusrecalling the New Testament description of those who are "guardedinto salvation." It is precisely this conception of being guardedby a superior power that distinguishes the worship of Ishi fromthat of Baali. A special relation has been established betweenthe Divine Spirit and the individual soul, one of absoluteconfidence and personal intercourse. This does not require anydeparture from the general law of the universe, but is due tothat specializing of the law through the presentation of specialconditions personal to the individual, of which I have spokenbefore. But all the time there has been no change in theUniversal Spirit, the only change has been in the mental attitudeof the individual--he has come into a new thought, a clearerperception of God. He has faced the questions, What is God? Whereis God? How does God work? and he has found the answer in theapostolic statement that God is "over all, through all, and inall," and he realises that "God" is the root of his (theindividual's) own being, ever present IN him, ever workingTHROUGH him, and universally present around him.This realization of the true relation between the OriginatingSpirit and the individual mind is what is esoterically spoken ofas the Mystical Marriage in which the two have ceased to beseparate and have become one. As a matter of fact they alwayswere one, but since we can apprehend things only from thestand-point of our own consciousness, it is our recognition ofthe fact that makes it a practical reality for ourselves. But anintelligent recognition will never make a confusion of the twoparts of which the whole consists, and will never lead theindividual to suppose that he is handling a blind force or that ablind force is handling him. He will neither dethrone God, norlose himself by absorption in deity, but he will recognize thereciprocity of the Divine and the human as the natural andlogical outcome of the essential conditions of the creativeprocess.And what is the Whole which is thus created? It is our consciousPERSONALITY; and therefore whatever we draw from the UniversalSpirit acquires in us the quality of personality. It is thatprocess of differentiation of the universal into the particularof which I have so often spoken, which, by a rude analogy, we maycompare to the differentiation of the universal electric fluidinto specific sorts of power by its passage through suitableapparatus. It is for this reason that relatively to ourselves theUniversal Spirit must necessarily assume a personal aspect, andthat the aspect which it will assume will be in exactcorrespondence with our own conception of it. This is inaccordance with mental and spiritual laws inherent in our ownbeing, and it is on this account that the Bible seeks to build upour conception of God on such lines as will set us free from allfear of evil, and thus leave us at liberty to use the creativepower of our thought affirmatively from the stand-point of a calmand untroubled mind. This stand-point can only be reached bypassing beyond the range of the happenings of the moment, andthis can only be done by the discovery of our immediate relationto the undifferentiated source of all good. I lay stress on thesewords "immediate" and "undifferentiated" because in them iscontained the secret of the whole position. If we could not drawimmediately from the Universal Spirit our receiving would besubject to the limitations of the channel through which itreached us; and if the force which we receive were notundifferentiated in itself it could not take appropriate form inour own minds and become to each of us just what we require it tobe. It is this power of the human soul to differentiatelimitlessly from the Infinite that we are apt to overlook, but aswe come to realize that the soul is itself a reflection and imageof the Infinite Spirit--and a clear recognition of the cosmiccreative process shows that it cannot be anything else--we findthat it must possess this power, and that-in fact it is ourpossession of this power which is the whole raison d'etre of thecreative process: if the human soul did not possess an unlimitedpower of differentiation from the Infinite, then the Infinitewould not be reflected in it, and consequently the InfiniteSpirit would find no outlet for its CONSCIOUS recognition ofitself as the Life, Love, and Beauty which it is. We can nevertoo deeply ponder the old esoteric definition of Spirit as "thePower which knows itself": the secret of all things, past,present, and future is contained in these few words. The self-recognition or self-contemplation of Spirit is the primarymovement out of which all creation proceeds, and the attainmentin the individual of a fresh centre for self-recognition is whatthe Spirit GAINS in the process--this GAIN accruing to the Spiritis what is referred to in the parables where the lord isrepresented as receiving increase from his servants.When the individual perceives this relation between himself andInfinite Spirit, he finds that he has been raised from a positionof slavery to one of reciprocity. The Spirit cannot do withouthim any more than he can do without the Spirit: the two are asnecessary to each other as the two poles of an electric battery.The Spirit is the unlimited essence of Love, Wisdom, and Power,all three in one undifferentiated and waiting to bedifferentiated by APPROPRIATION, that is, by the individualCLAIMING to be the channel of their differentiation. It onlyrequires the claim to be made with the recognition that by theLaw of Being it is bound to be answered, and the right feeling,the right seeing, and the right working for the particular matterwe have in hand will flow in quite naturally. Our old enemies,doubt and fear, may seek to bring us back under bondage to Baali,but our new stand-point for the recognition of theAll-originating Spirit as being absolutely unified with ourselvesmust always be kept resolutely in mind; for, short of this, weare not working on the creative level--we are creating, indeed,for we can never divest ourselves of our creative power, but weare creating in the image of the old limiting and destructiveconditions, and this is merely perpetuating the cosmic Law ofAverages, which is just what the individual has to rise superiorto. The creative level is where new laws begin to manifestthemselves in a new order of conditions, something transcendingour past experiences and thus bringing about a real advance; forit is no advance only to go on in the same old round even if wekept at it for centuries: it is the steady go-ahead nature of theSpirit that has made the world of to-day an improvement upon theworld of the pterodactyl and the icthiosaurus, and we must lookfor the same forward movement of the Spirit from its newstarting-point in ourselves.Now it is this special, personal, and individual relation of theSpirit to ourselves which is typified by the names Ishi andHephzibah. From this stand-point we may say that as theindividual wakes up to the oneness with the Spirit, the Spiritwakes up to the same thing. It becomes conscious of itselfthrough the consciousness of the individual, and thus is solvedthe paradox of individual self-recognition by the UniversalSpirit, without which no new-creative power could be exercisedand all things would continue to proceed in the old merely cosmicorder. It is of course true that in the merely generic order theSpirit must be present in every form of Life, as the Masterpointed out when He said that not a sparrow falls to the groundwithout "the Father." But as the sparrows He alluded to had beenshot and were on sale at a price which shows that this was thefate of a good many of them, we see here precisely that stage ofmanifestation where the Spirit has not woke up to individualself-recognition, and remains at the lower level ofself-recognition, that of the generic or race-spirit. TheMaster's comment, "Ye are of more value than many sparrows"points out this difference: in us the generic creation hasreached the level which affords the conditions for the waking upof the Spirit to self-recognition in the Individual.And we must bear in mind that all this is perfectly natural.There is no posing or straining after effect about it. If YOUhave to pump up the Life, who is going to put the Life into youto pump it? Therefore it is spontaneous or nothing. That is whythe Bible speaks of it as the free gift of God. It cannot beanything else. You cannot originate the originating force; itmust originate you: but what you can do is to distribute it.Therefore immediately you experience any sense of friction besure there is something wrong somewhere; and since God can neverchange, you may be sure that the friction is being caused by someerror in your own thinking--you are limiting the Spirit in someway: set to work to find out what it is. It is always LIMITINGthe Spirit that does this. You are tying it down to conditionssomewhere, saying it is bound by reason of some existing forms.The remedy is to go back to the original starting point of theCosmic Creation and ask, Where were the pre-existing forms thatdictated to the Spirit then? Then because the Spirit neverchanges it is STILL THE SAME, and is just as independent ofexisting conditions now as it was in the beginning; and so wemust pass over all existing conditions, however apparentlyadverse, and go straight to the Spirit as the originator of newforms and new conditions. This is real New Thought, for it doesnot trouble about the old things, but is going straight aheadfrom where we are now. When we do this, just trusting the Spirit,and not laying down the particular details of its action--justtelling it what we want without dictating HOW we are to get it--we shall find that things will open out more and more clearly dayby day both on the inner and the outer plane. Remember that theSpirit is alive and working here and now, for if ever the Spiritis to get from the past into the future it must be by passingthrough the present; therefore what you have to do is to acquirethe habit of living direct -from the Spirit here and now. Youwill soon find that this is a matter of personal intercourse,perfectly natural and not requiring any abnormal conditions forits production. You just treat the Spirit as you would any otherkind-hearted sensible person, remembering that it is alwaysthere--"closer than hands and feet," as Tennyson says--and youwill gradually begin to appreciate its reciprocity as a verypractical fact indeed.This is the relation of Hephzibah to Ishi, and is that worship inSpirit and in truth which needs neither the temple in Jerusalemnor yet in Samaria for its acceptance, for the whole world is thetemple of the Spirit and you yourself its sanctuary. Bear this inmind, and remember that nothing is too great or too small, toointerior or too external, for the Spirit's recognition andoperation, for the Spirit is itself both the Life and theSubstance of all things and it is also Self-recognition from thestand-point of your own individuality; and therefore, because theSelf-recognition of Spirit is the Life of the creative process,you will, by simply trusting the Spirit to work according to itsown nature, pass more and more completely into that New Orderwhich proceeds from the thought of Him who says, "Behold I makeall things new."THE SHEPHERD AND THE STONE.The metaphor of the Shepherd and the Sheep is of constantoccurrence throughout the Bible and naturally suggests the ideaof the guiding, guarding, and feeding both of the individualsheep and of the whole flock and it is not difficult to see thespiritual correspondence of these things in a general sort ofway. But we find that the Bible combines the metaphor of theShepherd with another metaphor that of "the Stone," and at firstsight the two seem rather incongruous."From thence is the Shepherd the Stone of Israel," says the OldTestament (Genesis xlix. 24), and Jesus calls himself both "TheGood Shepherd" and "The Stone which the builders rejected." TheShepherd and the Stone are thus identified and we must thereforeseek the interpretation in some conception which combines thetwo. A shepherd suggests Personal care for the welfare of thesheep, and an intelligence greater than theirs. A stone suggeststhe idea of Building, and consequently of measurement, adaptationof parts to whole, and progressive construction according toplan. Combining these two conceptions we get the idea of thebuilding of an edifice whose stones are persons, each takingtheir more or less conscious part in the construction--thus abuilding, not constructed from without, but self-forming by aprinciple of growth from within under the guidance of a SupremeWisdom permeating the whole and conducting it stage by stage toultimate completeness. This points to a Divine Order in humanaffairs with which we may more or less consciously co-operate:both to our personal advantage and also to the furtherance of thegreat scheme of human evolution as a whole; the ultimate purposebeing to establish in ALL men that principle of "The Octave" towhich I have already alluded; and in proportion as someadumbration of this principle is realized by individuals and bygroups of individuals they specialize the law ofrace-development, even though they may not be aware of the fact,and so come under a SPECIALIZED working of the fundamental Law,which thus differentiates them from other individuals andnationalities, as by a peculiar guidance, producing higherdevelopments which the merely generic operation of the Law couldnot.Now if we keep steadily in mind that, though the purpose, or Lawof Tendency, or the Originating Spirit must always be universalin its nature, it must necessarily be individual in itsoperation, we shall see that this universal purpose can only beaccomplished through the instrumentality of specific means. Thisresults from the fundamental proposition that the Universal canonly work on the plane of the Particular by becoming theindividual and particular; and when we grasp the conception thatthe merely generic operation of the Creative Law has now broughtthe human race as far as it can, that is to say it has completelyevolved the merely natural GENUS home, it follows that if anyfurther development is to take place it can only be by theco-operation of the individual himself. Now it is the spread ofthis individual co-operation that the forward movement of theSpirit is leading us to, and it is the gradual extension of thisuniversal principle that is alluded to in the prophecy of Danielregarding the Stone cut out without hands that spreads until itfills the whole earth (Daniel ii. 34 and 44). According to theinterpretation given by Daniel, this Stone is the emblem of aspiritual Kingdom, and the identity of the Stone and the Shepherdindicates that the Kingdom of the Stone must be also the Kingdomof the Shepherd; and the Master, who identified himself with boththe Stone and the Shepherd, emphatically declared that thisKingdom was, in its essence, an interior Kingdom--"the Kingdom ofHeaven is within you." We must look for its foundation therefore,in a spiritual principle or mental law inherent in theconstitution of all men but waiting to be brought into fullerdevelopment by more accurate compliance with its essentialrequirements; which is precisely the method by which science hasevoked powers from the laws of nature which were undreamt of informer ages; and in like manner the recognition of our truerelation to the Universal Spirit, which is the source of allindividual being, must lead to an advance both for the race andfor the individual such as we can at present scarcely form thefaintest idea of, but which we dimly apprehend through theintuition and speak of as the New Order. The approach of this NewOrder is everywhere making itself vaguely felt; it is, as theFrench say, in the air, and the very vagueness and mysteryattending it is causing a feeling of unrest as to what form itmay assume. But to the student of Spiritual Law this should notbe the case. He knows that the Form is always the expression ofthe Spirit, and therefore, since he is in touch with the forwardmovement of the Spirit, he knows that he himself will always beharmoniously included in any form of development which the GreatForward Movement may take. This is the practical and personalbenefit arising from the realization of the Principle which issymbolized under the two-fold metaphor of the Shepherd and theStone. and in all those new developments which are perhaps evennow within measurable distance, we can rest on the knowledge thatwe are under the care of a kind Shepherd, and under the formationof a wise Master Builder.But the principle of the Shepherd and the Stone is not somethinghitherto unheard of which is only to conne into existence in thefuture. If there were no manifestations of this principle in thepast, we might question whether there were any such principle atall; but a careful study of the subject will show us that it hasbeen at work all through the ages, sometimes in modes moreimmediately bearing the aspect of the Shepherd, and sometimes inmodes more immediately bearing the aspect of the Stone, thoughthe one always implies the other, for they are the same thingseen from different points of view. The subject is one of immenseinterest, but covering such a wide range of study that all I cando here is to point out that such a field of investigation existsand is worth exploration; and the exploration brings its rewardwith it, not only by putting us in possession of the key to thehistory of the past, but by showing us that it is the key to thehistory of the future also, and furthermore by making evident ona large scale the working of the same principle of Spiritual Lawby cooperation with which we may facilitate the process of ourown individual evolution. It thus adds a vivid interest to life,giving us something worth looking forward to and introducing usto a personal future which is not limited by the proverbialthree-score years and ten.Now, we have seen that the first stage in the Creative Process isalways that of Feeling--a reaching-out by the Spirit in aparticular direction, and therefore we may look for something ofthe same kind in the development of the great principle which weare now considering. And we find this first vague movement ofthis great principle in the intuitions of a particular race whichappears from time immemorial to have combined the twocharacteristics of nomad wandering with their flocks and herdsand the symbolization of their religious beliefs in monuments ofstone. The monuments themselves have taken different forms indifferent countries and ages, but the identity of their symbolismbecomes clear under careful investigation. Together with thissymbolism we always find the nomad character of the builders andthat they are invested with an aura of mystery and romance suchas we find nowhere else, though we always find it surroundingthese builders, even in countries so far apart as India andIreland. Then, as we pass beyond the merely monumental stage, wefind threads of historical evidence connecting the differentbranches of this race, increasing in their complexity andstrengthening in their cumulative force as we go on, until atlast we are brought to the history of the age in which we live;and finally most remarkable affinities of language put thefinishing touch to the mass of proofs which can be gathered alongall these different lines. In this magic circle countries soremote from one another as Ireland and Greece, Egypt and India,Palestine and Persia, are brought into close contiguity--asimilar tradition, and even a similar nomenclature, unite themysterious builders of the Great Pyramid with the equallymysterious builders of the Round Towers of Ireland--and the GreatPyramid itself, perhaps antedating the call of Abraham,re-appears as the official seal of the United States; whiletradition traces the crowning-stone in Westminster Abbey back tothe time of Solomon's temple and even earlier. For the most partthe erewhile wanderers are now settled in their destined homes,but the Anglo-Saxon race--the People of the Corner-Stone--arestill the pioneers among the nations, and there is somethingesoteric in the old joke that when the North Pole is reached aScotchman will be found there. And not least in the chain ofevidence is the link afforded by a tribe who are wanderers still,the Gipsies with their duplicate of the Pyramid in the pack ofcards--a volume which has been called "The Devil's Picture Book"by those who know it only in its misuse and inversion, but whichwhen interpreted in the light of the knowledge we are nowgaining, affords a signal instance of that divine policy by whichas St. Paul says, God employs the foolish things of this world toconfute the wise; while a truer apprehension of the Gipsiesthemselves indicates their unmistakable connection with that racewho through all its wanderings has ever been the guardian of theStone.In these few paragraphs I have only been able to point out verybriefly the broad lines of enquiry into a subject of nationalimportance to the British and American peoples, and whichinterests us personally, not only as members of these nations,but as affording proof on the largest scale of the samespecialization of universal laws which each of us has to effectindividually for ourself. But whether the process be individualor national it is always the same, and is the translation to thevery highest plane--that of the All-originating Life itself--ofthe old maxim that "Nature will obey us exactly in proportion aswe first obey Nature"; it is the old parable of the lord who,finding his servants girt and awaiting him, then girds himselfand serves them (Luke xii. 35 to 37). The nation or theindividual who thus realizes the true principle of the Shepherdand the Stone, comes under a special Divine guidance andprotection, not by a favouritism incompatible with the conceptionof universal Law, but by the very operation of the Law itself.They have come into touch with its higher possibilities, and torecur to an analogy which I have already employed, they learn tomake their iron float by the very same law by which it sinks; andso they become the flock of the Great Shepherd and the buildingof the Great Architect, and each one, however insignificant hisor her sphere may appear, becomes a sharer in the great work, andby a logical consequence begins to grow on new lines ofdevelopment for the simple reason that a new principlenecessarily produces new modes of manifestation. If the readerwill think over these things he will see that the promisescontained in the Bible whether national or personal, are nothingelse than statements of the universal law of Cause and Effectapplied to the inmost principles of our being, and that thereforeit is not mere rhapsody, but the figurative expression of a greattruth when the Psalmist says `"The Lord is my Shepherd," and"Thou art my God and the Rock of my salvation."SALVATION IS OF THE JEWS.What does this saying of the Master's mean? Certainly not a merearrogant assumption in favour of His own nationality--such anidea is negatived, not only by the universality of all His otherteaching, but also by the very instruction in which these wordsoccur, for He declared that the Jewish temple was equally withthe Samaritan of no account in the matter. He said that the trueworship was purely spiritual and entirely independent of placesand ceremonies, while at the same time He emphasized the Jewishexpectation of a Messiah, so that in this teaching we are met bythe paradox of a universal principle combined with what at firstsight appears like a tribal tradition quite incompatible with anyrecognition of the universal reign of law. How to reconcile theseapparent opposites, therefore, seems to be the problem which Hehere sets before us. Its solution is to be found in thatprinciple which I have endeavoured to elucidate throughout theselectures, the specializing of universal law. Opinions may differas to whether the Bible narrative of the birth of Christ is to betaken literally or symbolically, but as to the spiritualprinciple involved there can, I think, be no difference ofopinion. It is that of the specialization by the individual ofthe generic relation of the soul to the Infinite Spirit fromwhich it proceeds. The relation itself is universal and resultsfrom the very nature of the creative process, but the law of theuniversal relation admits of particular specialization exactly inthe same way as all other natural laws--it is simply applying tothe supreme Law of Life the same method by which we have learntto make iron float, that is to say by a fuller recognition ofwhat the Law is in itself. Whatever other meanings we may applyto the name Messiah, it undoubtedly stands for the absolutelyperfect manifestation in the individual of all the infinitepossibilities of the Principle of Life.Now it was because this grand ideal is the basis on which theHebrew nationality was founded that Jesus made this statement.This foundation had been lamentably misconceived by the Jewishpeople; but nevertheless, however imperfectly, they still held byit, and from them this ideal has spread throughout the Christianworld. Here also it continues to be lamentably misconceived,nevertheless it is still retained, and only needs to berecognized in its true light as a universal principle, instead ofan unintelligible dogma, to become the salvation of the world.Hence, as affording the medium through which this supreme idealhas been preserved and spread, it is true that "Salvation is ofthe Jews."Their fundamental idea was right but their apprehension of it waswrong--that is why the Master at the same time sweeps away thenational worship of the temple and preserves the national idea ofthe Messiah; and this is equally true of the Christian world atthe present day. If salvation is anything real it must have itscause in some law, and if there is a law it must be founded uponsome universal principle: therefore it is this principle which wemust seek if we would understand this teaching of the Master's.Now whether we take the Bible story of the birth of Christliterally or symbolically, it teaches one great lesson. Itteaches that the All-originating Spirit is the true Parent of theindividual both in soul and body. This is nothing else thanrealizing from the stand-point of the individual what we cannothelp realizing in regard to the original creation of the cosmos--it is the realization that the All-originating Spirit is at oncethe Life and the Substance in each individual here and now, justas it must have been in the origin of all things. Human parentagecounts for nothing--it is only the channel through whichUniversal Spirit has acted for the concentration of an individualcentre; but the ultimate cause of that centre, both in life andsubstance, continues at every moment to be the One sameOriginating Spirit.This recognition cuts away the root of all the power of thenegative, and so in principle it delivers us from all evil, forthe root of evil is the denial of the power of the Spirit toproduce good. When we realize that the Spirit is finding its ownindividualization in us in its two-fold essence as Life andSubstance, then we see that it must be both able and willing tocreate for us all good. The only limit is that which we ourselvesimpose by denying its operation, and when we realize the inherentcreativeness of Spirit we find that there is no reason why weshould stop short at any point and say that it can go no further.Our error is in looking on the life of the body as separate fromthe life of the Spirit, and this error is met by theconsideration that, in its ultimate nature, Substance mustemanate from Spirit and is nothing else than the record ofSpirit's conception of itself as finding expression in space andtime. And when this becomes clear it follows that Substance neednot be taken into calculation at all. The material form stands inthe same relation to Spirit that the image projected on thescreen stands to the slide in the lantern. If we wish to changethe exhibited subject we do not manipulate the reflection on thescreen, but we alter the slide; and in like manner, when we cometo realize the true nature of the creative process, we learn thatthe exterior things are to be changed by a change of the interiorspiritual attitude. Our spiritual attitude will always bedetermined by our conception of our relation to God or InfiniteSpirit; and so when we begin to see that this relation is one ofabsolute reciprocity--that it is the self-recognition of InfiniteSpirit from our own centre of consciousness--then we find thatthe whole Secret of Life consists in simple reliance upon theAllcreating Spirit as consciously identifying itself with us. Ithas, so to say, awakened to a new mode of self-recognitionpeculiar to ourselves, in which we individually form the centreof its creative energy. To realize this is to specialize thePrinciple of Life. The logic of it is simple. We have found thatthe originating movement of Spirit from which all creationproceeds can only be Self-contemplation. Then, since the OriginalSpirit cannot change its nature its self-contemplation throughour own minds must be as creative in, for, and through us as itever was in the beginning; and consequently we find the originalcreative process repeated in ourselves and directed by theconscious thought of our own minds.In all this there is no place for the consideration of  outwardconditions, whether of body or  circumstances; for they are onlyeffects and not the  cause; and therefore when we reach thisstand-point  we cease to take them into our calculations. Instead we employ the method of self-contemplation knowing  that this isthe creative method, and so we  contemplate ourselves as alliedto the infinite Love  and Wisdom of the Divine Spirit which willtake form  through our conscious thought, and so act creatively as a Special Providence entirely devoted to guarding,  guiding,providing for, and illuminating us. The whole  thing is perfectlynatural when seen from a clear  recognition of what the creativeworking of Spirit  must be in itself; and when it is realized inthis  perfectly natural manner all strain and effort to  compelits action ceases--we are at one with the All-creating Powerwhich has now found a new centre in  ourselves from which tocontinue its creative work to  more perfect manifestation thancould be attained  through the unspecialized generic conditionsof the  merely cosmic order.Now this is what Messiah stands for, and therefore it is writtenthat "to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to asmany as believe on His Name." This "belief" is the recognition ofa universal principle and personal reliance upon it as a lawwhich cannot be broken; for it is the Law of the whole creativeprocess specialized in our own individuality. Then, too, howevergreat may be the mystery, the removal and cleansing away of allsin follows as an essential part of this realization of new life;and it is in this sense that we may read all that the Bible tellsus on this aspect of the subject. The PRINCIPLE of it is Love;for when we are reunited to the Parent Spirit in mutualconfidence and love, what room is there on either side for anyremembrance of our past failures?This, then is what Messiah stands for to the individual; but ifwe can conceive a nation based upon such a recognition of itsspecial relation to the Directing Power of the Universe, such apeople must of necessity become the leader of the nations, andthose who oppose it must fail by a self-destructive principleinherent in the very nature of the position they take up. Theleadership resulting from such a national self-recognition, willnot be based upon conquest and compulsion, but will comenaturally. Other nations will enquire the reason for thephenomenal success and prosperity of the favoured people, andfinding this reason in a universal Law, they will begin to applythe same law in the same manner, and thus the same results willspread from country to country until at last the whole earth willbe full of the glory of the Lord. And such a nation, and rathercompany of nations, exists. To trace its present development fromits ancient beginnings is far beyond the scope of this volume,and still more to speculate upon its further growth; but to myreaders on both sides of the Atlantic I may say that this peopleis the Anglo-Saxon race throughout the world. I write these linesupon the historic Hill of Tara; this will convey a hint to manyof my readers. At some future time I may enlarge upon thissubject; but at present my aim is merely to suggest some lines ofthought arising from the Master's saying that "Salvation is ofthe Jews."End of Project Gutenberg Etext of The Dore' Lectures on Mental Science

He had a charming wife, devoted to himand to her children, but with enough love of general approbation tomake herself as popular in the fashionable world as if she sought inits gayeties a refuge from the dulness of domestic life.Amongst the guests at the Beaumanoirs, this evening were two men,seated apart in a small room, and conversing familiarly.  The onemight be about fifty-four; he was tall, strongly built, but notcorpulent, somewhat bald, with black eyebrows, dark eyes, bright andkeen, mobile lips round which there played a shrewd and sometimessarcastic smile.This gentleman, the Right Hon. Gerard Danvers, was a very influentialmember of Parliament.  He had, when young for English public life,attained to high office; but--partly from a great distaste to thedrudgery of administration; partly from a pride of temperament, whichunfitted him for the subordination that a Cabinet owes to its chief;partly, also, from a not uncommon kind of epicurean philosophy, atonce joyous and cynical, which sought the pleasures of life and heldvery cheap its honours--he had obstinately declined to re-enteroffice, and only spoke on rare occasions.  On such occasions hecarried great weight, and, by the brief expression of his opinions,commanded more votes than many an orator infinitely more eloquent.Despite his want of ambition, he was fond of power in his ownway,--power over the people who /had/ power; and, in the love ofpolitical intrigue, he found an amusement for an intellect very subtleand very active.  At this moment he was bent on a new combinationamong the leaders of different sections in the same party, by whichcertain veterans were to retire, and certain younger men to beadmitted into the Administration.  It was an amiable feature in hischaracter that he had a sympathy with the young, and had helped tobring into Parliament, as well as into office, some of the ablest of ageneration later than his own.  He gave them sensible counsel, waspleased when they succeeded, and encouraged them when theyfailed,--always provided that they had stuff enough in them to redeemthe failure; if not, he gently dropped them from his intimacy, butmaintained sufficiently familiar terms with them to be pretty surethat he could influence their votes whenever he so desired.The gentleman with whom he was now conversing was young, aboutfive-and-twenty; not yet in Parliament, but with an intense desire toobtain a seat in it, and with one of those reputations which a youthcarries away from school and college, justified, not by honours purelyacademical, but by an impression of ability and power created on theminds of his contemporaries and endorsed by his elders.  He had donelittle at the University beyond taking a fair degree, except acquiringat the debating society the fame of an exceedingly ready and adroitspeaker.  On quitting college he had written one or two politicalarticles in a quarterly review, which created a sensation; and thoughbelonging to no profession, and having but a small yet independentincome, society was very civil to him, as to a man who would some dayor other attain a position in which he could damage his enemies andserve his friends.  Something in this young man's countenance andbearing tended to favour the credit given to his ability and hispromise.  In his countenance there was no beauty; in his bearing noelegance.  But in that countenance there was vigour, there was energy,there was audacity.  A forehead wide but low, protuberant in thoseorgans over the brow which indicate the qualities fitted forperception and judgment,--qualities for every-day life; eyes of theclear English blue, small, somewhat sunken, vigilant, sagacious,penetrating; a long straight upper lip, significant of resolutepurpose; a mouth in which a student of physiognomy would have detecteda dangerous charm.  The smile was captivating, but it was artificial,surrounded by dimples, and displaying teeth white, small, strong, butdivided from each other.  The expression of that smile would have beenfrank and candid to all who failed to notice that it was not inharmony with the brooding forehead and the steely eye; that it seemedto stand distinct from the rest of the face, like a feature that hadlearned its part.  There was that physical power in the back of thehead which belongs to men who make their way in life,--combative anddestructive.  All gladiators have it; so have great debaters and greatreformers,--that is, reformers who can destroy, but not necessarilyreconstruct.  So, too, in the bearing of the man there was a hardyself-confidence, much too simple and unaffected for his worst enemy tocall it self-conceit.  It was the bearing of one who knew how tomaintain personal dignity without seeming to care about it.  Neverservile to the great, never arrogant to the little; so littleover-refined that it was never vulgar,--a popular bearing.The room in which these gentlemen were seated was separated from thegeneral suite of apartments by a lobby off the landing-place, andserved for Lady Beaumanoir's boudoir.  Very pretty it was, but simplyfurnished, with chintz draperies.  The walls were adorned withdrawings in water-colours, and precious specimens of china on fancifulParian brackets.  At one corner, by a window that looked southward andopened on a spacious balcony, glazed in and filled with flowers, stoodone of those high trellised screens, first invented, I believe, inVienna, and along which ivy is so trained as to form an arbour.The recess thus constructed, and which was completely out of sightfrom the rest of the room, was the hostess's favourite writing-nook.The two men I have described were seated near the screen, and hadcertainly no suspicion that any one could be behind it."Yes," said Mr. Danvers, from an ottoman niched in another recess ofthe room, "I think there will be an opening at Saxboro' soon: Milroywants a Colonial Government; and if we can reconstruct the Cabinet asI propose, he would get one.  Saxboro' would thus be vacant.  But, mydear fellow, Saxboro' is a place to be wooed through love, and onlywon through money.  It demands liberalism from a candidate,--two kindsof liberalism seldom united; the liberalism in opinion which isnatural enough to a very poor man, and the liberalism in expenditurewhich is scarcely to be obtained except from a very rich one.  You maycompute the cost of Saxboro' at L3000 to get in, and about L2000 moreto defend your seat against a petition,--the defeated candidate nearlyalways petitions.  L5000 is a large sum; and the worst of it is, thatthe extreme opinions to which the member for Saxboro' must pledgehimself are a drawback to an official career.  Violent politicians arenot the best raw material out of which to manufacture fortunateplacemen.""The opinions do not so much matter; the expense does.  I cannotafford L5000, or even L3000.""Would not Sir Peter assist?  He has, you say, only one son; and ifanything happen to that son, you are the next heir.""My father quarrelled with Sir Peter, and harassed him by an imprudentand ungracious litigation.  I scarcely think I could apply to him formoney to obtain a seat in Parliament upon the democratic side of thequestion; for, though I know little of his politics, I take it forgranted that a country gentleman of old family and L10,000 a yearcannot well be a democrat.""Then I presume you would not be a democrat if, by the death of yourcousin, you became heir to the Chillinglys.""I am not sure what I might be in that case.  There are times when ademocrat of ancient lineage and good estates could take a very highplace amongst the aristocracy.""Humph! my dear Gordon, /vous irez loin/.""I hope to do so.  Measuring myself against the men of my own day, Ido not see many who should outstrip me.""What sort of a fellow is your cousin Kenelm?  I met him once or twicewhen he was very young, and reading with Welby in London.  People thensaid that he was very clever; he struck me as very odd.""I never saw him, but from all I hear, whether he be clever or whetherhe be odd, he is not likely to do anything in life,--a dreamer.""Writes poetry perhaps?""Capable of it, I dare say."Just then some other guests came into the room, amongst them a lady ofan appearance at once singularly distinguished and singularlyprepossessing, rather above the common height, and with a certainindescribable nobility of air and presence.  Lady Glenalvon was one ofthe queens of the London world, and no queen of that world was everless worldly or more queen-like.  Side by side with the lady was Mr.Chillingly Mivers.  Gordon and Mivers interchanged friendly nods, andthe former sauntered away and was soon lost amid a crowd of otheryoung men, with whom, as he could converse well and lightly on thingswhich interested them, he was rather a favourite, though he was not anintimate associate.  Mr. Danvers retired into a corner of theadjoining lobby, where he favoured the French ambassador with hisviews on the state of Europe and the reconstruction of Cabinets ingeneral."But," said Lady Glenalvon to Chillingly Mivers, "are you quite surethat my old young friend Kenelm is here?  Since you told me so, I havelooked everywhere for him in vain.  I should so much like to see himagain.""I certainly caught a glimpse of him half an hour ago; but before Icould escape from a geologist who was boring me about the Siluriansystem, Kenelm had vanished.""Perhaps it was his ghost!""Well, we certainly live in the most credulous and superstitious ageupon record; and so many people tell me that they converse with thedead under the table that it seems impertinent in me to say that Idon't believe in ghosts.""Tell me some of those incomprehensible stories about table-rapping,"said Lady Glenalvon.  "There is a charming, snug recess here behindthe screen."Scarcely had she entered the recess when she drew back with a startand an exclamation of amaze.  Seated at the table within the recess,his chin resting on his hand, and his face cast down in abstractedrevery, was a young man.  So still was his attitude, so calmlymournful the expression of his face, so estranged did he seem from allthe motley but brilliant assemblage which circled around the solitudehe had made for himself, that he might well have been deemed one ofthose visitants from another world whose secrets the intruder hadwished to learn.  Of that intruder's presence he was evidentlyunconscious.  Recovering her surprise, she stole up to him, placed herhand on his shoulder, and uttered his name in a low gentle voice.  Atthat sound Kenelm Chillingly looked up."Do you not remember me?" asked Lady Glenalvon.  Before he couldanswer, Mivers, who had followed the marchioness into the recess,interposed."My dear Kenelm, how are you?  When did you come to London?  Why haveyou not called on me; and what on earth are you hiding yourself for?"Kenelm had now recovered the self-possession which he rarely lost longin the presence of others.  He returned cordially his kinsman'sgreeting, and kissed with his wonted chivalrous grace the fair handwhich the lady withdrew from his shoulder and extended to hispressure.  "Remember you!" he said to Lady Glenalvon with thekindliest expression of his soft dark eyes; "I am not so far advancedtowards the noon of life as to forget the sunshine that brightened itsmorning.  My dear Mivers, your questions are easily answered.  Iarrived in England two weeks ago, stayed at Exmundham till thismorning, to-day dined with Lord Thetford, whose acquaintance I madeabroad, and was persuaded by him to come here and be introduced to hisfather and mother, the Beaumanoirs.  After I had undergone thatceremony, the sight of so many strange faces frightened me intoshyness.  Entering this room at a moment when it was quite deserted, Iresolved to turn hermit behind the screen.""Why, you must have seen your cousin Gordon as you came into theroom.""But you forget I don't know him by sight.  However, there was no onein the room when I entered; a little later some others came in, for Iheard a faint buzz, like that of persons talking in a whisper.However, I was no eavesdropper, as a person behind a screen is on thedramatic stage."This was true.  Even had Gordon and Danvers talked in a louder tone,Kenelm had been too absorbed in his own thoughts to have heard a wordof their conversation."You ought to know young Gordon; he is a very clever fellow, and hasan ambition to enter Parliament.  I hope no old family quarrel betweenhis bear of a father and dear Sir Peter will make you object to meethim.""Sir Peter is the most forgiving of men, but he would scarcely forgiveme if I declined to meet a cousin who had never offended him.""Well said.  Come and meet Gordon at breakfast to-morrow,--teno'clock.  I am still in the old rooms."While the kinsmen thus conversed, Lady Glenalvon had seated herself onthe couch beside Kenelm, and was quietly observing his countenance.Now she spoke.  "My dear Mr. Mivers, you will have many opportunitiesof talking with Kenelm; do not grudge me five minutes' talk with himnow.""I leave your ladyship alone in your hermitage.  How all the men inthis assembly will envy the hermit!"CHAPTER II."I AM glad to see you once more in the world," said Lady Glenalvon;"and I trust that you are now prepared to take that part in it whichought to be no mean one if you do justice to your talents and yournature."KENELM.--"When you go to the theatre, and see one of the pieces whichappear now to be the fashion, which would you rather be,--an actor ora looker-on?"LADY GLENALVON.--"My dear young friend, your question saddens me."(After a pause.)--"But though I used a stage metaphor when I expressedmy hope that you would take no mean part in the world, the world isnot really a theatre.  Life admits of no lookers-on.  Speak to mefrankly, as you used to do.  Your face retains its old melancholyexpression.  Are you not happy?"KENELM.--"Happy, as mortals go, I ought to be.  I do not think I amunhappy.  If my temper be melancholic, melancholy has a happiness ofits own.  Milton shows that there are as many charms in life to befound on the /Penseroso/ side of it as there are on the /Allegro/."LADY GLENALVON.--"Kenelm, you saved the life of my poor son, and when,later, he was taken from me, I felt as if he had commended you to mycare.  When at the age of sixteen, with a boy's years and a man'sheart, you came to London, did I not try to be to you almost as amother? and did you not often tell me that you could confide to me thesecrets of your heart more readily than to any other?""You were to me," said Kenelm, with emotion, "that most precious andsustaining good genius which a youth can find at the threshold oflife,--a woman gently wise, kindly sympathizing, shaming him by thespectacle of her own purity from all grosser errors, elevating himfrom mean tastes and objects by the exquisite, ineffable loftiness ofsoul which is only found in the noblest order of womanhood.  Come, Iwill open my heart to you still.  I fear it is more wayward than ever.It still feels estranged from the companionship and pursuits naturalto my age and station.  However, I have been seeking to brace andharden my nature, for the practical ends of life, by travel andadventure, chiefly among rougher varieties of mankind than we meet indrawing-rooms.  Now, in compliance with the duty I owe to my dearfather's wishes, I come back to these circles, which under yourauspices I entered in boyhood, and which even then seemed to me soinane and artificial.  Take a part in the world of these circles; suchis your wish.  My answer is brief.  I have been doing my best toacquire a motive power, and have not succeeded.  I see nothing that Icare to strive for, nothing that I care to gain.  The very times inwhich we live are to me, as to Hamlet, out of joint; and I am not bornlike Hamlet to set them right.  Ah! if I could look on society throughthe spectacles with which the poor hidalgo in 'Gil Blas' looked on hismeagre board,--spectacles by which cherries appear the size ofpeaches, and tomtits as large as turkeys!  The imagination which isnecessary to ambition is a great magnifier.""I have known more than one man, now very eminent, very active, who atyour age felt the same estrangement from the practical pursuits ofothers.""And what reconciled those men to such pursuits?""That diminished sense of individual personality, that unconsciousfusion of one's own being into other existences, which belong to homeand marriage.""I don't object to home, but I do to marriage.""Depend on it there is no home for man where there is no woman.""Prettily said.  In that case I resign the home.""Do you mean seriously to tell me that you never see the woman youcould love enough to make her your wife, and never enter any home thatyou do not quit with a touch of envy at the happiness of marriedlife?""Seriously, I never see such a woman; seriously, I never enter such ahome.""Patience, then; your time will come, and I hope it is at hand.Listen to me.  It was only yesterday that I felt an indescribablelonging to see you again,--to know your address that I might write toyou; for yesterday, when a certain young lady left my house after aweek's visit, I said this girl would make a perfect wife, and, aboveall, the exact wife to suit Kenelm Chillingly.""Kenelm Chillingly is very glad to hear that this young lady has leftyour house.""But she has not left London: she is here to-night.  She only stayedwith me till her father came to town, and the house he had taken forthe season was vacant; those events happened yesterday.""Fortunate events for me: they permit me to call on you withoutdanger.""Have you no curiosity to know, at least, who and what is the younglady who appears to me so well suited to you?""No curiosity, but a vague sensation of alarm.""Well, I cannot talk pleasantly with you while you are in thisirritating mood, and it is time to quit the hermitage.  Come, thereare many persons here, with some of whom you should renew oldacquaintance, and to some of whom I should like to make you known.""I am prepared to follow Lady Glenalvon wherever she deigns to leadme,--except to the altar with another."CHAPTER III.THE rooms were now full,--not overcrowded, but full,--and it wasrarely even in that house that so many distinguished persons werecollected together.  A young man thus honoured by so /grande/ a dameas Lady Glenalvon could not but be cordially welcomed by all to whomshe presented him, Ministers and Parliamentary leaders, ball-givers,and beauties in vogue,--even authors and artists; and there wassomething in Kenelm Chillingly, in his striking countenance andfigure, in that calm ease of manner natural to his indifference toeffect, which seemed to justify the favour shown to him by thebrilliant princess of fashion and mark him out for generalobservation.That first evening of his reintroduction to the polite world was asuccess which few young men of his years achieve.  He produced asensation.  Just as the rooms were thinning, Lady Glenalvon whisperedto Kenelm,--"Come this way: there is one person I must reintroduce you to; thankme for it hereafter."Kenelm followed the marchioness, and found himself face to face withCecilia Travers.  She was leaning on her father's arm, looking veryhandsome, and her beauty was heightened by the blush which overspreadher cheeks as Kenelm Chillingly approached.Travers greeted him with great cordiality; and Lady Glenalvon askinghim to escort her to the refreshment-room, Kenelm had no option but tooffer his arm to Cecilia.Kenelm felt somewhat embarrassed.  "Have you been long in town, MissTravers?""A little more than a week, but we only settled into our houseyesterday.""Ah, indeed! were you then the young lady who--"  He stopped short,and his face grew gentler and graver in its expression."The young lady who--what?" asked Cecilia with a smile."Who has been staying with Lady Glenalvon?""Yes; did she tell you?""She did not mention your name, but praised that young lady so justlythat I ought to have guessed it."Cecilia made some not very audible answer, and on entering therefreshment-room other young men gathered round her, and LadyGlenalvon and Kenelm remained silent in the midst of a generalsmall-talk.  When Travers, after giving his address to Kenelm, and, ofcourse, pressing him to call, left the house with Cecilia, Kenelm saidto Lady Glenalvon, musingly, "So that is the young lady in whom I wasto see my fate: you knew that we had met before?""Yes, she told me when and where.  Besides, it is not two years sinceyou wrote to me from her father's house.  Do you forget?""Ah," said Kenelm, so abstractedly that he seemed to be dreaming, "noman with his eyes open rushes on his fate: when he does so his sightis gone.  Love is blind.  They say the blind are very happy, yet Inever met a blind man who would not recover his sight if he could."CHAPTER IV.Mr. CHILLINGLY MIVERS never gave a dinner at his own rooms.  When hedid give a dinner it was at Greenwich or Richmond.  But he gavebreakfast-parties pretty often, and they were considered pleasant.  Hehad handsome bachelor apartments in Grosvenor Street, daintilyfurnished, with a prevalent air of exquisite neatness, a good librarystored with books of reference, and adorned with presentation copiesfrom authors of the day, very beautifully bound.  Though the roomserved for the study of the professed man of letters, it had none ofthe untidy litter which generally characterizes the study of one whosevocation it is to deal with books and papers.  Even the implements forwriting were not apparent, except when required.  They lay concealedin a vast cylinder bureau, French made, and French polished.  Withinthat bureau were numerous pigeon-holes and secret drawers, and aprofound well with a separate patent lock.  In the well were depositedthe articles intended for publication in "The Londoner," proof-sheets,etc.; pigeon-holes were devoted to ordinary correspondence; secretdrawers to confidential notes, and outlines of biographies of eminentmen now living, but intended to be completed for publication the dayafter their death.No man wrote such funeral compositions with a livelier pen than thatof Chillingly Mivers; and the large and miscellaneous circle of hisvisiting acquaintances allowed him to ascertain, whether byauthoritative report or by personal observation, the signs of mortaldisease in the illustrious friends whose dinners he accepted, andwhose failing pulses he instinctively felt in returning the pressureof their hands; so that he was often able to put the finishing-stroketo their obituary memorials days, weeks, even months, before theirfate took the public by surprise.  That cylinder bureau was in harmonywith the secrecy in which this remarkable man shrouded the productionsof his brain.  In his literary life Mivers had no "I," there he wasever the inscrutable, mysterious "We."  He was only "I" when you methim in the world, and called him Mivers.Adjoining the library on one side was a small dining or ratherbreakfast room, hung with valuable pictures,--presents from livingpainters.  Many of these painters had been severely handled by Mr.Mivers in his existence as "We,"--not always in "The Londoner."  Hismost pungent criticisms were often contributed to other intellectualjournals conducted by members of the same intellectual clique.Painters knew not how contemptuously "We" had treated them when theymet Mr. Mivers.  His "I" was so complimentary that they sent him atribute of their gratitude.On the other side was his drawing-room, also enriched by many gifts,chiefly from fair hands,--embroidered cushions and table-covers, bitsof Sevres or old Chelsea, elegant knick-knacks of all kinds.Fashionable authoresses paid great court to Mr. Mivers; and in thecourse of his life as a single man, he had other female adorersbesides fashionable authoresses.Mr. Mivers had already returned from his early constitutional walk inthe Park, and was now seated by the cylinder /secretaire/ with amild-looking man, who was one of the most merciless contributors to"The Londoner" and no unimportant councillor in the oligarchy of theclique that went by the name of the "Intellectuals.""Well," said Mivers, languidly, "I can't even get through the book; itis as dull as the country in November.  But, as you justly say, thewriter is an 'Intellectual,' and a clique would be anything butintellectual if it did not support its members.  Review the bookyourself; mind and make the dulness of it the signal proof of itsmerit.  Say: 'To the ordinary class of readers this exquisite work mayappear less brilliant than the flippant smartness of'--any otherauthor you like to name; 'but to the well educated and intelligentevery line is pregnant with,' etc.  By the way, when we come by and byto review the exhibition at Burlington House, there is one painterwhom we must try our best to crush.  I have not seen his picturesmyself, but he is a new man; and our friend, who has seen him, isterribly jealous of him, and says that if the good judges do not puthim down at once, the villanous taste of the public will set him up asa prodigy.  A low-lived fellow too, I hear.  There is the name of theman and the subject of the pictures.  See to it when the time comes.Meanwhile, prepare the way for onslaught on the pictures by occasionalsneers at the painter."  Here Mr. Mivers took out of his cylinder aconfidential note from the jealous rival and handed it to hismild-looking /confrere/; then rising, he said, "I fear we must suspendour business till to-morrow; I expect two young cousins to breakfast."As soon as the mild-looking man was gone, Mr. Mivers sauntered to hisdrawing-room window, amiably offering a lump of sugar to a canary-birdsent to him as a present the day before, and who, in the gilded cagewhich made part of the present, scanned him suspiciously and refusedthe sugar.Time had remained very gentle in its dealings with Chillingly Mivers.He scarcely looked a day older than when he was first presented to thereader on the birth of his kinsman Kenelm.  He was reaping the fruitof his own sage maxims.  Free from whiskers and safe in wig, there wasno sign of gray, no suspicion of dye.  Superiority to passion,abnegation of sorrow, indulgence of amusement, avoidance of excess,had kept away the crow's-feet, preserved the elasticity of his frameand the unflushed clearness of his gentlemanlike complexion.  The dooropened, and a well-dressed valet, who had lived long enough withMivers to grow very much like him, announced Mr. Chillingly Gordon."Good morning," said Mivers; "I was much pleased to see you talking solong and so familiarly with Danvers: others, of course, observed it,and it added a step to your career.  It does you great good to be seenin a drawing-room talking apart with a Somebody.  But may I ask if thetalk itself was satisfactory?""Not at all: Danvers throws cold water on the notion of Saxboro', anddoes not even hint that his party will help me to any other opening.Party has few openings at its disposal nowadays for any young man.The schoolmaster being abroad has swept away the school for statesmenas he has swept away the school for actors,--an evil, and an evil of afar greater consequence to the destinies of the nation than any goodlikely to be got from the system that succeeded it.""But it is of no use railing against things that can't be helped.  IfI were you, I would postpone all ambition of Parliament and read forthe bar.""The advice is sound, but too unpalatable to be taken.  I am resolvedto find a seat in the House, and where there is a will there is away.""I am not so sure of that.""But I am.""Judging by what your contemporaries at the University tell me of yourspeeches at the Debating Society, you were not then an ultra-Radical.But it is only an ultra-Radical who has a chance of success atSaxboro'.""I am no fanatic in politics.  There is much to be said on all sides:/coeteris paribus/, I prefer the winning side to the losing; nothingsucceeds like success.""Ay, but in politics there is always reaction.  The winning side oneday may be the losing side another.  The losing side represents aminority, and a minority is sure to comprise more intellect than amajority: in the long run intellect will force its way, get a majorityand then lose it, because with a majority it will become stupid.""Cousin Mivers, does not the history of the world show you that asingle individual can upset all theories as to the comparative wisdomof the few or the many?  Take the wisest few you can find, and one manof genius not a tithe so wise crushes them into powder.  But then thatman of genius, though he despises the many, must make use of them.That done, he rules them.  Don't you see how in free countriespolitical destinations resolve themselves into individualimpersonations?  At a general election it is one name around whichelectors rally.  The candidate may enlarge as much as he pleases onpolitical principles, but all his talk will not win him votes enoughfor success, unless he says, 'I go with Mr. A.,' the minister, or withMr. Z., the chief of the opposition.  It was not the Tories who beatthe Whigs when Mr. Pitt dissolved Parliament.  It was Mr. Pitt whobeat Mr. Fox, with whom in general political principle--slave-trade,Roman Catholic emancipation, Parliamentary reform--he certainly agreedmuch more than he did with any man in his own cabinet.""Take care, my young cousin," cried Mivers, in accents of alarm;"don't set up for a man of genius.  Genius is the worst quality apublic man can have nowadays: nobody heeds it, and everybody isjealous of it.""Pardon me, you mistake; my remark was purely objective, and intendedas a reply to your argument.  I prefer at present to go with the manybecause it is the winning side. If we then want a man of genius tokeep it the winning side, by subjugating its partisans to his will, hewill be sure to come.  The few will drive him to us, for the few arealways the enemies of the one man of genius.  It is they whodistrust,--it is they who are jealous,--not the many.  You haveallowed your judgment, usually so clear, to be somewhat dimmed by yourexperience as a critic.  The critics are the few.  They haveinfinitely more culture than the many.  But when a man of real geniusappears and asserts himself, the critics are seldom such fair judgesof him as the many are.  If he be not one of their oligarchicalclique, they either abuse, or disparage, or affect to ignore him;though a time at last comes when, having gained the many, the criticsacknowledge him.  But the difference between the man of action and theauthor is this, that the author rarely finds this acknowledgment tillhe is dead, and it is necessary to the man of action to enforce itwhile he is alive.  But enough of this speculation: you ask me to meetKenelm; is he not coming?""Yes, but I did not ask him till ten o'clock.  I asked you athalf-past nine, because I wished to hear about Danvers and Saxboro',and also to prepare you somewhat for your introduction to your cousin.I must be brief as to the last, for it is only five minutes to thehour, and he is a man likely to be punctual.  Kenelm is in all waysyour opposite.  I don't know whether he is cleverer or less clever;there is no scale of measurement between you: but he is wholly void ofambition, and might possibly assist yours.  He can do what he likeswith Sir Peter; and considering how your poor father--a worthy man,but cantankerous--harassed and persecuted Sir Peter, because Kenelmcame between the estate and you, it is probable that Sir Peter bearsyou a grudge, though Kenelm declares him incapable of it; and it wouldbe well if you could annul that grudge in the father by conciliatingthe goodwill of the son.""I should be glad so to annul it; but what is Kenelm's weak side?--theturf? the hunting-field? women? poetry?  One can only conciliate a manby getting on his weak side.""Hist!  I see him from the windows.  Kenelm's weak side was, when Iknew him some years ago, and I rather fancy it still is--""Well, make haste!  I hear his ring at your door-bell.""A passionate longing to find ideal truth in real life.""Ah!" said Gordon, "as I thought,--a mere dreamer"CHAPTER V.KENELM entered the room.  The young cousins were introduced, shookhands, receded a step, and gazed at each other.  It is scarcelypossible to conceive a greater contrast outwardly than that betweenthe two Chillingly representatives of the rising generation.  Each wassilently impressed by the sense of that contrast.  Each felt that thecontrast implied antagonism, and that if they two met in the samearena it must be as rival combatants; still, by some mysteriousintuition, each felt a certain respect for the other, each divined inthe other a power that he could not fairly estimate, but against whichhis own power would be strongly tasked to contend.  So might exchangelooks a thorough-bred deer-hound and a half-bred mastiff: thebystander could scarcely doubt which was the nobler animal; but hemight hesitate which to bet on, if the two came to deadly quarrel.Meanwhile the thorough-bred deer-hound and the half-bred mastiffsniffed at each other in polite salutation.  Gordon was the first togive tongue."I have long wished to know you personally," said he, throwing intohis voice and manner that delicate kind of deference which a well-borncadet owes to the destined head of his house.  "I cannot conceive howI missed you last night at Lady Beaumanoir's, where Mivers tells me hemet you; but I left early,"Here Mivers led the way to the breakfast-room, and, there seated, thehost became the principal talker, running with lively glibness overthe principal topics of the day,--the last scandal, the last new book,the reform of the army, the reform of the turf, the critical state ofSpain, and the debut of an Italian singer.  He seemed an embodiedJournal, including the Leading Article, the Law Reports, ForeignIntelligence, the Court Circular, down to the Births, Deaths, andMarriages.  Gordon from time to time interrupted this flow of soulwith brief, trenchant remarks, which evinced his own knowledge of thesubjects treated, and a habit of looking on all subjects connectedwith the pursuits and business of mankind from a high groundappropriated to himself, and through the medium of that blue glasswhich conveys a wintry aspect to summer landscapes.  Kenelm saidlittle, but listened attentively.The conversation arrested its discursive nature, to settle upon apolitical chief, the highest in fame and station of that party towhich Mivers professed--not to belong, he belonged to himself alone,but to appropinquate.  Mivers spoke of this chief with the greatestdistrust, and in a spirit of general depreciation.  Gordon acquiescedin the distrust and the depreciation, adding, "But he is master of theposition, and must, of course, be supported through thick and thin forthe present.""Yes, for the present," said Mivers, "one has no option.  But you willsee some clever articles in 'The Londoner' towards the close of thesession, which will damage him greatly, by praising him in the wrongplace, and deepening the alarm of important followers,--an alarm nowat work, though suppressed."Here Kenelm asked, in humble tones, why Gordon thought that a ministerhe considered so untrustworthy and dangerous must for the present besupported through thick and thin."Because at present a member elected so to support him would lose hisseat if he did not: needs must when the devil drives."KENELM.--"When the devil drives, I should have thought it better toresign one's seat on the coach; perhaps one might be of some use, outof it, in helping to put on the drag."MIVERS.--"Cleverly said, Kenelm.  But, metaphor apart, Gordon isright.  A young politician must go with his party; a veteranjournalist like myself is more independent.  So long as the journalistblames everybody, he will have plenty of readers."Kenelm made no reply, and Gordon changed the conversation from men tomeasures.  He spoke of some Bills before Parliament with remarkableability, evincing much knowledge of the subject, much criticalacuteness, illustrating their defects, and proving the danger of theirultimate consequences.Kenelm was greatly struck with the vigour of this cold, clear mind,and owned to himself that the House of Commons was a fitting place forits development."But," said Mivers, "would you not be obliged to defend these Bills ifyou were member for Saxboro'?""Before I answer your question, answer me this: dangerous as the Billsare, is it not necessary that they shall pass?  Have not the public soresolved?""There can be no doubt of that.""Then the member for Saxboro' cannot be strong enough to go againstthe public.""Progress of the age!" said Kenelm, musingly.  "Do you think the classof gentlemen will long last in England?""What do you call gentlemen?  The aristocracy by birth?--the/gentilshommes/?""Nay, I suppose no laws can take away a man's ancestors, and a classof well-born men is not to be exterminated.  But a mere class ofwell-born men--without duties, responsibilities, or sentiment of thatwhich becomes good birth in devotion to country or individualhonour--does no good to a nation.  It is a misfortune which statesmenof democratic creed ought to recognize, that the class of thewell-born cannot be destroyed: it must remain as it remained in Romeand remains in France, after all efforts to extirpate it, as the mostdangerous class of citizens when you deprive it of the attributeswhich made it the most serviceable.  I am not speaking of that class;I speak of that unclassified order peculiar to England, which, nodoubt, forming itself originally from the ideal standard of honour andtruth supposed to be maintained by the /gentilshommes/, or well-born,no longer requires pedigrees and acres to confer upon its members thedesignation of gentleman; and when I hear a 'gentleman' say that hehas no option but to think one thing and say another, at whatever riskto his country, I feel as if in the progress of the age the class ofgentleman was about to be superseded by some finer development ofspecies."Therewith Kenelm rose, and would have taken his departure, if Gordonhad not seized his hand and detained him."My dear cousin, if I may so call you," he said, with the frank mannerwhich was usual to him, and which suited well the bold expression ofhis face and the clear ring of his voice, "I am one of those who, froman over-dislike to sentimentality and cant, often make those notintimately acquainted with them think worse of their principles thanthey deserve.  It may be quite true that a man who goes with his partydislikes the measures he feels bound to support, and says so openlywhen among friends and relations, yet that man is not therefore devoidof loyalty and honour; and I trust, when you know me better, you willnot think it likely I should derogate from that class of gentlemen towhich we both belong.""Pardon me if I seemed rude," answered Kenelm; "ascribe it to myignorance of the necessities of public life.  It struck me that wherea politician thought a thing evil, he ought not to support it as good.But I dare say I am mistaken.""Entirely mistaken," said Mivers, "and for this reason: in politicsformerly there was a direct choice between good and evil.  That rarelyexists now.  Men of high education, having to choose whether to acceptor reject a measure forced upon their option by constituent bodies ofvery low education, are called upon to weigh evil against evil,--theevil of accepting or the evil of rejecting; and if they resolve on thefirst, it is as the lesser evil of the two.""Your definition is perfect," said Gordon, "and I am contented to reston it my excuse for what my cousin deems insincerity.""I suppose that is real life," said Kenelm, with his mournful smile."Of course it is," said Mivers."Every day I live," sighed Kenelm, "still more confirms my convictionthat real life is a phantasmal sham.  How absurd it is in philosophersto deny the existence of apparitions! what apparitions we, living men,must seem to the ghosts!           "'The spirits of the wise     Sit in the clouds and mock us.'"CHAPTER VI.CHILLINGLY GORDON did not fail to confirm his acquaintance withKenelm.  He very often looked in upon him of a morning, sometimesjoined him in his afternoon rides, introduced him to men of his ownset who were mostly busy members of Parliament, rising barristers, orpolitical journalists, but not without a proportion of brilliantidlers,--club men, sporting men, men of fashion, rank, and fortune.He did so with a purpose, for these persons spoke well of him,--spokewell not only of his talents, but of his honourable character.  Hisgeneral nickname amongst them was "HONEST GORDON."  Kenelm at firstthought this sobriquet must be ironical; not a bit of it.  It wasgiven to him on account of the candour and boldness with which heexpressed opinions embodying that sort of cynicism which is vulgarlycalled "the absence of humbug."  The man was certainly no hypocrite;he affected no beliefs which he did not entertain.  And he had veryfew beliefs in anything, except the first half of the adage, "Everyman for himself,--and God for us all."But whatever Chillingly Gordon's theoretical disbeliefs in thingswhich make the current creed of the virtuous, there was nothing in hisconduct which evinced predilection for vices: he was strictly uprightin all his dealings, and in delicate matters of honour was a favouriteumpire amongst his coevals.  Though so frankly ambitious, no one couldaccuse him of attempting to climb on the shoulders of patrons.  Therewas nothing servile in his nature; and, though he was perfectlyprepared to bribe electors if necessary, no money could have boughthimself.  His one master-passion was the desire of power.  He sneeredat patriotism as a worn-out prejudice, at philanthropy as asentimental catch-word.  He did not want to serve his country, but torule it.  He did not want to raise mankind, but to rise himself.  Hewas therefore unscrupulous, unprincipled, as hungerers after power foritself too often are; yet still if he got power he would probably useit well, from the clearness and strength of his mental perceptions.The impression he made on Kenelm may be seen in the followingletter:--TO SIR PETER CHILLINGLY, BART., ETC.MY DEAR FATHER,--You and my dear mother will be pleased to hear thatLondon continues very polite to me: that "arida nutrix leonum" enrollsme among the pet class of lions which ladies of fashion admit into thesociety of their lapdogs.  It is somewhere about six years since I wasallowed to gaze on this peep-show through the loopholes of Mr. Welby'sretreat.  It appears to me, perhaps erroneously, that even within thatshort space of time the tone of "society" is perceptibly changed.That the change is for the better is an assertion I leave to those whobelong to the /progressista/ party.I don't think nearly so many young ladies six years ago painted theireyelids and dyed their hair: a few of them there might be, imitatorsof the slang invented by schoolboys and circulated through the mediumof small novelists; they might use such expressions as "stunning,""cheek," "awfully jolly," etc.  But now I find a great many who haveadvanced to a slang beyond that of verbal expressions,--a slang ofmind, a slang of sentiment, a slang in which very little seems left ofthe woman and nothing at all of the lady.Newspaper essayists assert that the young men of the day are to blamefor this; that the young men like it; and the fair husband-anglersdress their flies in the colours most likely to attract a nibble.Whether this excuse be the true one I cannot pretend to judge; but itstrikes me that the men about my own age who affect to be fast are amore languid race than the men from ten to twenty years older, whomthey regard as /slow/.  The habit of dram-drinking in the morning is avery new idea, an idea greatly in fashion at the moment.  Adonis callsfor a "pick-me-up" before he has strength enough to answer a/billet-doux/ from Venus.  Adonis has not the strength to get nobly drunk, but his delicate constitution requires stimulants, and he isalways tippling.The men of high birth or renown for social success belonging, my dearfather, to your time, are still distinguished by an air of goodbreeding, by a style of conversation more or less polished and notwithout evidences of literary culture, from men of the same rank in mygeneration, who appear to pride themselves on respecting nobody andknowing nothing, not even grammar.  Still we are assured that theworld goes on steadily improving.  /That/ new idea is in full vigour.Society in the concrete has become wonderfully conceited as to its ownprogressive excellences, and the individuals who form the concreteentertain the same complacent opinion of themselves.  There are, ofcourse, even in my brief and imperfect experience, many exceptions towhat appear to me the prevalent characteristics of the risinggeneration in "society."  Of these exceptions I must content myselfwith naming the most remarkable.  /Place aux dames/, the first I nameis Cecilia Travers.  She and her father are now in town, and I meetthem frequently.  I can conceive no civilized era in the world which awoman like Cecilia Travers would not grace and adorn, because she isessentially the type of woman as man likes to imagine woman; namely,on the fairest side of the womanly character.  And I say "woman"rather than "girl," because among "Girls of the Period" CeciliaTravers cannot be classed.  You might call her damsel, virgin, maiden,but you could no more call her girl than you could call a well-bornFrench demoiselle /fille/.  She is handsome enough to please the eyeof any man, however fastidious, but not that kind of beauty whichdazzles all men too much to fascinate one man; for--speaking, thankHeaven, from mere theory--I apprehend that the love for woman has init a strong sense of property; that one requires to individualizeone's possession as being wholly one's own, and not a possession whichall the public are invited to admire.  I can readily understand how arich man, who has what is called a show place, in which the splendidrooms and the stately gardens are open to all inspectors, so that hehas no privacy in his own demesnes, runs away to a pretty cottagewhich he has all to himself, and of which he can say, "/This/ is home;/this/ is all mine."But there are some kinds of beauty which are eminently showplaces,--which the public think they have as much a right to admire asthe owner has; and the show place itself would be dull and perhapsfall out of repair, if the public could be excluded from the sight ofit.The beauty of Cecilia Travers is not that of a show place.  There is afeeling of safety in her.  If Desdemona had been like her, Othellowould not have been jealous.  But then Cecilia would not have deceivedher father; nor I think have told a blackamoor that she wished "Heavenhad made her such a man."  Her mind harmonizes with her person: it isa companionable mind.  Her talents are not showy, but, take themaltogether, they form a pleasant whole: she has good sense enough inthe practical affairs of life, and enough of that ineffable womanlygift called tact to counteract the effects of whimsical natures likemine, and yet enough sense of the humouristic views of life not totake too literally all that a whimsical man like myself may say.  Asto temper, one never knows what a woman's temper is--till one puts herout of it.  But I imagine hers, in its normal state, to be serene, anddisposed to be cheerful.  Now, my dear father, if you were not one ofthe cleverest of men you would infer from this eulogistic mention ofCecilia Travers that I was in love with her.  But you no doubt willdetect the truth that a man in love with a woman does not weigh hermerits with so steady a hand as that which guides this steel pen.  Iam not in love with Cecilia Travers.  I wish I were.  When LadyGlenalvon, who remains wonderfully kind to me, says, day after day,"Cecilia Travers would make you a perfect wife," I have no answer togive; but I don't feel the least inclined to ask Cecilia Travers ifshe would waste her perfection on one who so coldly concedes it.I find that she persisted in rejecting the man whom her father wishedher to marry, and that he has consoled himself by marrying somebodyelse.  No doubt other suitors as worthy will soon present themselves.Oh, dearest of all my friends,--sole friend whom I regard as aconfidant,--shall I ever be in love? and if not, why not?  Sometimes Ifeel as if, with love as with ambition, it is because I have someimpossible ideal in each, that I must always remain indifferent to thesort of love and the sort of ambition which are within my reach.  Ihave an idea that if I did love, I should love as intensely as Romeo,and that thought inspires me with vague forebodings of terror; and ifI did find an object to arouse my ambition, I could be as earnest inits pursuit as--whom shall I name?--Caesar or Cato?  I like Cato'sambition the better of the two.  But people nowadays call ambition animpracticable crotchet, if it be invested on the losing side.  Catowould have saved Rome from the mob and the dictator; but Rome couldnot be saved, and Cato falls on his own sword.  Had we a Cato now, theverdict at a coroner's inquest would be, "suicide while in a state ofunsound mind;" and the verdict would have been proved by his senselessresistance to a mob and a dictator!  Talking of ambition, I come tothe other exception to the youth of the day; I have named a/demoiselle/, I now name a /damoiseau/.  Imagine a man of aboutfive-and-twenty, and who is morally about fifty years older than ahealthy man of sixty,--imagine him with the brain of age and theflower of youth; with a heart absorbed into the brain, and giving warmblood to frigid ideas: a man who sneers at everything I call lofty,yet would do nothing that he thinks mean; to whom vice and virtue areas indifferent as they were to the Aesthetics of Goethe; who wouldnever jeopardize his career as a practical reasoner by an imprudentvirtue, and never sully his reputation by a degrading vice.  Imaginethis man with an intellect keen, strong, ready, unscrupulous,dauntless,--all cleverness and no genius.  Imagine this man, and thendo not be astonished when I tell you he is a Chillingly.The Chillingly race culminates in him, and becomes Chillinglyest.  Infact, it seems to me that we live in a day precisely suited to theChillingly idiosyncrasies.  During the ten centuries or more that ourrace has held local habitation and a name, it has been as airynothings.  Its representatives lived in hot-blooded times, and werecompelled to skulk in still water with their emblematic daces.  Butthe times now, my dear father, are so cold-blooded that you can't betoo cold-blooded to prosper.  What could Chillingly Mivers have beenin an age when people cared twopence-halfpenny about their religiouscreeds, and their political parties deemed their cause was sacred andtheir leaders were heroes?  Chillingly Mivers would not have foundfive subscribers to "The Londoner."  But now "The Londoner" is thefavourite organ of the intellectual public; it sneers away all thefoundations of the social system, without an attempt atreconstruction; and every new journal set up, if it keep its headabove water, models itself on "The Londoner."  Chillingly Mivers is agreat man, and the most potent writer of the age, though nobody knowswhat he has written.  Chillingly Gordon is a still more notableinstance of the rise of the Chillingly worth in the modern market.There is a general impression in the most authoritative circles thatChillingly Gordon will have high rank in the van of the coming men.His confidence in himself is so thorough that it infects all with whomhe comes into contact,--myself included.He said to me the other day, with a /sang-froid/ worthy of the iciestChillingly, "I mean to be Prime Minister of England: it is only aquestion of time."  Now, if Chillingly Gordon is to be Prime Minister,it will be because the increasing cold of our moral and socialatmosphere will exactly suit the development of his talents.He is the man above all others to argue down the declaimers ofold-fashioned sentimentalities,--love of country, care for itsposition among nations, zeal for its honour, pride in its renown.(Oh, if you could hear him philosophically and logically sneer awaythe word "prestige"!)  Such notions are fast being classified as"bosh."  And when that classification is complete,--when England hasno colonies to defend, no navy to pay for, no interest in the affairsof other nations, and has attained to the happy condition ofHolland,--then Chillingly Gordon will be her Prime Minister.Yet while, if ever I am stung into political action, it will be byabnegation of the Chillingly attributes, and in opposition, howeverhopeless, to Chillingly Gordon, I feel that this man cannot besuppressed, and ought to have fair play; his ambition will beinfinitely more dangerous if it become soured by delay.  I propose, mydear father, that you should have the honour of laying this cleverkinsman under an obligation, and enabling him to enter Parliament.  Inour last conversation at Exmundham, you told me of the frankresentment of Gordon /pere/, when my coming into the world shut himout from the Exmundham inheritance; you confided to me your intentionat that time to lay by yearly a sum that might ultimately serve as aprovision for Gordon /fils/, and as some compensation for the loss ofhis expectations when you realized your hope of an heir; you told mealso how this generous intention on your part had been frustrated by anatural indignation at the elder Gordon's conduct in his harassing andcostly litigation, and by the addition you had been tempted to make tothe estate in a purchase which added to its acreage, but at a rate ofinterest which diminished your own income, and precluded thepossibility of further savings.  Now, chancing to meet your lawyer,Mr. Vining, the other day, I learned from him that it had been long awish which your delicacy prevented your naming to me, that I, to whomthe fee-simple descends, should join with you in cutting off theentail and resettling the estate.  He showed me what an advantage thiswould be to the property, because it would leave your hands free formany improvements in which I heartily go with the progress of the age,for which, as merely tenant for life, you could not raise the moneyexcept upon ruinous terms; new cottages for labourers, new buildingsfor tenants, the consolidation of some old mortgages and charges onthe rent-roll, etc.  And allow me to add that I should like to make alarge increase to the jointure of my dear mother.  Vining says, too,that there is a part of the outlying land which, as being near a town,could be sold to considerable profit if the estate were resettled.Let us hasten to complete the necessary deeds, and so obtain theL20,000 required for the realization of your noble and, let me add,your just desire to do something for Chillingly Gordon.  In the newdeeds of settlement we could insure the power of willing the estate aswe pleased, and I am strongly against devising it to ChillinglyGordon.  It may be a crotchet of mine, but one which I think youshare, that the owner of English soil should have a son's love for thenative land, and Gordon will never have that.  I think, too, that itwill be best for his own career, and for the establishment of a frankunderstanding between us and himself, that he should be fairly toldthat he would not be benefited in the event of our death.  Twentythousand pounds given to him now would be a greater boon to him thanten times the sum twenty years later.  With that at his command, hecan enter Parliament, and have an income, added to what he nowpossesses, if modest, still sufficient to make him independent of aminister's patronage.Pray humour me, my dearest father, in the proposition I venture tosubmit to you.     Your affectionate son,  KENELM.FROM SIR PETER CHILLINGLY TO KENELM CHILLINGLY.MY DEAR BOY,--You are not worthy to be a Chillingly; you are decidedlywarm-blooded: never was a load lifted off a man's mind with a gentlerhand.  Yes, I have wished to cut off the entail and resettle theproperty; but, as it was eminently to my advantage to do so, I shrankfrom asking it, though eventually it would be almost as much to yourown advantage.  What with the purchase I made of the Faircleuchlands--which I could only effect by money borrowed at high interest onmy personal security, and paid off by yearly instalments, eatinglargely into income--and the old mortgages, etc., I own I have beenpinched of late years.  But what rejoices me the most is the power tomake homes for our honest labourers more comfortable, and nearer totheir work, which last is the chief point, for the old cottages inthemselves are not bad; the misfortune is, when you build an extraroom for the children, the silly people let it out to a lodger.My dear boy, I am very much touched by your wish to increase yourmother's jointure,--a very proper wish, independently of filialfeeling, for she brought to the estate a very pretty fortune, which,the trustees consented to my investing in land; and though the landcompleted our ring-fence, it does not bring in two per cent, and theconditions of the entail limited the right of jointure to an amountbelow that which a widowed Lady Chillingly may fairly expect.I care more about the provision on these points than I do for theinterests of old Chillingly Gordon's son.  I had meant to behave veryhandsomely to the father; and when the return for behaving handsomelyis being put into Chancery--A Worm Will Turn.  Nevertheless, I agreewith you that a son should not be punished for his father's faults;and, if the sacrifice of L20,000 makes you and myself feel that we arebetter Christians and truer gentlemen, we shall buy that feeling verycheaply.Sir Peter then proceeded, half jestingly, half seriously, to combatKenelm's declaration that he was not in love with Cecilia Travers;and, urging the advantages of marriage with one whom Kenelm allowedwould be a perfect wife, astutely remarked that unless Kenelm had ason of his own it did not seem to him quite just to the next of kin towill the property from him, upon no better plea than the want of lovefor his native country.  "He would love his country fast enough if hehad 10,000 acres in it."Kenelm shook his head when he came to this sentence."Is even then love for one's country but cupboard-love after all?"said he; and he postponed finishing the perusal of his father'sletter.CHAPTER VII.KENELM CHILLINGLY did not exaggerate the social position he hadacquired when he classed himself amongst the lions of the fashionableworld.  I dare not count the number of three-cornered notes showeredupon him by the fine ladies who grow romantic upon any kind ofcelebrity; or the carefully sealed envelopes, containing letters fromfair Anonymas, who asked if he had a heart, and would be in such aplace in the Park at such an hour.  What there was in KenelmChillingly that should make him thus favoured, especially by the fairsex, it would be difficult to say, unless it was the two-foldreputation of being unlike other people, and of being unaffectedlyindifferent to the gain of any reputation at all.  He might, had he sopleased, have easily established a proof that the prevalent thoughvague belief in his talents was not altogether unjustified.  For thearticles he had sent from abroad to "The Londoner" and by which histravelling expenses were defrayed, had been stamped by that sort oforiginality in tone and treatment which rarely fails to excitecuriosity as to the author, and meets with more general praise thanperhaps it deserves.But Mivers was true to his contract to preserve inviolable theincognito of the author, and Kenelm regarded with profound contemptthe articles themselves and the readers who praised them.Just as misanthropy with some persons grows out of benevolencedisappointed, so there are certain natures--and Kenelm Chillingly'swas perhaps one of them--in which indifferentism grows out ofearnestness baffled.He had promised himself pleasure in renewing acquaintance with his oldtutor, Mr. Welby,--pleasure in refreshing his own taste formetaphysics and casuistry and criticism.  But that accomplishedprofessor of realism had retired from philosophy altogether, and wasnow enjoying a holiday for life in the business of a public office.  Aminister in favour of whom, when in opposition, Mr. Welby, in a momentof whim, wrote some very able articles in a leading journal, had, onacceding to power, presented the realist with one of those few goodthings still left to ministerial patronage,--a place worth aboutL1,200 a year.  His mornings thus engaged in routine work, Mr. Welbyenjoyed his evenings in a convivial way."/Inveni portum/," he said to Kenelm; "I plunge into no troubledwaters now.  But come and dine with me to-morrow, tete-a-tete.  Mywife is at St. Leonard's with my youngest born for the benefit ofsea-air."  Kenelm accepted the invitation.The dinner would have contented a Brillat-Savarin: it was faultless;and the claret was that rare nectar, the Lafitte of 1848."I never share this," said Welby, "with more than one friend at atime."Kenelm sought to engage his host in discussion on certain new works invogue, and which were composed according to purely realistic canons ofcriticism.  "The more realistic; these books pretend to be, the lessreal they are," said Kenelm.  "I am half inclined to think that thewhole school you so systematically sought to build up is a mistake,and that realism in art is a thing impossible.""I dare say you are right.  I took up that school in earnest because Iwas in a passion with pretenders to the Idealistic school; andwhatever one takes up in earnest is generally a mistake, especially ifone is in a passion.  I was not in earnest and I was not in a passionwhen I wrote those articles to which I am indebted for my office."Mr. Welby here luxuriously stretched his limbs, and lifting his glassto his lips, voluptuously inhaled its bouquet."You sadden me," returned Kenelm.  "It is a melancholy thing to findthat one's mind was influenced in youth by a teacher who mocks at hisown teachings."Welby shrugged his shoulders.  "Life consists in the alternate processof learning and unlearning; but it is often wiser to unlearn than tolearn.  For the rest, as I have ceased to be a critic, I care littlewhether I was wrong or right when I played that part.  I think I amright now as a placeman.  Let the world go its own way, provided theworld lets you live upon it.  I drain my wine to the lees, and cutdown hope to the brief span of life.  Reject realism in art if youplease, and accept realism in conduct.  For the first time in my lifeI am comfortable: my mind, having worn out its walking-shoes, is nowenjoying the luxury of slippers.  Who can deny the realism ofcomfort?""Has a man a right," Kenelm said to himself, as he entered hisbrougham, "to employ all the brilliancy of a rare wit, all theacquisitions of as rare a scholarship, to the scaring of the younggeneration out of the safe old roads which youth left to itself wouldtake,--old roads skirted by romantic rivers and bowery trees,--directing them into new paths on long sandy flats, and then,when they are faint and footsore, to tell them that he cares not a pinwhether they have worn out their shoes in right paths or wrong paths,for that he has attained the /summum bonum/ of philosophy in thecomfort of easy slippers?"Before he could answer the question he thus put to himself, hisbrougham stopped at the door of the minister whom Welby hadcontributed to bring into power.That night there was a crowded muster of the fashionable world at thegreat man's house.  It happened to be a very critical moment for theminister.  The fate of his cabinet depended on the result of a motionabout to be made the following week in the House of Commons.  Thegreat man stood at the entrance of the apartments to receive hisguests, and among the guests were the framers of the hostile motionand the leaders of the opposition.  His smile was not less gracious tothem than to his dearest friends and stanchest supporters."I suppose this is realism," said Kenelm to himself; "but it is nottruth, and it is not comfort."  Leaning against the wall near thedoorway, he contemplated with grave interest the striking countenanceof his distinguished host.  He detected beneath that courteous smileand that urbane manner the signs of care.  The eye was absent, thecheek pinched, the brow furrowed.  Kenelm turned away his looks, andglanced over the animated countenances of the idle loungers alongcommoner thoroughfares in life.  Their eyes were not absent; theirbrows were not furrowed; their minds seemed quite at home inexchanging nothings.  Interest many of them had in the approachingstruggle, but it was much such an interest as betters of small sumsmay have on the Derby day,--just enough to give piquancy to the race;nothing to make gain a great joy, or loss a keen anguish."Our host is looking ill," said Mivers, accosting Kenelm.  "I detectsymptoms of suppressed gout.  You know my aphorism, 'nothing so goutyas ambition,' especially Parliamentary ambition.""You are not one of those friends who press on my choice of life thatsource of disease; allow me to thank you.""Your thanks are misplaced.  I strongly advise you to devote yourselfto a political career.""Despite the gout?""Despite the gout.  If you could take the world as I do, my advicemight be different.  But your mind is overcrowded with doubts andfantasies and crotchets, and you have no choice but to give them ventin active life.""You had something to do in making me what I am,--an idler; somethingto answer for as to my doubts, fantasies, and crotchets.  It was byyour recommendation that I was placed under the tuition of Mr. Welby,and at that critical age in which the bent of the twig forms the shapeof the tree.""And I pride myself on that counsel.  I repeat the reasons for which Igave it: it is an incalculable advantage for a young man to start inlife thoroughly initiated into the New Ideas which will more or lessinfluence his generation.  Welby was the ablest representative ofthese ideas.  It is a wondrous good fortune when the propagandist ofthe New Ideas is something more than a bookish philosopher,--when heis a thorough 'man of the world,' and is what we emphatically call'practical.'  Yes, you owe me much that I secured to you such tuition,and saved you from twaddle and sentiment, the poetry of Wordsworth andthe muscular Christianity of Cousin John.""What you say that you saved me from might have done me more good thanall you conferred on me.  I suspect that when education succeeds inplacing an old head upon young shoulders the combination is nothealthful: it clogs the blood and slackens the pulse.  However, I mustnot be ungrateful; you meant kindly.  Yes, I suppose Welby ispractical: he has no belief, and he has got a place.  But our host, Ipresume, is also practical; his place is a much higher one thanWelby's, and yet he is surely not without belief?""He was born before the new ideas came into practical force; but inproportion as they have done so, his beliefs have necessarilydisappeared.  I don't suppose that he believes in much now, except thetwo propositions: firstly, that if he accept the new ideas he willhave power and keep it, and if he does not accept them power is out ofthe question; and, secondly, that if the new ideas are to prevail heis the best man to direct them safely,--beliefs quite enough for aminister.  No wise minister should have more.""Does he not believe that the motion he is to resist next week is abad one?""A bad one of course, in its consequences, for if it succeed it willupset him; a good one in itself I am sure he must think it, for hewould bring it on himself if he were in opposition.""I see that Pope's definition is still true, 'Party is the madness ofthe many for the gain of the few.'""No, it is not true.  Madness is a wrong word applied to the many: themany are sane enough; they know their own objects, and they make useof the intellect of the few in order to gain their objects.  In eachparty it is the many that control the few who nominally lead them.  Aman becomes Prime Minister because he seems to the many of his partythe fittest person to carry out their views.  If he presume to differfrom these views, they put him into a moral pillory, and pelt him withtheir dirtiest stones and their rottenest eggs.""Then the maxim should be reversed, and party is rather the madness ofthe few for the gain of the many?"Of the two, that is the more correct definition.""Let me keep my senses and decline to be one of the few."Kenelm moved away from his cousin's side, and entering one of the lesscrowded rooms, saw Cecilia Travers seated there in a recess with LadyGlenalvon.  He joined them, and after a brief interchange of a fewcommonplaces, Lady Glenalvon quitted her post to accost a foreignambassadress, and Kenelm sank into the chair she vacated.It was a relief to his eye to contemplate Cecilia's candid brow; tohis ear to hearken to the soft voice that had no artificial tones, anduttered no cynical witticisms."Don't you think it strange," said Kenelm, "that we English should somould all our habits as to make even what we call pleasure as littlepleasurable as possible?  We are now in the beginning of June, thefresh outburst of summer, when every day in the country is a delightto eye and ear, and we say, 'The season for hot rooms is beginning.'We alone of civilized races spend our summer in a capital, and clingto the country when the trees are leafless and the brooks frozen.""Certainly that is a mistake; but I love the country in all seasons,even in winter.""Provided the country house is full of London people?""No; that is rather a drawback.  I never want companions in thecountry.""True; I should have remembered that you differ from young ladies ingeneral, and make companions of books.  They are always moreconversable in the country than they are in town; or rather, we listenthere to them with less distracted attention.  Ha! do I not recognizeyonder the fair whiskers of George Belvoir?  Who is the lady leaningon his arm?""Don't you know?--Lady Emily Belvoir, his wife.""Ah!  I was told that he had married.  The lady is handsome.  She willbecome the family diamonds.  Does she read Blue-books?""I will ask her if you wish.""Nay, it is scarcely worth while.  During my rambles abroad I saw butfew English newspapers.  I did, however, learn that George had won hiselection.  Has he yet spoken in Parliament?""Yes; he moved the answer to the Address this session, and was muchcomplimented on the excellent tone and taste of his speech.  He spokeagain a few weeks afterwards, I fear not so successfully.""Coughed down?""Something like it.""Do him good; he will recover the cough, and fulfil my prophecy of hissuccess.""Have you done with poor George for the present?  If so, allow me toask whether you have quite forgotten Will Somers and Jessie Wiles?""Forgotten them! no.""But you have never asked after them?""I took it for granted that they were as happy as could be expected.Pray assure me that they are.""I trust so now; but they have had trouble, and have left Graveleigh.""Trouble! left Graveleigh!  You make me uneasy.  Pray explain.""They had not been three months married and installed in the home theyowed to you, when poor Will was seized with a rheumatic fever.  He wasconfined to his bed for many weeks; and, when at last he could movefrom it, was so weak as to be still unable to do any work.  During hisillness Jessie had no heart and little leisure to attend to the shop.Of course I--that is, my dear father--gave them all necessaryassistance; but--""I understand; they were reduced to objects of charity.  Brute that Iam, never to have thought of the duties I owed to the couple I hadbrought together.  But pray go on.""You are aware that just before you left us my father received aproposal to exchange his property at Graveleigh for some lands moredesirable to him?""I remember.  He closed with that offer.""Yes; Captain Stavers, the new landlord of Graveleigh, seems to be avery bad man; and though he could not turn the Somerses out of thecottage so long as they paid rent, which we took care they didpay,--yet out of a very wicked spite he set up a rival shop in one ofhis other cottages in the village, and it became impossible for thesepoor young people to get a livelihood at Graveleigh.""What excuse for spite against so harmless a young couple couldCaptain Stavers find or invent?"Cecilia looked down and coloured.  "It was a revengeful feelingagainst Jessie.""Ah, I comprehend.""But they have now left the village, and are happily settledelsewhere.  Will has recovered his health, and they are prosperingmuch more than they could ever have done at Graveleigh.""In that change you were their benefactress, Miss Travers?" saidKenelm, in a more tender voice and with a softer eye than he had everbefore evinced towards the heiress."No, it is not I whom they have to thank and bless.""Who, then, is it?  Your father?""No.  Do not question me.  I am bound not to say.  They do notthemselves know; they rather believe that their gratitude is due toyou.""To me!  Am I to be forever a sham in spite of myself?  My dear MissTravers, it is essential to my honour that I should undeceive thiscredulous pair; where can I find them?""I must not say; but I will ask permission of their concealedbenefactor, and send you their address."A touch was laid on Kenelm's arm, and a voice whispered, "May I askyou to present me to Miss Travers?""Miss Travers," said Kenelm, "I entreat you to add to the list of youracquaintances a cousin of mine,--Mr. Chillingly Gordon."While Gordon addressed to Cecilia the well-bred conventionalisms withwhich acquaintance in London drawing-rooms usually commences, Kenelm,obedient to a sign from Lady Glenalvon, who had just re-entered theroom, quitted his seat, and joined the marchioness."Is not that young man whom you left talking with Miss Travers yourclever cousin Gordon?""The same.""She is listening to him with great attention.  How his face brightensup as he talks!  He is positively handsome, thus animated.""Yes, I could fancy him a dangerous wooer.  He has wit and livelinessand audacity; he could be very much in love with a great fortune, andtalk to the owner of it with a fervour rarely exhibited by aChillingly.  Well, it is no affair of mine.""It ought to be."Alas and alas! that "ought to be;" what depths of sorrowful meaninglie within that simple phrase!  How happy would be our lives, howgrand our actions, how pure our souls, if all could be with us as itought to be!CHAPTER VIII.WE often form cordial intimacies in the confined society of a countryhouse, or a quiet watering-place, or a small Continental town, whichfade away into remote acquaintanceship in the mighty vortex of Londonlife, neither party being to blame for the estrangement.  It was sowith Leopold Travers and Kenelm Chillingly.  Travers, as we have seen,had felt a powerful charm in the converse of the young stranger, so incontrast with the routine of the rural companionships to which hisalert intellect had for many years circumscribed its range.  But onreappearing in London the season before Kenelm again met him, he hadrenewed old friendships with men of his own standing,--officers in theregiment of which he had once been a popular ornament, some of themstill unmarried, a few of them like himself widowed, others who hadbeen his rivals in fashion, and were still pleasant idlers about town;and it rarely happens in a metropolis that we have intimatefriendships with those of another generation, unless there be somecommon tie in the cultivation of art and letters, or the action ofkindred sympathies in the party strife of politics.  Therefore Traversand Kenelm had had little familiar communication with each other sincethey first met at the Beaumanoirs'.  Now and then they foundthemselves at the same crowded assemblies, and interchanged nods andsalutations.  But their habits were different; the houses at whichthey were intimate were not the same, neither did they frequent thesame clubs.  Kenelm's chief bodily exercise was still that of long andearly rambles into rural suburbs; Leopold's was that of a late ride inthe Row.  Of the two, Leopold was much more the man of pleasure.  Oncerestored to metropolitan life, a temper constitutionally eager,ardent, and convivial took kindly, as in earlier youth, to its lightrange of enjoyments.Had the intercourse between the two men been as frankly familiar as ithad been at Neesdale Park, Kenelm would probably have seen much moreof Cecilia at her own home; and the admiration and esteem with whichshe already inspired him might have ripened into much warmer feeling,had he thus been brought into clearer comprehension of the soft andwomanly heart, and its tender predisposition towards himself.He had said somewhat vaguely in his letter to Sir Peter, that"sometimes he felt as if his indifference to love, as to ambition, wasbecause he had some impossible ideal in each."  Taking that conjectureto task, he could not honestly persuade himself that he had formed anyideal of woman and wife with which the reality of Cecilia Travers wasat war.  On the contrary, the more he thought over the characteristicsof Cecilia, the more they seemed to correspond to any ideal that hadfloated before him in the twilight of dreamy revery; and yet he knewthat he was not in love with her, that his heart did not respond tohis reason; and mournfully he resigned himself to the conviction thatnowhere in this planet, from the normal pursuits of whose inhabitantshe felt so estranged, was there waiting for him the smiling playmate,the earnest helpmate.  As this conviction strengthened, so anincreased weariness of the artificial life of the metropolis, and ofall its objects and amusements, turned his thoughts with an intenseyearning towards the Bohemian freedom and fresh excitements of hisfoot ramblings.  He often thought with envy of the wandering minstrel,and wondered whether, if he again traversed the same range of country,he might encounter again that vagrant singer.CHAPTER IX.IT is nearly a week since Kenelm had met Cecilia, and he is sitting inhis rooms with Lord Thetford at that hour of three in the afternoonwhich is found the most difficult to dispose of by idlers about town.Amongst young men of his own age and class with whom Kenelm assortedin the fashionable world, perhaps the one whom he liked the best, andof whom he saw the most, was this young heir of the Beaumanoirs; andthough Lord Thetford has nothing to do with the direct stream of mystory, it is worth pausing a few minutes to sketch an outline of oneof the best whom the last generation has produced for a part that,owing to accidents of birth and fortune, young men like Lord Thetfordmust play on that stage from which the curtain is not yet drawn up.Destined to be the head of a family that unites with princelypossessions and a historical name a keen though honourable ambitionfor political power, Lord Thetford has been care fully educated,especially in the new ideas of his time.  His father, though a man ofno ordinary talents, has never taken a prominent part in public life.He desires his eldest son to do so.  The Beaumanoirs have been Whigsfrom the time of William III.  They have shared the good and the illfortunes of a party which, whether we side with it or not, nopolitician who dreads extremes in the government of a State sopre-eminently artificial that a prevalent extreme at either end of thebalance would be fatal to equilibrium, can desire to become extinct orfeeble so long as a constitutional monarchy exists in England.  Fromthe reign of George I. to the death of George IV., the Beaumanoirswere in the ascendant.  Visit their family portrait gallery, and youmust admire the eminence of a house which, during that interval ofless than a century, contributed so many men to the service of theState or the adornment of the Court,--so many Ministers, Ambassadors,Generals, Lord Chamberlains, and Masters of the Horse.  When theyounger Pitt beat the great Whig Houses, the Beaumanoirs vanish intocomparative obscurity; they reemerge with the accession of WilliamIV., and once more produce bulwarks of the State and ornaments of theCrown.  The present Lord of Beaumanoir, /poco curante/ in politicsthough he be, has at least held high offices at Court; and, as amatter of course, he is Lord Lieutenant of his county, as well asKnight of the Garter.  He is a man whom the chiefs of his party havebeen accustomed to consult on critical questions.  He gives hisopinions confidentially and modestly, and when they are rejected nevertakes offence.  He thinks that a time is coming when the head of theBeaumanoirs should descend into the lists and fight hand-to-hand withany Hodge or Hobson in the cause of his country for the benefit of theWhigs.  Too lazy or too old to do this himself, he says to his son,"You must do it: without effort of mine the thing may last my life.It needs effort of yours that the thing may last through your own."Lord Thetford cheerfully responds to the paternal admonition.  Hecurbs his natural inclinations, which are neither inelegant norunmanly; for, on the one side, he is very fond of music and painting,an accomplished amateur, and deemed a sound connoisseur in both; and,on the other side, he has a passion for all field sports, andespecially for hunting.  He allows no such attractions to interferewith diligent attention to the business of the House of Commons.  Heserves in Committees, he takes the chair at public meetings onsanitary questions or projects for social improvement, and acquitshimself well therein.  He has not yet spoken in debate, but he hasonly been two years in Parliament, and he takes his father's wiseadvice not to speak till the third.  But he is not without weightamong the well-born youth of the party, and has in him the stuff outof which, when it becomes seasoned, the Corinthian capitals of aCabinet may be very effectively carved.  In his own heart he isconvinced that his party are going too far and too fast; but with thatparty he goes on light-heartedly, and would continue to do so if theywent to Erebus.  But he would prefer their going the other way.  Forthe rest, a pleasant, bright-eyed young fellow, with vivid animalspirits; and, in the holiday moments of reprieve from public duty hebrings sunshine into draggling hunting-fields, and a fresh breeze intoheated ballrooms."My dear fellow," said Lord Thetford, as he threw aside his cigar, "Iquite understand that you bore yourself: you have nothing else to do.""What can I do?""Work.""Work!""Yes, you are clever enough to feel that you have a mind; and mind isa restless inmate of body: it craves occupation of some sort, andregular occupation too; it needs its daily constitutional exercise.Do you give your mind that?""I am sure I don't know, but my mind is always busying itself aboutsomething or other.""In a desultory way,--with no fixed object.""True.""Write a book, and then it will have its constitutional.""Nay, my mind is always writing a book (though it may not publishone), always jotting down impressions, or inventing incidents, orinvestigating characters; and between you and me, I do not think thatI do bore myself so much as I did formerly.  Other people bore me morethan they did.""Because you will not create an object in common with other people:come into Parliament, side with a party, and you have that object.""Do you mean seriously to tell me that you are not bored in the Houseof Commons?""With the speakers very often, yes; but with the strife between thespeakers, no.  The House of Commons life has a peculiar excitementscarcely understood out of it; but you may conceive its charm when youobserve that a man who has once been in the thick of it feels forlornand shelved if he lose his seat, and even repines when the accident ofbirth transfers him to the serener air of the Upper House.  Try thatlife, Chillingly.""I might if I were an ultra-Radical, a Republican, a Communist, aSocialist, and wished to upset everything existing, for then thestrife would at least be a very earnest one.""But could not you be equally in earnest against those revolutionarygentlemen?""Are you and your leaders in earnest against them?  They don't appearto me so."Thetford was silent for a minute.  "Well, if you doubt the principlesof my side, go with the other side.  For my part, I and many of ourparty would be glad to see the Conservatives stronger.""I have no doubt they would.  No sensible man likes to be carried offhis legs by the rush of the crowd behind him; and a crowd is lessheadlong when it sees a strong force arrayed against it in front.  Butit seems to me that, at present, Conservatism can but be what it nowis,--a party that may combine for resistance, and will not combine forinventive construction.  We are living in an age in which the processof unsettlement is going blindly at work, as if impelled by a Nemesisas blind as itself.  New ideas come beating into surf and surgeagainst those which former reasoners had considered as fixed banks andbreakwaters; and the new ideas are so mutable, so fickle, that thosewhich were considered novel ten years ago are deemed obsolete to-day,and the new ones of to-day will in their turn be obsolete to-morrow.And, in a sort of fatalism, you see statesmen yielding way to thesesuccessive mockeries of experiment,--for they are experiments againstexperience,--and saying to each other with a shrug of the shoulders,'Bismillah! it must be so; the country will have it, even though itsends the country to the dogs.'  I don't feel sure that the countrywill not go there the sooner, if you can only strengthen theConservative element enough to set it up in office, with the certaintyof knocking it down again.  Alas!  I am too dispassionate a looker-onto be fit for a partisan: would I were not!  Address yourself to mycousin Gordon.""Ay, Chillingly Gordon is a coming man, and has all the earnestnessyou find absent in party and in yourself.""You call him earnest?""Thoroughly, in the pursuit of one object,--the advancement ofChillingly Gordon.  If he get into the House of Commons, and succeedthere, I hope he will never become my leader; for if he thoughtChristianity in the way of his promotion, he would bring in a bill forits abolition.""In that case would he still be your leader?""My dear Kenelm, you don't know what is the spirit of party, and howeasily it makes excuses for any act of its leader.  Of course, ifGordon brought in a bill for the abolition of Christianity, it wouldbe on the plea that the abolition was good for the Christians, and hisfollowers would cheer that enlightened sentiment.""Ah," said Kenelm, with a sigh, "I own myself the dullest ofblockheads; for instead of tempting me into the field of partypolitics, your talk leaves me in stolid amaze that you do not take toyour heels, where honour can only be saved by flight.""Pooh! my dear Chillingly, we cannot run away from the age in which welive: we must accept its conditions and make the best of them; and ifthe House of Commons be nothing else, it is a famous debating societyand a capital club.  Think over it.  I must leave you now.  I am goingto see a picture at the Exhibition which has been most truculentlycriticised in 'The Londoner,' but which I am assured, on goodauthority, is a work of remarkable merit.  I can't bear to see a mansnarled and sneered down, no doubt by jealous rivals, who have theirinfluence in journals, so I shall judge of the picture for myself.  Ifit be really as good as I am told, I shall talk about it to everybodyI meet; and in matters of art I fancy my word goes for something.Study art, my dear Kenelm.  No gentleman's education is complete if hedoes n't know a good picture from a bad one.  After the Exhibition Ishall just have time for a canter round the Park before the debate ofthe session, which begins to-night."With a light step the young man quitted the room, humming an air fromthe "Figaro" as he descended the stairs.  From the window Kenelmwatched him swinging himself with careless grace into his saddle andriding briskly down the street,--in form and face and bearing a verymodel of young, high-born, high-bred manhood.  "The Venetians,"muttered Kenelm, "decapitated Marino Faliero for conspiring againsthis own order,--the nobles.  The Venetians loved their institutions,and had faith in them.  Is there such love and such faith among theEnglish?"As he thus soliloquized he heard a shrilling sort of squeak; and ashowman stationed before his window the stage on which Punch satirizesthe laws and moralities of the world, "kills the beadle and defies thedevil."CHAPTER X.KENELM turned from the sight of Punch and Punch's friend the cur, ashis servant, entering, said a person from the country, who would notgive his name, asked to see him.Thinking it might be some message from his father, Kenelm ordered thestranger to be admitted, and in another minute there entered a youngman of handsome countenance and powerful frame, in whom, after asurprised stare, Kenelm recognized Tom Bowles.  Difficult indeed wouldhave been that recognition to an unobservant beholder: no trace wasleft of the sullen bully or the village farrier; the expression of theface was mild and intelligent,--more bashful than hardy; the brutestrength of the form had lost its former clumsiness, the simple dresswas that of a gentleman,--to use an expressive idiom, the whole manwas wonderfully "toned down.""I am afraid, sir, I am taking a liberty," said Tom, rather nervously,twiddling his hat between his fingers."I should be a greater friend to liberty than I am if it were alwaystaken in the same way," said Kenelm, with a touch of his saturninehumour; but then yielding at once to the warmer impulse of his nature,he grasped his old antagonist's hand and exclaimed, "My dear Tom, youare so welcome.  I am so glad to see you.  Sit down, man; sit down:make yourself at home.""I did not know you were back in England, sir, till within the lastfew days; for you did say that when you came back I should see or hearfrom you," and there was a tone of reproach in the last words."I am to blame, forgive me," said Kenelm, remorsefully.  But how didyou find me out? you did not then, I think, even know my name.  That,however, it was easy enough to discover; but who gave you my addressin this lodging?""Well, sir, it was Miss Travers; and she bade me come to you.Otherwise, as you did not send for me, it was scarcely my place tocall uninvited.""But, my dear Tom, I never dreamed that you were in London.  One don'task a man whom one supposes to be more than a hundred miles off to payone an afternoon call.  You are still with your uncle, I presume? andI need not ask if all thrives well with you: you look a prosperousman, every inch of you, from crown to toe.""Yes," said Tom; "thank you kindly, sir, I am doing well in the way ofbusiness, and my uncle is to give me up the whole concern atChristmas."While Tom thus spoke Kenelm had summoned his servant, and ordered upsuch refreshments as could be found in the larder of a bachelor inlodgings.  "And what brings you to town, Tom?""Miss Travers wrote to me about a little business which she was goodenough to manage for me, and said you wished to know about it; and so,after turning it over in my mind for a few days, I resolved to come totown: indeed," added Tom, heartily, "I did wish to see your faceagain.""But you talk riddles.  What business of yours could Miss Traversimagine I wished to know about?"Tom coloured high, and looked very embarrassed.  Luckily, the servanthere entering with the refreshment-tray allowed him time to recoverhimself.  Kenelm helped him to a liberal slice of cold pigeon-pie,pressed wine on him, and did not renew the subject till he thought hisguest's tongue was likely to be more freely set loose; then he said,laying a friendly hand on Tom's shoulders, "I have been thinking overwhat passed between me and Miss Travers.  I wished to have the newaddress of Will Somers; she promised to write to his benefactor to askpermission to give it.  You are that benefactor?""Don't say benefactor, sir.  I will tell how it came about if you willlet me.  You see, I sold my little place at Graveleigh to the newSquire, and when Mother removed to Luscombe to be near me, she told mehow poor Jessie had been annoyed by Captain Stavers, who seems tothink his purchase included the young women on the property along withthe standing timber; and I was half afraid that she had given somecause for his persecution, for you know she has a blink of those softeyes of hers that might charm a wise man out of his skin and put afool there instead.""But I hope she has done with those blinks since her marriage.""Well, and I honestly think she has.  It is certain she did notencourage Captain Stavers, for I went over to Graveleigh myself on thesly, and lodged concealed with one of the cottagers who owed me akindness; and one day, as I was at watch, I saw the Captain peeringover the stile which divides Holmwood from the glebe,--you rememberHolmwood?""I can't say I do.""The footway from the village to Squire Travers's goes through thewood, which is a few hundred yards at the back of Will Somers'sorchard.  Presently the Captain drew himself suddenly back from thestile, and disappeared among the trees, and then I saw Jessie comingfrom the orchard with a basket over her arm, and walking quick towardsthe wood.  Then, sir, my heart sank.  I felt sure she was going tomeet the Captain.  However, I crept along the hedgerow, hiding myself,and got into the wood almost as soon as Jessie got there, by anotherway.  Under the cover of the brushwood I stole on till I saw theCaptain come out from the copse on the other side of the path, andplant himself just before Jessie.  Then I saw at once I had wrongedher.  She had not expected to see him, for she hastily turned back,and began to run homeward; but he caught her up, and seized her by thearm.  I could not hear what he said, but I heard her voice quite sharpwith fright and anger.  And then he suddenly seized her round thewaist, and she screamed, and I sprang forward--""And thrashed the Captain?""No, I did not," said Tom; "I had made a vow to myself that I neverwould be violent again if I could help it.  So I took him with onehand by the cuff of the neck, and with the other by the waistband, andjust pitched him on a bramble bush,--quite mildly.  He soon pickedhimself up, for he is a dapper little chap, and became very blusteringand abusive.  But I kept my temper, and said civilly, 'Littlegentleman, hard words break no bones; but if ever you molest Mrs.Somers again, I will carry you into her orchard, souse you into theduck-pond there, and call all the villagers to see you scramble out ofit again; and I will do it now if you are not off.  I dare say youhave heard of my name: I am Tom Bowles.'  Upon that his face, whichwas before very red, grew very white, and muttering something I didnot hear, he walked away."Jessie--I mean Mrs. Somers--seemed at first as much frightened at meas she had been at the Captain; and though I offered to walk with herto Miss Travers's, where she was going with a basket which the younglady had ordered, she refused, and went back home.  I felt hurt, andreturned to my uncle's the same evening; and it was not for monthsthat I heard the Captain had been spiteful enough to set up anopposition shop, and that poor Will had been taken ill, and his wifewas confined about the same time, and the talk was that they were indistress and might have to be sold up."When I heard all this, I thought that after all it was my roughtongue that had so angered the Captain and been the cause of hisspite, and so it was my duty to make it up to poor Will and his wife.I did not know how to set about mending matters, but I thought I'd goand talk to Miss Travers; and if ever there was a kind heart in agirl's breast, hers is one.""You are right there, I guess.  What did Miss Travers say?""Nay; I hardly know what she did say, but she set me thinking, and itstruck me that Jessie--Mrs. Somers--had better move to a distance, andout of the Captain's reach, and that Will would do better in a lessout-of-the-way place.  And then, by good luck, I read in the newspaperthat a stationary and a fancywork business, with a circulatinglibrary, was to be sold on moderate terms at Moleswich, the other sideof London.  So I took the train and went to the place, and thought theshop would just suit these young folks, and not be too much work foreither; then I went to Miss Travers, and I had a lot of money lying byme from the sale of the old forge and premises, which I did not knowwhat to do with; and so, to cut short a long story, I bought thebusiness, and Will and his wife are settled at Moleswich, thriving andhappy, I hope, sir."Tom's voice quivered at the last words, and he turned aside quickly,passing his hand over his eyes.Kenelm was greatly moved."And they don't know what you did for them?""To be sure not.  I don't think Will would have let him self bebeholden to me.  Ah! the lad has a spirit of his own, and Jessie--Mrs.Somers--would have felt pained and humbled that I should even think ofsuch a thing.  Miss Travers managed it all.  They take the money as aloan which is to be paid by instalments.  They have sent Miss Traversmore than one instalment already, so I know they are doing well.""A loan from Miss Travers?""No; Miss Travers wanted to have a share in it, but I begged her not.It made me happy to do what I did all myself; and Miss Travers feltfor me and did not press.  They perhaps think it is Squire Travers(though he is not a man who would like to say it, for fear it shouldbring applicants on him), or some other gentleman who takes aninterest in them.""I always said you were a grand fellow, Tom.  But you are granderstill than I thought you.""If there be any good in me, I owe it to you, sir.  Think what adrunken, violent brute I was when I first met you.  Those walks withyou, and I may say that other gentleman's talk, and then that longkind letter I had from you, not signed in your name, and written fromabroad,--all these changed me, as the child is changed at nurse.""You have evidently read a good deal since we parted.""Yes; I belong to our young men's library and institute; and when ofan evening I get hold of a book, especially a pleasant story-book, Idon't care for other company.""Have you never seen any other girl you could care for, and wish tomarry?""Ah, sir," answered Tom, "a man does not go so mad for a girl as I didfor Jessie Wiles, and when it is all over, and he has come to hissenses, put his heart into joint again as easily as if it were only abroken leg.  I don't say that I may not live to love and to marryanother woman: it is my wish to do so.  But I know that I shall loveJessie to my dying day; but not sinfully, sir,--not sinfully.  I wouldnot wrong her by a thought."There was a long pause.At last Kenelm said, "You promised to be kind to that little girl withthe flower-ball; what has become of her?""She is quite well, thank you, sir.  My aunt has taken a great fancyto her, and so has my mother.  She comes to them very often of anevening, and brings her work with her.  A quick, intelligent littlething, and full of pretty thoughts.  On Sundays, if the weather isfine, we stroll out together in the fields.""She has been a comfort to you, Tom.""Oh, yes.""And loves you?""I am sure she does; an affectionate, grateful child.""She will be a woman soon, Tom, and may love you as a woman then."Tom looked indignant and rather scornful at that suggestion, andhastened to revert to the subject more immediately at his heart."Miss Travers said you would like to call on Will Somers and his wife;will you?  Moleswich is not far from London, you know.""Certainly, I will call.""I do hope you will find them happy; and if so, perhaps you willkindly let me know; and--and--I wonder whether Jessie's child is likeher?  It is a boy; somehow or other I would rather it had been agirl.""I will write you full particulars.  But why not come with me?""No, I don't think I could do that, just at present.  It unsettled mesadly when I did again see her sweet face at Graveleigh, and she wasstill afraid of me too! that was a sharp pang.""She ought to know what you have done for her, and will.""On no account, sir; promise me that.  I should feel mean if I humbledthem,--that way.""I understand, though I will not as yet make you any positive promise.Meanwhile, if you are staying in town, lodge with me; my landlady canfind you a room.""Thank you heartily, sir; but I go back by the evening train; and,bless me! how late it is now!  I must wish you good-by.  I have somecommissions to do for my aunt, and I must buy a new doll for Susey.""Susey is the name of the little girl with the flower-ball?""Yes.  I must run off now; I feel quite light at heart seeing youagain and finding that you receive me still so kindly, as if we wereequals.""Ah, Tom, I wish I was your equal,--nay, half as noble as Heaven hasmade you!"Tom laughed incredulously, and went his way."This mischievous passion of love," said Kenelm to himself, "has itsgood side, it seems, after all.  If it was nearly making a wild beastof that brave fellow,--nay, worse than wild beast, a homicide doomedto the gibbet,--so, on the other hand, what a refined, delicate,chivalrous nature of gentleman it has developed out of the stormyelements of its first madness!

D.W.]A WOODLAND QUEEN('Reine des Bois')By ANDRE THEURIETBOOK 3.CHAPTER VIITHE STRANGE, DARK SECRETJulien had once entertained the hope that Claudet's marriage with Reinewould act as a kind of heroic remedy for the cure of his unfortunatepassion, he very soon perceived that he had been wofully mistaken.  Assoon as he had informed the grand chasserot of the success of hisundertaking, he became aware that his own burden was considerablyheavier.  Certainly it had been easier for him to bear uncertainty thanthe boisterous rapture evinced by his fortunate rival.  His jealousy roseagainst it, and that was all.  Now that he had torn from Reine the avowalof her love for Claudet, he was more than ever oppressed by his hopelesspassion, and plunged into a condition of complete moral and physicaldisintegration.  It mingled with his blood, his nerves, his thoughts, andpossessed him altogether, dwelling within him like an adored andtyrannical mistress.  Reine appeared constantly before him as he hadcontemplated her on the outside steps of the farmhouse, in her never-to-be-forgotten negligee of the short skirt and the half-open bodice.  Heagain beheld the silken treasure of her tresses, gliding playfully aroundher shoulders, the clear, honest look of her limpid eyes, the expressivesmile of her enchanting lips, and with a sudden revulsion of feeling hereflected that perhaps before a month was over, all these charms wouldbelong to Claudct.  Then, almost at the same moment, like a swallow,which, with one rapid turn of its wing, changes its course, his thoughtswent in the opposite direction, and he began to imagine what would havehappened if, instead of replying in the affirmative, Reine had objectedto marrying Claudet.  He could picture himself kneeling before her asbefore the Madonna, and in a low voice confessing his love.  He wouldhave taken her hands so respectfully, and pleaded so eloquently, that shewould have allowed herself to be convinced.  The little, hands would haveremained prisoners in his own; he would have lifted her tenderly,devotedly, in his arms, and under the influence of this feverish dream,he fancied he could feel the beating heart of the young girl against hisown bosom.  Suddenly he would wake up out of his illusions, and bite hislips with rage on finding himself in the dull reality of his owndwelling.One day he heard footsteps on the gravel; a sonorous and jovial voice methis ear.  It was Claudet, starting for La Thuiliere.  Julien bent forwardto see him, and ground his teeth as he watched his joyous departure.  Thesharp sting of jealousy entered his soul, and he rebelled against theevident injustice of Fate.  How had he deserved that life should presentso dismal and forbidding an aspect to him?  He had had none of the joysof infancy; his youth had been spent wearily under the peevish disciplineof a cloister; he had entered on his young manhood with all theawkwardness and timidity of a night-bird that is made to fly in the day.Up to the age of twenty-seven years, he had known neither love norfriendship; his time had been given entirely to earning his daily bread,and to the cultivation of religious exercises, which consoled him in somemeasure for his apparently useless way of living.  Latterly, it is true,Fortune had seemed to smile upon him, by giving him a little more moneyand liberty, but this smile was a mere mockery, and a snare more hurtfulthan the pettinesses and privations of his past life.  The ficklegoddess, continuing her part of mystifier, had opened to his enrapturedsight a magic window through which she had shown him a charming vision ofpossible happiness; but while he was still gazing, she had closed itabruptly in his face, laughing scornfully at his discomfiture.  Whatsense was there in this perversion of justice, this perpetual mockery ofFate?  At times the influence of his early education would resume itssway, and he would ask himself whether all this apparent contradictionwere not a secret admonition from on high, warning him that he had notbeen created to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of this world, and ought,therefore, to turn his attention toward things eternal, and renounce theperishable delights of the flesh?"If so," thought he, irreverently, "the warning comes rather late, and itwould have answered the purpose better had I been allowed to continue inthe narrow way of obscure poverty!"  Now that the enervating influence ofa more prosperous atmosphere had weakened his courage, and cooled theardor of his piety, his faith began to totter like an old wall.  Hisreligious beliefs seemed to have been wrecked by the same storm which haddestroyed his passionate hopes of love, and left him stranded and forlornwithout either haven or pilot, blown hither and thither solely by theviolence of his passion.By degrees he took an aversion to his home, and would spend entire daysin the woods.  Their secluded haunts, already colored by the breath ofautumn, became more attractive to him as other refuge failed him.  Theywere his consolation; his doubts, weakness, and amorous regrets, foundsympathy and indulgence under their silent shelter.  He felt less lonely,less humiliated, less prosaic among these great forest depths, theselofty ash-trees, raising their verdant branches to heaven.  He found hecould more easily evoke the seductive image of Reine Vincart in thesecalm solitudes, where the recollections of the previous springtimemingled with the phantoms of his heated imagination and clothedthemselves with almost living forms.  He seemed to see the young girlrising from the mists of the distant valleys.  The least fluttering ofthe leaves heralded her fancied approach.  At times the hallucination wasso complete that he could see, in the interlacing of the branches, theundulations of her supple form, and the graceful outlines of her profile.Then he would be seized by an insane desire to reach the fugitive andspeak to her once more, and would go tearing along the brushwood for thatpurpose.  Now and then, in the half light formed by the hanging boughs,he would see rays of golden light, coming straight down to the ground,and resting there lightly like diaphanous apparitions.  Sometimes therustling of birds taking flight, would sound in his ears like the timidfrou-frou of a skirt, and Julien, fascinated by the mysterious charm ofthese indefinite objects, and following the impulse of their mysticalsuggestions, would fling himself impetuously into the jungle, repeatingto him self the words of the "Canticle of Canticles": "I hear the voiceof my beloved; behold! she cometh leaping upon the mountains, skippingupon the hills."  He would continue to press forward in pursuit of theintangible apparition, until he sank with exhaustion near some stream orfountain.  Under the influence of the fever, which was consuming hisbrain, he would imagine the trickling water to be the song of a femininevoice.  He would wind his arms around the young saplings, he would tearthe berries from the bushes, pressing them against his thirsty lips, andimagining their odoriferous sweetness to be a fond caress from the lovedone.He would return from these expeditions exhausted but not appeased.Sometimes he would come across Claudet, also returning home from payinghis court to Reine Vincart; and the unhappy Julien would scrutinize hisrival's countenance, seeking eagerly for some trace of the impressions hehad received during the loving interview.  His curiosity was nearlyalways baffled; for Claudet seemed to have left all his gayety andconversational powers at La Thuiliere.  During their tete-a-tete meals,he hardly spoke at all, maintaining a reserved attitude and a taciturncountenance.  Julien, provoked at this unexpected sobriety, privatelyaccused his cousin of dissimulation, and of trying to conceal hishappiness.  His jealousy so blinded him that he considered the silence ofClaudet as pure hypocrisy not recognizing that it was assumed for thepurpose of concealing some unpleasantness rather than satisfaction.The fact was that Claudet, although rejoicing at the turn matters hadtaken, was verifying the poet's saying: "Never is perfect happiness ourlot."  When Julien brought him the good news, and he had flown sojoyfully to La Thuiliere, he had certainly been cordially received byReine, but, nevertheless, he had noticed with surprise an absent anddreamy look in her eyes, which did not agree with his idea of a firstinterview of lovers.  When he wished to express his affection in thevivacious and significant manner ordinarily employed among the peasantry,that is to say, by vigorous embracing and resounding kisses, he met withunexpected resistance."Keep quiet!"  was the order, "and let us talk rationally!"He obeyed, although not agreeing in her view of the reserve to bemaintained between lovers; but, he made up his mind to return to thecharge and triumph over her bashful scruples.  In fact, he began againthe very next day, and his impetuous ardor encountered the same refusalin the same firm, though affectionate manner.  He ventured to complain,telling Reine that she did not love him as she ought."If I did not feel friendly toward you," replied the young girl,laconically, "should I have allowed you to talk to me of marriage?"Then, seeing that he looked vexed and worried, and realizing that she wasperhaps treating him too roughly, she continued, more gently:"Remember, Claudet, that I am living all alone at the farm.  That obligesme to have more reserve than a girl whose mother is with her.  So youmust not be offended if I do not behave exactly as others might, and restassured that it will not prevent me from being a good wife to you, whenwe are married.""Well, now," thought Claudet, as he was returning despondently to Vivey:"I can't help thinking that a little caress now and then wouldn't hurtany one!"Under these conditions it is not to be supposed he was in a mood torelate any of the details of such meagre lovemaking.  His self-love waswounded by Reine's coldness.  Having always been "cock-of-the-walk," hecould not understand why he had such poor success with the only one aboutwhom he was in earnest.  He kept quiet, therefore, hiding his anxietyunder the mask of careless indifference.  Moreover, a certain primitiveinstinct of prudence made him circumspect.  In his innermost soul, hestill entertained doubts of Julien's sincerity.  Sometimes he doubtedwhether his cousin's conduct had not been dictated by the bitterness ofrejected love, rather than a generous impulse of affection, and he didnot care to reveal Reine's repulse to one whom he vaguely suspected ofbeing a former lover.  His simple, ardent nature could not put up withopposition, and he thought only of hastening the day when Reine wouldbelong to him altogether.  But, when he broached this subject, he had themortification to find that she was less impatient than himself."There is no hurry," she replied, "our affairs are not in order, ourharvests are not housed, and it would be better to wait till the dullseason."In his first moments of joy and effervescence, Claudet had evinced thedesire to announce immediately the betrothal throughout the village.This Reine had opposed; she thought they should avoid awakening publiccuriosity so long beforehand, and she extracted from Claudet a promise tosay nothing until the date of the marriage should be settled.  He hadunwillingly consented, and thus, during the last month, the matter hadbeen dragging on indefinitely:With Julien de Buxieres, this interminable delay, these incessant comingsand goings from the chateau to the farm, as well as the mysteriousconduct of the bridegroom-elect, became a subject of serious irritation,amounting almost to obsession.  He would have wished the affair hurriedup, and the sacrifice consummated without hindrance.  He believed thatwhen once the newly-married pair had taken up their quarters at LaThuiliere, the very certainty that Reine belonged in future to anotherwould suffice to effect a radical cure in him, and chase away thedeceptive phantoms by which he was pursued.One evening, as Claudet was returning home, more out of humor and silentthan usual, Julien asked him, abruptly:"Well! how are you getting along?  When is the wedding?""Nothing is decided yet," replied Claudet, "we have time enough!""You think so?" exclaimed de Buxieres, sarcastically; "you haveconsiderable patience for a lover!"The remark and the tone provoked Claudet."The delay is not of my making," returned he."Ah!"  replied the other, quickly, "then it comes from MademoiselleVincart?"  And a sudden gleam came into his eyes, as if Claudet'sassertion had kindled a spark of hope in his breast.  The latter noticedthe momentary brightness in his cousin's usually stormy countenance, andhastened to reply:"Nay, nay; we both think it better to postpone the wedding until theharvest is in.""You are wrong.  A wedding should not be postponed.  Besides, thisprolonged love-making, these daily visits to the farm--all that is notvery proper.  It is compromising for Mademoiselle Vincart!"Julien shot out these remarks with a degree of fierceness and violencethat astonished Claudet."You think, then," said he, "that we ought to rush matters, and have thewedding before winter?""Undoubtedly!"The next day, at La Thuiliere, the grand chasserot, as he stood in theorchard, watching Reine spread linen on the grass, entered bravely on thesubject."Reine," said he, coaxingly, "I think we shall have to decide upon a dayfor our wedding."She set down the watering-pot with which she was wetting the linen, andlooked anxiously at her betrothed."I thought we had agreed to wait until the later season.  Why do you wishto change that arrangement?""That is true; I promised not to hurry you, Reine, but it is beyond me towait--you must not be vexed with me if I find the time long.  Besides,they know nothing, around the village, of our intentions, and my cominghere every day might cause gossip and make it unpleasant for you.  At anyrate, that is the opinion of Monsieur de Buxieres, with whom I wasconferring only yesterday evening."At the name of Julien, Reine frowned and bit her lip."Aha!"  said she, "it is he who has been advising you?""Yes; he says the sooner we are married, the better it will be.""Why does he interfere in what does not concern him?"  said she, angrily,turning her head away.  She stood a moment in thought, absently pushingforward the roll of linen with her foot.  Then, shrugging her shouldersand raising her head, she said slowly, while still avoiding Claudet'seyes:"Perhaps you are right--both of you.  Well, let it be so!  I authorizeyou to go to Monsieur le Cure and arrange the day with him.""Oh, thanks, Reine!"  exclaimed Claudet, rapturously; "you make me veryhappy!"He pressed her hands in his, but though absorbed in his own joyfulfeelings, he could not help remarking that the young girl was tremblingin his grasp.  He even fancied that there was a suspicious, tearfulglitter in her brilliant eyes.He left her, however, and repaired at once to the cure's house, whichstood near the chateau, a little behind the church.The servant showed him into a small garden separated by a low wall fromthe cemetery.  He found the Abbe Pernot seated on a stone bench,sheltered by a trellised vine.  He was occupied in cutting up pieces ofhazel-nuts to make traps for small birds."Good-evening, Claudet!"  said the cure, without moving from his work;"you find me busy preparing my nets; if you will permit me, I willcontinue, for I should like to have my two hundred traps finished by thisevening.  The season is advancing, you know!  The birds will begin theirmigrations, and I should be greatly provoked if I were not equipped intime for the opportune moment.  And how is Monsieur de Buxieres?  I trusthe will not be less good-natured than his deceased cousin, and that hewill allow me to spread my snares on the border hedge of his woods.But," added he, as he noticed the flurried, impatient countenance of hisvisitor, "I forgot to ask you, my dear young fellow, to what happy chanceI owe your visit?  Excuse my neglect!""Don't mention it, Monsieur le Cure.  You have guessed rightly.  It is avery happy circumstance which brings me.  I am about to marry.""Aha!"  laughed the Abbe, "I congratulate you, my dear young friend.This is really delightful news.  It is not good for man to be alone, andI am glad to know you must give up the perilous life of a bachelor.Well, tell me quickly the name of your betrothed.  Do I know her?""Of course you do, Monsieur le Cure; there are few you know so well.  Itis Mademoiselle Vincart.""Reine?"The Abbe flung away the pruning-knife and branch that he was cutting, andgazed at Claudet with a stupefied air.  At the same time, his jovial facebecame shadowed, and his mouth assumed an expression of consternation."Yes, indeed, Reine Vincart," repeated Claudet, somewhat vexed at thestartled manner of his reverence; "are you surprised at my choice?""Excuse me-and-is it all settled?"  stammered the Abbe, withbewilderment, "and--and do you really love each other?""Certainly; we agree on that point; and I have come here to arrange withyou about having the banns published.""What!  already?"  murmured the cure, buttoning and unbuttoning the topof his coat in his agitation, "you seem to be in a great hurry to go towork.  The union of the man and the woman--ahem--is a serious matter,which ought not to be undertaken without due consideration.  That is thereason why the Church has instituted the sacrament of marriage.  Hastthou well considered, my son?""Why, certainly, I have reflected," exclaimed Claudet with someirritation, "and my mind is quite made up.  Once more, I ask you,Monsieur le Cure, are you displeased with my choice, or have you anythingto say against Mademoiselle Vincart?""I?  no, absolutely nothing.  Reine is an exceedingly good girl.""Well, then?""Well, my friend, I will go over to-morrow and see your fiancee, and wewill talk matters over.  I shall act for the best, in the interests ofboth of you, be assured of that.  In the meantime, you will both beunited this evening in my prayers; but, for to-day, we shall have to stopwhere we are.  Good-evening, Claudet!  I will see you again."With these enigmatic words, he dismissed the young lover, who returned tothe chateau, vexed and disturbed by his strange reception.The moment the door of the presbytery had closed behind Claudet, the AbbePernot, flinging to one side all his preparations, began to pacenervously up and down the principal garden-walk.  He appeared completelyunhinged.  His features were drawn, through an unusual tension of ideasforced upon him.  He had hurriedly caught his skullcap from his head, asif he feared the heat of his meditation might cause a rush of blood tothe head.  He quickened his steps, then stopped suddenly, folded his armswith great energy, then opened them again abruptly to thrust his handsinto the pockets of his gown, searching through them with feverishanxiety, as if he expected to find something which might solve obscureand embarrassing questions."Good Lord!  Good Lord!  What a dreadful piece of business; and right inthe bird season, too!  But I can say nothing to Claudet.  It is a secretthat does not belong to me.  How can I get out of it?  Tutt! tutt! tutt!"These monosyllabic ejaculations broke forth like the vexed clucking of afrightened blackbird; after which relief, the Abbe resumed his fitfulstriding up and down the box-bordered alley.  This lasted until the hourof twilight, when Augustine, the servant, as soon as the Angelus hadsounded, went to inform her master that they were waiting prayers for himin the church.  He obeyed the summons, although in a somewhat absentmood, and hurried over the services in a manner which did not contributeto the edification of the assistants.  As soon as he got home, he ate hisSupper without appetite, mumbled his prayers, and shut himself up in theroom he used as a study and workshop.  He remained there until the nightwas far advanced, searching through his scanty library to find two dustyvolumes treating of "cases of conscience," which he looked eagerly overby the feeble light of his study lamp.  During this laborious search heemitted frequent sighs, and only left off reading occasionally in orderto dose himself plentifully with snuff.  At last, as he felt that hiseyes were becoming inflamed, his ideas conflicting in his brain, and ashis lamp was getting low, he decided to go to bed.  But he slept badly,turned over at least twenty times, and was up with the first streak ofday to say his mass in the chapel.  He officiated with more dignity andpiety than was his wont; and after reading the second gospel he remainedfor a long while kneeling on one of the steps of the altar.  After he hadreturned to the sacristy, he divested himself quickly of his sacerdotalrobes, reached his room by a passage of communication, breakfastedhurriedly, and putting on his three-cornered hat, and seizing his knotty,cherry-wood cane, he shot out of doors as if he had been summoned to afire.Augustine, amazed at his precipitate departure, went up to the attic,and, from behind the shelter of the skylight, perceived her masterstriding rapidly along the road to Planche-au-Vacher.  There she lostsight of him--the underwood was too thick.  But, after a few minutes, thegaze of the inquisitive woman was rewarded by the appearance of a darkobject emerging from the copse, and defining itself on the bright pastureland beyond.  "Monsieur le Cure is going to La Thuiliere," thought she,and with this half-satisfaction she descended to her daily occupations.It was true, the Abbe Pernot was walking, as fast as he could, to theVincart farm, as unmindful of the dew that tarnished his shoe-buckles asof the thorns which attacked his calves.  He had that within him whichspurred him on, and rendered him unconscious of the accidents on hispath.  Never, during his twenty-five years of priestly office, had a moredifficult question embarrassed his conscience.  The case was a grave one,and moreover, so urgent that the Abbe was quite at a loss how to proceed.How was it that he never had foreseen that such a combination ofcircumstances might occur?  A priest of a more fervent spirit, who hadthe salvation of his flock more at heart, could not have been taken sounprepared.  Yes; that was surely the cause!  The profane occupations inwhich he had allowed himself to take so much enjoyment, had distractedhis watchfulness and obscured his perspicacity.  Providence was nowpunishing him for his lukewarmness, by interposing across his path thisstumbling-block, which was probably sent to him as a salutary warning,but which he saw no way of getting over.While he was thus meditating and reproaching himself, the thrushes werecalling to one another from the branches of their favorite trees; wholeflights of yellowhammers burst forth from the hedges red with haws; buthe took no heed of them and did not even give a single thought to hisneglected nests and snares.He went straight on, stumbling over the juniper bushes, and wonderingwhat he should say when he reached the farm, and how he should begin.Sometimes he addressed himself, thus: "Have I the right to speak?  What arevelation!  And to a young girl!  Oh, Lord, lead me in the straight wayof thy truth, and instruct me in the right path!"As he continued piously repeating this verse of the Psalmist, in order togain spiritual strength, the gray roofs of La Thuiliere rose before him;he could hear the crowing of the cocks and the lowing of the cows in thestable.  Five minutes after, he had pushed open the door of the kitchenwhere La Guite was arranging the bowls for breakfast."Good-morning, Guitiote," said he, in a choking voice; "is MademoiselleVincart up?""Holy Virgin!  Monsieur le Cure!  Why, certainly Mademoiselle is up.She was on foot before any of us, and now she is trotting around theorchard.  I will go fetch her.""No, do not stir.  I know the way, and I will go and find her myself."She was in the orchard, was she?  The Abbe preferred it should be so; hethought the interview would be less painful, and that the surroundingtrees would give him ideas.  He walked across the kitchen, descended thesteps leading from the ground floor to the garden, and ascended the slopein search of Reine, whom he soon perceived in the midst of a bower formedby clustering filbert-trees.At sight of the cure, Reine turned pale; he had doubtless come to tellher the result of his interview with Claudet, and what day had beendefinitely chosen for the nuptial celebration.  She had been troubled allnight by the reflection that her fate would soon be irrevocably scaled;she had wept, and her eyes betrayed it.  Only the day before, she hadlooked upon this project of marriage, which she had entertained in amoment of anger and injured feeling, as a vague thing, a vaporouseventuality of which the realization was doubtful; now, all was arranged,settled, cruelly certain; there was no way of escaping from a promisewhich Claudet, alas!  was bound to consider a serious one.  Thesethoughts traversed her mind, while the cure was slowly approaching thefilbert-trees; she felt her heart throb, and her eyes again filled withtears.  Yet her pride would not allow that the Abbe should witness herirresolution and weeping; she made an effort, overcame the momentaryweakness, and addressed the priest in an almost cheerful voice:"Monsieur le Cure, I am sorry that they have made you come up this hillto find me.  Let us go back to the farm, and I will offer you a cup ofcoffee.""No, my child," replied the Abbe, motioning with his hand that she shouldstay where she was, "no, thank you!  I will not take anything.  Remainwhere you are."I wish to talk to you, and we shall be less liable to be disturbed here."There were two rustic seats under the nut-trees; the cure took one andasked Reine to take the other, opposite to him.  There they were, underthe thick, verdant branches, hidden from indiscreet passers-by,surrounded by silence, installed as in a confessional.The morning quiet, the solitude, the half light, all invited meditationand confidence; nevertheless the young girl and the priest satmotionless; both agitated and embarrassed and watching each other withoututtering a sound.  It was Reine who first broke the silence."You have seen Claudet, Monsieur le Cure?""Yes, yes!"  replied the Abbe, sighing deeply."He--spoke to you of our-plans," continued the young girl, in a quaveringvoice, "and you fixed the day?""No, my child, we settled nothing.  I wanted to see you first, andconverse with you about something very important."The Abbe hesitated, rubbed a spot of mud off his soutane, raised hisshoulders like a man lifting a heavy burden, then gave a deep cough."My dear child," continued he at length, prudently dropping his voice atone lower, "I will begin by repeating to you what I said yesterday toClaudet Sejournant: the marriage, that is to say, the indissoluble union,of man and woman before God, is one of the most solemn and serious actsof life.  The Church has constituted it a sacrament, which sheadministers only on certain formal conditions.  Before entering into thisbond, one ought, as we are taught by Holy Writ, to sound the heart,subject the very inmost of the soul to searching examinations.  I beg ofyou, therefore, answer my questions freely, without false shame, just asif you were at the tribunal of repentance.  Do you love Claudet?"Reine trembled.  This appeal to her sincerity renewed all herperplexities and scruples.  She raised her full, glistening eyes to thecure, and replied, after a slight hesitation:"I have a sincere affection for Claudet-and-much esteem.""I understand that," replied the priest, compressing his lips, "but--excuse me if I press the matter--has the engagement you have made withhim been determined simply by considerations of affection andsuitableness, or by more interior and deeper feelings?""Pardon, Monsieur le Cure," returned Reine, coloring, "it seems to methat a sentiment of friendship, joined to a firm determination to prove afaithful and devoted wife, should be, in your eyes as they are in mine, asufficient assurance that--""Certainly, certainly, my dear child; and many husbands would becontented with less.  However, it is not only a question of Claudet'shappiness, but of yours also.  Come now!  let me ask you: is youraffection for young Sejournant so powerful that in the event of anyunforeseen circumstance happening, to break off the marriage, you wouldbe forever unhappy?""Ah!"  replied Reine, more embarrassed than ever, "you ask too grave aquestion, Monsieur le Cure!  If it were broken off without my having toreproach myself for it, it is probable that I should find consolation intime.""Very good!  Consequently, you do not love Claudet, if I may take theword love in the sense understood by people of the world.  You only like,you do not love him?  Tell me.  Answer frankly.""Frankly, Monsieur le Cure, no!""Thanks be to God!  We are saved!"  exclaimed the Abbe, drawing a longbreath, while Reine, amazed, gazed at him with wondering eves."I do not understand you," faltered she; "what is it?""It is this: the marriage can not take place.""Can not? why?""It is impossible, both in the eyes of the Church and in those of theworld."The young girl looked at him with increasing amazement."You alarm me!" cried she.  "What has happened?  What reasons hinder mefrom marrying Claudet?""Very powerful reasons, my dear child.  I do not feel at liberty toreveal them to you, but you must know that I am not speaking withoutauthority, and that you may rely on the statement I have made."Reine remained thoughtful, her brows knit, her countenance troubled."I have every confidence in you, Monsieur le Cure, but--""But you hesitate about believing me," interrupted the Abbe, piqued atnot finding in one of his flock the blind obedience on which he hadreckoned.  "You must know, nevertheless, that your pastor has no interestin deceiving you, and that when he seeks to influence you, he has in viewonly your well-being in this world and in the next.""I do not doubt your good intentions," replied Reine, with firmness, "buta promise can not be annulled without sufficient cause.  I have given myword to Claudet, and I am too loyal at heart to break faith with himwithout letting him know the reason.""You will find some pretext.""And supposing that Claudet would be content with such a pretext, my ownconscience would not be," objected the young girl, raising her clear,honest glance toward the priest; "your words have entered my soul, theyare troubling me now, and it will be worse when I begin to think thismatter over again.  I can not bear uncertainty.  I must see my wayclearly before me.  I entreat you then, Monsieur le Cure, not to dothings by halves.  You have thought it your duty to tell me I can not wedwith Claudet; now tell me why not?""Why not?  why not?"  repeated the Abbe, angrily.  "I distress myself intelling you that I am not authorized to satisfy your unwise curiosity!You must humble your intelligence and believe without arguing.""In matters of faith, that may be possible," urged Reine, obstinately,"but my marriage has nothing to do with discussing the truths of our holyreligion.  I therefore respectfully ask to be enlightened, Monsieur leCure; otherwise--""Otherwise?"  repeated the Abby Pernot, inquiringly, rolling his eyesuneasily."Otherwise, I shall keep my word respectably, and I shall marry Claudet.""You will not do that?"  said he, imploringly, joining his hands as if insupplication; "after being openly warned by me, you dare not burden yoursoul with such a terrible responsibility.  Come, my child, does not thepossibility of committing a mortal sin alarm your conscience as aChristian?""I can not sin if I am in ignorance, and as to my conscience, Monsieur leCure, do you think it is acting like a Christian to alarm withoutenlightening?""Is that your last word?"  inquired the Abbe, completely aghast."It is my last word," she replied, vehemently, moved both by a feeling ofself-respect, and a desire to force the hand of her interlocutor."You are a proud, obstinate girl!"  exclaimed the Abbe, rising abruptly,"you wish to compel me to reveal this secret!  Well, have your way!I will tell you.  May the harm which may result from it fall lightly uponyou, and do not hereafter reproach me for the pain I am about to inflictupon you."He checked himself for a moment, again joined his hands, and raising hiseyes toward heaven ejaculated fervently, as if repeating his devotions inthe oratory: "O Lord, thou knowest I would have spared her this bittercup, but, between two evils, I have avoided the greater.  If I forfeit mysolemn promise, consider, O Lord, I pray thee, that I do it to avoiddisgrace and exposure for her, and deign to forgive thy servant!"He seated himself again, placed one of his hands before his eyes, andbegan, in a hollow voice, Reine, all the while gazing nervously at him:"My child, you are forcing me to violate a secret which has been solemnlyconfided to me.  It concerns a matter not usually talked about beforeyoung girls, but you are, I believe, already a woman in heart andunderstanding, and you will hear resignedly what I have to tell you,however much the recital may trouble you.  I have already informed youthat your marriage with Claudet is impossible.  I now declare that itwould be criminal, for the reason that incest is an abomination.""Incest!"  repeated Reine, pale and trembling, "what do you mean?""I mean," sighed the cure, "that you are Claudet's sister, not having thesame mother, but the same father: Claude-Odouart de Buxieres.""Oh! you are mistaken! that cannot be!""I am stating facts.  It grieves me to the heart, my dear child, that inspeaking of your deceased mother, I should have to reveal an error overwhich she lamented, like David, with tears of blood.  She confessed hersin, not to the priest, but to a friend, a few days before her death.In justice to her memory, I ought to add that, like most of theunfortunates seduced by this untamable de Buxieres, she succumbed to hiswily misrepresentations.  She was a victim rather than an accomplice.The man himself acknowledged as much in a note entrusted to my care,which I have here."And the Abbe' drew from his pocket an old, worn letter, the writingyellow with age, and placed it before Reine.  In this letter, written inClaude de Buxieres's coarse, sprawling hand, doubtless in reply to areproachful appeal from his mistress, he endeavored to offer some kind ofhonorable amends for the violence he had used, and to calm MadameVincart's remorse by promising, as was his custom, to watch over thefuture of the child which should be born to her."That child was yourself, my poor girl," continued the Abbe, picking upthe letter which Reine had thrown down, after reading it, with a gestureof sickened disgust.She appeared not to hear him.  She had buried her face in her hands, tohide the flushing of her cheeks, and sat motionless, altogether crushedbeneath the shameful revelation; convulsive sobs and tremblingsoccasionally agitating her frame."You can now understand," continued the priest, "how the announcement ofthis projected marriage stunned and terrified me.  I could not confide toClaudet the reason for my stupefaction, and I should have been thankfulif you could have understood so that I could have spared you this cruelmortification, but you would not take any intimation from me.  And now,forgive me for inflicting this cross upon you, and bear it with courage,with Christian fortitude.""You have acted as was your duty," murmured Reine, sadly, "and I thankyou, Monsieur le Cure!""And will you promise me to dismiss Claudet at once--today?""I promise you."The Abbe Pernot advanced to take her hand, and administer some words ofconsolation; but she evaded, with a stern gesture, the good man's pioussympathy, and escaped toward the dwelling.The spacious kitchen was empty when she entered.  The shutters had beenclosed against the sun, and it had become cool and pleasant.  Here andthere, among the copper utensils, and wherever a chance ray made a gleamof light, the magpie was hopping about, uttering short, piercing cries.In the recess of the niche containing the colored prints, sat the old manVincart, dozing, in his usual supine attitude, his hands spread out, hiseyelids drooping, his mouth half open.  At the sound of the door, hiseyes opened wide.  He rather guessed at, than saw, the entrance of theyoung girl, and his pallid lips began their accustomed refrain: "Reine!Rei-eine!"Reine flew impetuously toward the paralytic old man, threw herself on herknees before him, sobbing bitterly, and covered his hands with kisses.Her caresses were given in a more respectful, humble, contrite mannerthan ever before."Oh!  father--father!"  faltered she; "I loved you always, I shall loveyou now with all my heart and soul!"CHAPTER VIIILOVE'S SAD ENDINGThe kitchen was bright with sunshine, and the industrious bees werebuzzing around the flowers on the window-sills, while Reine waslistlessly attending to culinary duties, and preparing her father's meal.The humiliating disclosures made by the Abbe Pernot weighed heavily uponher mind.  She foresaw that Claudet would shortly be at La Thuiliere inorder to hear the result of the cure's visit; but she did not feelsufficiently mistress of herself to have a decisive interview with him atsuch short notice, and resolved to gain at least one day by absentingherself from the farm.  It seemed to her necessary that she should havethat length of time to arrange her ideas, and evolve some way ofseparating Claudet and herself without his suspecting the real motive ofrupture.  So, telling La Guite to say that unexpected business had calledher away, she set out for the woods of Maigrefontaine.Whenever she had felt the need of taking counsel with herself beforedeciding on any important matter, the forest had been her refuge and herinspiration.  The refreshing solitude of the valleys, watered by livingstreams, acted as a strengthening balm to her irresolute will; her soulinhaled the profound peace of these leafy retreats.  By the time she hadreached the inmost shade of the forest her mind had become calmer, andbetter able to unravel the confusion of thoughts that surged liketroubled waters through her brain.  The dominant idea was, that her self-respect had been wounded; the shock to her maidenly modesty, and theshame attendant upon the fact, affected her physically, as if she hadbeen belittled and degraded by a personal stain; and this downfall causedher deep humiliation.  By slow degrees, however, and notwithstanding thisstate of abject despair, she felt, cropping up somewhere in her heart, afaint germ of gladness, and, by close examination, discovered its origin:she was now loosed from her obligations toward Claudet, and the prospectof being once more free afforded her immediate consolation.She had so much regretted, during the last few weeks, the feeling ofoutraged pride which had incited her to consent to this marriage; herloyal, sincere nature had revolted at the constraint she had imposed uponherself; her nerves had been so severely taxed by having to receive herfiance with sufficient warmth to satisfy his expectations, and yet notafford any encouragement to his demonstrative tendencies, that thecertainty of her newly acquired freedom created a sensation of relief andwell-being.  But, hardly had she analyzed and acknowledged this sensationwhen she reproached herself for harboring it when she was about to causeClaudet such affliction.Poor Claudet!  what a cruel blow was in store for him!  He was soguilelessly in love, and had such unbounded confidence in the success ofhis projects!  Reine was overcome by tender reminiscences.  She hadalways experienced, as if divining by instinct the natural bonds whichunited them, a sisterly affection for Claudet.  Since their earliestinfancy, at the age when they learned their catechism under the churchporch, they had been united in a bond of friendly fellowship.  WithReine, this tender feeling had always remained one of friendship, but,with Claudet, it had ripened into love; and now, after allowing the pooryoung fellow to believe that his love was reciprocated, she was forced todisabuse him.  It was useless for her to try to find some way ofsoftening the blow; there was none.  Claudet was too much in love toremain satisfied with empty words; he would require solid reasons; andthe only conclusive one which would convince him, without wounding hisself-love, was exactly the one which the young girl could not give him.She was, therefore, doomed to send Claudet away with the impression thathe had been jilted by a heartless and unprincipled coquette.  And yetsomething must be done.  The grand chasserot had been too long already inthe toils; there was something barbarously cruel in not freeing him fromhis illusions.In this troubled state of mind, Reine gazed appealingly at the silentwitnesses of her distress.  She heard a voice within her saying to thetall, vaulted ash, "Inspire me!"  to the little rose-colored centaurea ofthe wayside, "Teach me a charm to cure the harm I have done!"  But thewoods, which in former days had been her advisers and instructors,remained deaf to her invocation.  For the first time, she felt herselfisolated and abandoned to her own resources, even in the midst of herbeloved forest.It is when we experience these violent mental crises, that we becomesuddenly conscious of Nature's cold indifference to our sufferings.  Shereally is nothing more than the reflex of our own sensations, and canonly give us back what we lend her.  Beautiful but selfish, she allowsherself to be courted by novices, but presents a freezing, emotionlessaspect to those who have outlived their illusions.Reine did not reach home until the day had begun to wane.  La Guiteinformed her that Claudet had waited for her during part of theafternoon, and that he would come again the next day at nine o'clock.Notwithstanding her bodily fatigue, she slept uneasily, and her sleep wastroubled by feverish dreams.  Every time she closed her eyes, she fanciedherself conversing with Claudet, and woke with a start at the sound ofhis angry voice.She arose at dawn, descended at once to the lower floor, to get throughher morning tasks, and as soon as the big kitchen clock struck nine, sheleft the house and took the path by which Claudet would come.  A feelingof delicate consideration toward her lover had impelled her to choose forher explanation any other place than the one where she had first receivedhis declaration of love, and consented to the marriage.  Very soon hecame in sight, his stalwart figure outlined against the gray landscape.He was walking rapidly; her heart smote her, her hands became like ice,but she summoned all her fortitude, and went bravely forward to meet him.When he came within forty or fifty feet, he recognized Reine, and took ashort cut across the stubble studded with cobwebs glistening with dew."Aha! my Reine, my queen, good-morning!"  cried he, joyously, "it issweet of you to come to meet me!""Good-morning, Claudet.  I came to meet you because I wish to speak withyou on matters of importance, and I preferred not to have theconversation take place in our house.  Shall we walk as far as thePlanche-au-Vacher?"He stopped short, astonished at the proposal and also at the sad andresolute attitude of his betrothed.  He examined her more closely,noticed her deep-set eyes, her cheeks, whiter than usual."Why, what is the matter, Reine?"  he inquired; "you are not yourself; doyou not feel well?""Yes, and no.  I have passed a bad night, thinking over matters that aretroubling me, and I think that has produced some fever.""What matters?  Any that concern us?""Yes;" replied she, laconically.Claudet opened his eyes.  The young girl's continued gravity began toalarm him; but, seeing that she walked quickly forward, with an absentair, her face lowered, her brows bent, her mouth compressed, he lostcourage and refrained from asking her any questions.  They walked on thusin silence, until they came to the open level covered with juniper-bushes, from which solitary place, surrounded by hawthorn hedges, theycould trace the narrow defile leading to Vivey, and the faint mistbeyond."Let us stop here," said Reine, seating herself on a flat, mossy stone,"we can talk here without fear of being disturbed.""No fear of that," remarked Claudet, with a forced smile, "with theexception of the shepherd of Vivey, who comes here sometimes with hiscattle, we shall not see many passers-by.  It must be a secret that youhave to tell me, Reine?"  he added."No;" she returned, "but I foresee that my words will give you pain, mypoor Claudet, and I prefer you should hear them without being annoyed bythe farm-people passing to and fro.""Explain yourself!"  he exclaimed, impetuously.  "For heaven's sake,don't keep me in suspense!""Listen, Claudet.  When you asked my hand in marriage, I answered yes,without taking time to reflect.  But, since I have been thinking over ourplans, I have had scruples.  My father is becoming every day more of aninvalid, and in his present state I really have no right to live for anyone but him.  One would think he was aware of our intentions, for sinceyou have been visiting at the farm, he is more agitated and suffers more.I think that any change in his way of living would bring on a stroke, andI never should forgive myself if I thought I had shortened his life.That is the reason why, as long as I have him with me, I do not see thatit will be possible for me to dispose of myself.  On the other hand, I donot wish to abuse your patience.  I therefore ask you to take back yourliberty and give me back my promise.""That is to say, you won't have me!"  he exclaimed."No; my poor friend, it means only that I shall not marry so long as myfather is living, and that I can not ask you to wait until I am perfectlyfree.  Forgive me for having entered into the engagement too carelessly,and do not on that account take your friendship from me.""Reine," interrupted Claudet, angrily, "don't turn your brain inside outto make me believe that night is broad day.  I am not a child, and I seevery well that your father's health is only a pretext.  You don't wantme, that's all, and, with all due respect, you have changed your mindvery quickly!  Only the day before yesterday you authorized me to arrangeabout the day for the ceremony with the Abbe Pernot.  Now that you havehad a visit from the cure, you want to put the affair off until the weekwhen two Sundays come together!  I am a little curious to know what thatconfounded old abbe has been babbling about me, to turn you inside outlike a glove in such a short time."Claudet's conscience reminded him of several rare frolics, chance love-affairs, meetings in the woods, and so on, and he feared the priest mighthave told Reine some unfavorable stories about him.  "Ah!"  he continued,clenching his fists, "if this old poacher in a cassock has done me an illturn with you, he will not have much of a chance for paradise!""Undeceive yourself," said Reine, quickly, "Monsieur le Cure is yourfriend, like myself; he esteems you highly, and never has said anythingbut good of you.""Oh, indeed!"  sneered the young man, "as you are both so fond of me, howdoes it happen that you have given me my dismissal the very day afteryour interview with the cure?"Reine, knowing Claudet's violent disposition, and wishing to avoidtrouble for the cure, thought it advisable to have recourse to evasion."Monsieur le Cure," said she, "has had no part in my decision.  He hasnot spoken against you, and deserves no reproaches from you.""In that case, why do you send me away?""I repeat again, the comfort and peace of my father are paramount withme, and I do not intend to marry so long as he may have need of me.""Well," said Claudet, persistently, "I love you, and I will wait.""It can not be.""Why?""Because," replied she, sharply, "because it would be kind neither toyou, nor to my father, nor to me.  Because marriages that drag along inthat way are never good for anything!""Those are bad reasons!"  he muttered, gloomily."Good or bad," replied the young girl, "they appear valid to me, and Ihold to them.""Reine," said he, drawing near to her and looking straight into her eyes,"can you swear, by the head of your father, that you have given me thetrue reason for your rejecting me?"She became embarrassed, and remained silent."See!"  he exclaimed, "you dare not take the oath!""My word should suffice," she faltered."No; it does not suffice.  But your silence says a great deal, I tellyou!  You are too frank, Reine, and you don't know how to lie.  I read itin your eyes, I do.  The true reason is that you do not love me."She shrugged her shoulders and turned away her head."No, you do not love me.  If you had any love for me, instead ofdiscouraging me, you would hold out some hope to me, and advise me tohave patience.  You never have loved me, confess now!"By dint of this persistence, Reine by degrees lost her self-confidence.She could realize how much Claudet was suffering, and she reproachedherself for the torture she was inflicting upon him.  Driven into acorner, and recognizing that the avowal he was asking for was the onlyone that would drive him away, she hesitated no longer."Alas!"  she murmured, lowering her eyes, "since you force me to tell yousome truths that I would rather have kept from you, I confess you haveguessed.  I have a sincere friendship for you, but that is all.  I haveconcluded that to marry a person one ought to love him differently, morethan everything else in the world, and I feel that my heart is not turnedaltogether toward you.""No," said Claudet, bitterly, "it is turned elsewhere.""What do you mean?  I do not understand you.""I mean that you love some one else.""That is not true," she protested."You are blushing--a proof that I have hit the nail!""Enough of this!"  cried she, imperiously."You are right.  Now that you have said you don't want me any longer, Ihave no right to ask anything further.  Adieu!"He turned quickly on his heel.  Reine was conscious of having been toohard with him, and not wishing him to go away with such a grief in hisheart, she sought to retain him by placing her hand upon his arm."Come, Claudet," said she, entreatingly, "do not let us part in anger.It pains me to see you suffer, and I am sorry if I have said anythingunkind to you.  Give me your hand in good fellowship, will you?"But Claudet drew back with a fierce gesture, and glancing angrily atReine, he replied, rudely:"Thanks for your regrets and your pity; I have no use for them."  Sheunderstood that he was deeply hurt; gave up entreating, and turned awaywith eyes full of tears.He remained motionless, his arms crossed, in the middle of the road.After some minutes, he turned his head.  Reine was already nothing morethan a dark speck against the gray of the increasing fog.  Then he wentoff, haphazard, across the pasture-lands.  The fog was rising slowly, andthe sun, shorn of its beams, showed its pale face faintly through it.  Tothe right and the left, the woods were half hidden by moving whitebillows, and Claudet walked between fluid walls of vapor.  This hiddensky, these veiled surroundings, harmonized with his mental condition.  Itwas easier for him to hide his chagrin.  "Some one else!  Yes; that's it.She loves some other fellow!  how was it I did not find that out the veryfirst day?"  Then he recalled how Reine shrank from him when he soliciteda caress; how she insisted on their betrothal being kept secret, and howmany times she had postponed the date of the wedding.  It was evidentthat she had received him only in self-defence, and on the pleading ofJulien de Buxieres.  Julien! the name threw a gleam of light across hisbrain, hitherto as foggy as the country around him.  Might not Julien bethe fortunate rival on whom Reine's affections were so obstinately set?Still, if she had always loved Monsieur de Buxieres, in what spirit ofperversity or thoughtlessness had she suffered the advances of anothersuitor?Reine was no coquette, and such a course of action would be repugnant toher frank, open nature.  It was a profound enigma, which Claudet, who hadplenty of good common sense, but not much insight, was unable to solve.But grief has, among its other advantages, the power of rendering ourperceptions more acute; and by dint of revolving the question in hismind, Claudet at last became enlightened.  Had not Reine simply followedthe impulse of her wounded feelings?  She was very proud, and when theman whom she secretly loved had come coolly forward to plead the cause ofone who was indifferent to her, would not her self-respect be lowered,and would she not, in a spirit of bravado, accept the proposition, inorder that he might never guess the sufferings of her spurned affections?There was no doubt, that, later, recognizing that the task was beyond herstrength, she had felt ashamed of deceiving Claudet any longer, and,acting on the advice of the Abbe Pernot, had made up her mind to breakoff a union that was repugnant to her."Yes;" he repeated, mournfully to himself, "that must have been the wayit happened."  And with this kind of explanation of Reine's actions, hisirritation seemed to lessen.  Not that his grief was less poignant, butthe first burst of rage had spent itself like a great wind-storm, whichbecomes lulled after a heavy fall of rain; the bitterness was toned down,and he was enabled to reason more clearly.Julien--well, what was the part of Julien in all this disturbance?  "Ifwhat I imagine is true," thought he, "Monsieur de Buxieres knows thatReine loves him, but has he any reciprocal feeling for her?  With a manas mysterious as my cousin, it is not easy to find out what is going onin his heart.  Anyhow, I have no right to complain of him; as soon as hediscovered my love for Reine, did he not, besides ignoring his own claim,offer spontaneously to take my message?  Still, there is something queerat the bottom of it all, and whatever it costs me, I am going to find itout."At this moment, through the misty air, he heard faintly the village clockstrike eleven.  "Already so late!  how the time flies, even when one issuffering!"  He bent his course toward the chateau, and, breathless andexcited, without replying to Manette's inquiries, he burst into the hallwhere his cousin was pacing up and down, waiting for breakfast.  At thissudden intrusion Julien started, and noted Claudet's quick breathing anddisordered state."Ho, ho!"  exclaimed he, in his usual, sarcastic tone, "what a hurry youare in!  I suppose you have come to say the wedding-day is fixed atlast?""No!"  replied Claudet, briefly, "there will be no wedding."Julien tottered, and turned to face his cousin."What's that?  Are you joking?""I am in no mood for joking.  Reine will not have me; she has taken backher promise."While pronouncing these words, he scrutinized attentively his cousin'scountenance, full in the light from the opposite window.  He saw hisfeatures relax, and his eyes glow with the same expression which he hadnoticed a few days previous, when he had referred to the fact that Reinehad again postponed the marriage."Whence comes this singular change?"  stammered de Buxieres, visiblyagitated; "what reasons does Mademoiselle Vincart give in explanation?""Idle words: her father's health, disinclination to leave him.  You maysuppose I take such excuses for what they are worth.  The real cause ofher refusal is more serious and more mortifying.""You know it, then?"  exclaimed Julien, eagerly."I know it, because I forced Reine to confess it.""And the reason is?""That she does not love me.""Reine--does not love you!"Again a gleam of light irradiated the young man's large, blue eyes.Claudet was leaning against the table, in front of his cousin; hecontinued slowly, looking him steadily in the face:"That is not all.  Not only does Reine not love me, but she loves someone else."Julien changed color; the blood coursed over his cheeks, his forehead,his ears; he drooped his head."Did she tell you so?"  he murmured, at last, feebly."She did not, but I guessed it.  Her heart is won, and I think I know bywhom."Claudet had uttered these last words slowly and with a painful effort, atthe same time studying Julien's countenance with renewed inquiry.  Thelatter became more and more troubled, and his physiognomy expressed bothanxiety and embarrassment."Whom do you suspect?"  he stammered."Oh!"  replied Claudet, employing a simple artifice to sound the obscuredepth of his cousin's heart, "it is useless to name the person; you donot know him.""A stranger?"Julien's countenance had again changed.  His hands were twitchingnervously, his lips compressed, and his dilated pupils were blazing withanger, instead of triumph, as before."Yes; a stranger, a clerk in the iron-works at Grancey, I think.""You think!--you think!"  cried Julien, fiercely, "why don't you havemore definite information before you accuse Mademoiselle Vincart of suchtreachery?"He resumed pacing the hall, while his interlocutor, motionless, remainedsilent, and kept his eyes steadily upon him."It is not possible," resumed Julien, "Reine can not have played us sucha trick!  When I spoke to her for you, it was so easy to say she wasalready betrothed!""Perhaps," objected Claudet, shaking his head, "she had reasons for notletting you know all that was in her mind.""What reasons?""She doubtless believed at that time that the man she preferred did notcare for her.  There are some people who, when they are vexed, act indirect contradiction to their own wishes.  I have the idea that Reineaccepted me only for want of some one better, and afterward, being tooopenhearted to dissimulate for any length of time, she thought better ofit, and sent me about my business.""And you," interrupted Julien, sarcastically, "you, who had been acceptedas her betrothed, did not know better how to defend your rights than tosuffer yourself to be ejected by a rival, whose intentions, even, youhave not clearly ascertained!""By Jove!  how could I help it?  A fellow that takes an unwilling brideis playing for too high stakes.  The moment I found there was another shepreferred, I had but one course before me--to take myself off.""And you call that loving!"  shouted de Buxieres, "you call that losingyour heart!  God in heaven!  if I had been in your place, how differentlyI should have acted!  Instead of leaving, with piteous protestations,I should have stayed near Reine, I should have surrounded her withtenderness.  I should have expressed my passion with so much force thatits flame should pass from my burning soul to hers, and she would havebeen forced to love me!  Ah!  If I had only thought!  if I had dared!how different it would have been!"He jerked out his sentences with unrestrained frenzy.  He seemed hardlyto know what he was saying, or that he had a listener.  Claudet stoodcontemplating him in sullen silence: "Aha!" thought he, with bitterresignation; "I have sounded you at last.  I know what is in the bottomof your heart."Manette, bringing in the breakfast, interrupted their colloquy, and bothassumed an air of indifference, according to a tacit understanding that aprudent amount of caution should be observed in her presence.  They atehurriedly, and as soon as the cloth was removed, and they were againalone, Julien, glancing with an indefinable expression at Claudet,muttered savagely:"Well!  what do you decide?""I will tell you later," responded the other, briefly.He quitted the room abruptly, told Manette that he would not be homeuntil late, and strode out across the fields, his dog following.  He hadtaken his gun as a blind, but it was useless for Montagnard to raise hisbark; Claudet allowed the hares to scamper away with out sending a singleshot after them.  He was busy inwardly recalling the details of theconversation he had had with his cousin.  The situation now wassimplified Julien was in love with Reine, and was vainly combating hisoverpowering passion.  What reason had he for concealing his love?  Whatmotive or reasoning had induced him, when he was already secretlyenamored of the girl, to push Claudet in front and interfere to procureher acceptance of him as a fiance?  This point alone remained obscure.Was Julien carrying out certain theories of the respect due his positionin society, and did he fear to contract a misalliance by marrying a merefarmer's daughter?  Or did he, with his usual timidity and distrust ofhimself, dread being refused by Reine, and, half through pride, halfthrough backward ness, keep away for fear of a humiliating rejection?With de Buxieres's proud and suspicious nature, each of thesesuppositions was equally likely.  The conclusion most undeniable was,that notwithstanding his set ideas and his moral cowardice, Julien had anardent and over powering love for Mademoiselle Vincart.  As to Reineherself, Claudet was more than ever convinced that she had a secretinclination toward somebody, although she had denied the charge.  But forwhom was her preference?  Claudet knew the neighborhood too well tobelieve the existence of any rival worth talking about, other than hiscousin de Buxieres.  None of the boys of the village or the surroundingtowns had ever come courting old Father Vincart's daughter, and deBuxieres himself possessed sufficient qualities to attract Reine.Certainly, if he were a girl, he never should fix upon Julien for alover; but women often have tastes that men can not comprehend, andJulien's refinement of nature, his bashfulness, and even his reserve,might easily have fascinated a girl of such strong will and somewhatpeculiar notions.  It was probable, therefore, that she liked him,and perhaps had done so for a long time; but, being clear-sighted andimpartial, she could see that he never would marry her, because hercondition in life was not equal to his own.  Afterward, when the man sheloved had flaunted his indifference so far as to plead the cause ofanother, her pride had revolted, and in the blind agony of her woundedfeelings, she had thrown herself into the arms of the first comer, as ifto punish herself for entertaining loving thoughts of a man who could sodisdain her affection.So, by means of that lucid intuition which the heart alone can furnish,Claudet at last succeeded in evolving the naked truth.  But the fatiguinglabor of so much thinking, to which his brain was little accustomed,and the sadness which continued to oppress him, overcame him to such anextent that he was obliged to sit down and rest on a clump of brushwood.He gazed over the woods and the clearings, which he had so oftentraversed light of heart and of foot, and felt mortally unhappy.  Thesesheltering lanes and growing thickets, where he had so frequentlyencountered Reine, the beautiful hunting-grounds in which he had takensuch delight, only awakened painful sensations, and he felt as if heshould grow to hate them all if he were obliged to pass the rest of hisdays in their midst.  As the day waned, the sinuosities of the forestbecame more blended; the depth of the valleys was lost in thick vapors.The wind had risen.  The first falling leaves of the season rose and felllike wounded birds; heavy clouds gathered in the sky, and the night wascoming on apace.  Claudet was grateful for the sudden darkness, whichwould blot out a view now so distasteful to him.  Shortly, on theAuberive side, along the winding Aubette, feeble lights became visible,as if inviting the young man to profit by their guidance.  He arose,took the path indicated, and went to supper, or rather, to a pretence ofsupper, in the same inn where he had breakfasted with Julien, whence thelatter had gone on his mission to Reine.  This remembrance alone wouldhave sufficed to destroy his appetite.He did not remain long at table; he could not, in fact, stay many minutesin one place, and so, notwithstanding the urgent insistence of thehostess, he started on the way back to Vivey, feeling his way through theprofound darkness.  When he reached the chateau, every one was in bed.Noiselessly, his dog creeping after him, he slipped into his room, and,overcome with fatigue, fell into a heavy slumber.The next morning his first visit was to Julien.  He found him in anervous and feverish condition, having passed a sleepless night.Claudet's revelations had entirely upset his intentions, and plantedfresh thorns of jealousy in his heart.  On first hearing that themarriage was broken off, his heart had leaped for joy, and hope hadrevived within him; but the subsequent information that MademoiselleVincart was probably interested in some lover, as yet unknown, hadgrievously sobered him.  He was indignant at Reine's duplicity, andClaudet's cowardly resignation.  The agony caused by Claudet's betrothalwas a matter of course, but this love-for-a-stranger episode was anunexpected and mortal wound.  He was seized with violent fits of rage; hewas sometimes tempted to go and reproach the young girl with what hecalled her breach of faith, and then go and throw himself at her feet andavow his own passion.But the mistrust he had of himself, and his incurable bashfulness,invariably prevented these heroic resolutions from being carried out.He had so long cultivated a habit of minute, fatiguing criticism uponevery inward emotion that he had almost incapacitated himself forvigorous action.He was in this condition when Claudet came in upon him.  At the noise ofthe opening door, Julien raised his head, and looked dolefully at hiscousin."Well?"  said he, languidly."Well!"  retorted Claudet, bravely, "on thinking over what has beenhappening during the last month, I have made sure of one thing of which Iwas doubtful.""Of what were you doubtful?"  returned de Buxieres, quite ready to takeoffence at the answer."I am about to tell you.  Do you remember the first conversation we hadtogether concerning Reine?  You spoke of her with so much earnestnessthat I then suspected you of being in love with her.""I--I--hardly remember," faltered Julien, coloring."In that case, my memory is better than yours, Monsieur de Buxieres.To-day, my suspicions have become certainties.  You are in love withReine Vincart!""I?"  faintly protested his cousin."Don't deny it, but rather, give me your confidence; you will not besorry for it.  You love Reine, and have loved her for a long while.You have succeeded in hiding it from me because it is hard for you tounbosom yourself; but, yesterday, I saw it quite plainly.  You dare notaffirm the contrary!"Julien, greatly agitated, had hidden his face in his hands.  After amoment's silence, he replied, defiantly: "Well, and supposing it is so?What is the use of talking about it, since Reine's affections are placedelsewhere?""Oh!  that's another matter.  Reine has declined to have me, and I reallythink she has some other affair in her head.  Yet, to confess the truth,the clerk at the iron-works was a lover of my own imagining; she neverthought of him.""Then why did you tell such a lie?" cried Julien, impetuously."Because I thought I would plead the lie to get at the truth.  Forgiveme for having made use of this old trick to put you on the right track.It wasn't such a bad idea, for I succeeded in finding out what you tookso much pains to hide from me.""To hide from you?  Yes, I did wish to hide it from you.  Wasn't thatright, since I was convinced that Reine loved you?"  exclaimed Julien, inan almost stifled voice, as if the avowal were choking him.  "I havealways thought it idle to parade one's feelings before those who do notcare about them.""You were wrong," returned poor Claudet, sighing deeply, "if you hadspoken for yourself, I have an idea you would have been better received,and you would have spared me a terrible heart-breaking."He said it with such profound sadness that Julien, notwithstanding theabsorbing nature of his own thoughts, was quite overcome, and almost onthe point of confessing, openly, the intensity of his feeling towardReine Vincart.  But, accustomed as he was, by long habit, to concentrateevery emotion within himself, he found it impossible to become, all atonce, communicative; he felt an invincible and almost maidenlybashfulness at the idea of revealing the secret sentiments of his soul,and contented himself with saying, in a low voice:"Do you not love her any more, then?""I? oh, yes, indeed!  But to be refused by the only girl I ever wished tomarry takes all the spirit out of me.  I am so discouraged, I feel likeleaving the country.  If I were to go, it would perhaps be doing you aservice, and that would comfort me a little.  You have treated me as afriend, and that is a thing one doesn't forget.  I have not the means topay you back for your kindness, but I think I should be less sorry to goif my departure would leave the way more free for you to return to LaThuiliere.""You surely would not leave on my account?"  exclaimed Julien, in alarm."Not solely on your account, rest assured.  If Reine had loved me, itnever would have entered my head to make such a sacrifice for you, butshe will not have me.  I am good for nothing here.  I am only in yourway.""But that is a wild idea!  Where would you go?""Oh!  there would be no difficulty about that.  One plan would be to goas a soldier.  Why not?  I am hardy, a good walker, a good shot, canstand fatigue; I have everything needed for military life.  It is anoccupation that I should like, and I could earn my epaulets as well as myneighbor.  So that perhaps, Monsieur de Buxieres, matters might in thatway be arranged to suit everybody.""Claudet!" stammered Julien, his voice thick with sobs, "you are a betterman than I!  Yes; you are a better man than I!"And, for the first time, yielding to an imperious longing for expansion,he sprang toward the grand chasserot, clasped him in his arms, andembraced him fraternally."I will not let you expatriate yourself on my account," he continued;"do not act rashly, I entreat!""Don't worry," replied Claudet, laconically, "if I so decide, it will notbe without deliberation."In fact, during the whole of the ensuing week, he debated in his mindthis question of going away.  Each day his position at Vivey seemed moreunbearable.  Without informing any one, he had been to Langres andconsulted an officer of his acquaintance on the subject of theformalities required previous to enrolment.At last, one morning he resolved to go over to the military division andsign his engagement.  But he was not willing to consummate this sacrificewithout seeing Reine Vincart for the last time.  He was nursing, down inthe bottom of his heart, a vague hope, which, frail and slender as thefilament of a plant, was yet strong enough to keep him on his nativesoil.  Instead of taking the path to Vivey, he made a turn in thedirection of La Thuiliere, and soon reached the open elevation whence theroofs of the farm-buildings and the turrets of the chateau could bothalike be seen.  There he faltered, with a piteous sinking of the heart.Only a few steps between himself and the house, yet he hesitated aboutentering; not that he feared a want of welcome, but because he dreadedlest the reawakening of his tenderness should cause him to lose a portionof the courage he should need to enable him to leave.  He leaned againstthe trunk of an old pear-tree and surveyed the forest site on which thefarm was built.The landscape retained its usual placidity.  In the distance, over thewaste lands, the shepherd Tringuesse was following his flock of sheep,which occasionally scattered over the fields, and then, under the dog'sharassing watchfulness, reformed in a compact group, previous todescending the narrow hill-slope.  One thing struck Claudet: the pasturesand the woods bore exactly the same aspect, presented the same play oflight and shade as on that afternoon of the preceding year, when he hadmet Reine in the Ronces woods, a few days before the arrival of Julien.The same bright yet tender tint reddened the crab-apple and the wild-cherry; the tomtits and the robins chirped as before, among the bushes,and, as in the previous year, one heard the sound of the beechnuts andacorns dropping on the rocky paths.  Autumn went through her tranquilrites and familiar operations, always with the same punctual regularity;and all this would go on just the same when Claudet was no longer there.There would only be one lad the less in the village streets, one hunterfailing to answer the call when they were surrounding the woods ofCharbonniere.  This dim perception of how small a space man occupies onthe earth, and of the ease with which he is forgotten, aided Claudetunconsciously in his effort to be resigned, and he determined to enterthe house.  As he opened the gate of the courtyard, he found himself faceto face with Reine, who was coming out.The young girl immediately supposed he had come to make a last assault,in the hope of inducing her to yield to his wishes.  She feared a renewalof the painful scene which had closed their last interview, and her firstimpulse was to put herself on her guard.  Her countenance darkened, andshe fixed a cold, questioning gaze upon Claudet, as if to keep him at adistance.  But, when she noted the sadness of her young relative'sexpression, she was seized with pity.  Making an effort, however, todisguise her emotion, she pretended to accost him with the calm andcordial friendship of former times."Why, good-morning, Claudet," said she, "you come just in time.A quarter of an hour later you would not have found me.  Will you comein and rest a moment?""Thanks, Reine," said he, "I will not hinder you in your work.  But Iwanted to say, I am sorry I got angry the other day; you were right, wemust not leave each other with ill-feeling, and, as I am going away for along time, I desire first to take your hand in friendship.""You are going away?""Yes; I am going now to Langres to enroll myself as a soldier.  And trueit is, one knows when one goes away, but it is hard to know when one willcome back.  That is why I wanted to say good-by to you, and make peace,so as not to go away with too great a load on my heart."All Reine's coldness melted away.  This young fellow, who was leaving hiscountry on her account, was the companion of her infancy, more than that,her nearest relative.  Her throat swelled, her eyes filled with tears.She turned away her head, that he might not perceive her emotion, andopened the kitchen-door."Come in, Claudet," said she, "we shall be more comfortable in thedining-room.  We can talk there, and you will have some refreshmentbefore you go, will you not?"He obeyed, and followed her into the house.  She went herself into thecellar, to seek a bottle of old wine, brought two glasses, and filledthem with a trembling hand."Shall you remain long in the service?"  asked she."I shall engage for seven years.""It is a hard life that you are choosing.""What am I to do?"  replied he, "I could not stay here doing nothing."Reine went in and out of the room in a bewildered fashion.  Claudet, toomuch excited to perceive that the young girl's impassiveness was only onthe surface, said to himself: "It is all over; she accepts my departureas an event perfectly natural; she treats me as she would Theotime, thecoal-dealer, or the tax-collector Boucheseiche.  A glass of wine, two orthree unimportant questions, and then, good-by-a pleasant journey, andtake care of yourself!"Then he made a show of taking an airy, insouciant tone."Oh, well!"  he exclaimed, "I've always been drawn toward that kind oflife.  A musket will be a little heavier than a gun, that's all; then Ishall see different countries, and that will change my ideas."  He triedto appear facetious, poking around the kitchen, and teasing the magpie,which was following his footsteps with inquisitive anxiety.  Finally, hewent up to the old man Vincart, who was lying stretched out in hispicture-lined niche.  He took the flabby hand of the paralytic old man,pressed it gently and endeavored to get up a little conversation withhim, but he had it all to himself, the invalid staring at him all thetime with uneasy, wide-open eyes.  Returning to Reine, he lifted hisglass."To your health, Reine!"  said he, with forced gayety, "next time weclink glasses together, I shall be an experienced soldier--you'll see!"But, when he put the glass to his lips, several big tears fell in, and hehad to swallow them with his wine."Well!" he sighed, turning away while he passed the back of his handacross his eyes, "it must be time to go."She accompanied him to the threshold."Adieu, Reine!""Adieu!"  she murmured, faintly.She stretched out both hands, overcome with pity and remorse.  Heperceived her emotion, and thinking that she perhaps still loved him alittle, and repented having rejected him, threw his arms impetuouslyaround her.  He pressed her against his bosom, and imprinted kisses, wetwith tears, upon her cheek.  He could not leave her, and redoubled hiscaresses with passionate ardor, with the ecstasy of a lover who suddenlymeets with a burst of tenderness on the part of the woman he has tenderlyloved, and whom he expects never to fold again in his arms.  Hecompletely lost his self-control.  His embrace became so ardent thatReine, alarmed at the sudden outburst, was overcome with shame andterror, notwithstanding the thought that the man, who was clasping her inhis arms with such passion, was her own brother.She tore herself away from him and pushed him violently back."Adieu!"  she cried, retreating to the kitchen, of which she hastily shutthe door.Claudet stood one moment, dumfounded, before the door so pitilessly shutin his face, then, falling suddenly from his happy state of illusion tothe dead level of reality, departed precipitately down the road.When he turned to give a parting glance, the farm buildings were nolonger visible, and the waste lands of the forest border, gray, stony,and barren, stretched their mute expanse before him."No!"  exclaimed he, between his set teeth, "she never loved me.  Shethinks only of the other man!  I have nothing more to do but go away andnever return!"CHAPTER IXLOVE HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTIn arriving at Langres, Claudet enrolled in the seventeenth battalion oflight infantry.  Five days later, paying no attention to the lamentationsof Manette, he left Vivey, going, by way of Lyon, to the camp atLathonay, where his battalion was stationed.  Julien was thus left aloneat the chateau to recover as best he might from the dazed feeling causedby the startling events of the last few weeks.  After Claudet'sdeparture, he felt an uneasy sensation of discomfort, and as if hehimself had lessened in value.  He had never before realized how littlespace he occupied in his own dwelling, and how much living heat Claudethad infused into the house which was now so cold and empty.  He felt poorand diminished in spirit, and was ashamed of being so useless to himselfand to others.  He had before him a prospect of new duties, whichfrightened him.  The management of the district, which Claudet hadundertaken for him, would now fall entirely on his shoulders, and just atthe time of the timber sales and the renewal of the fences.  Besides allthis, he had Manette on his conscience, thinking he ought to try tosoften her grief at her son's unexpected departure.  The ancienthousekeeper was like Rachel, she refused to be comforted, and her temperwas not improved by her recent trials.  She filled the air withlamentations, and seemed to consider Julien responsible for her troubles.The latter treated her with wonderful patience and indulgence, andexhausted his ingenuity to make her time pass more pleasantly.  This wasthe first real effort he had made to subdue his dislikes and his passivetendencies, and it had the good effect of preparing him, by degrees, toface more serious trials, and to take the initiative in matters ofgreater importance.  He discovered that the energy he expended inconquering a first difficulty gave him more ability to conquer thesecond, and from that result he decided that the will is like a muscle,which shrivels in inaction and is developed by exercise; and he made uphis mind to attack courageously the work before him, although it hadformerly appeared beyond his capabilities.He now rose always at daybreak.  Gaitered like a huntsman, and escortedby Montagnard, who had taken a great liking to him, he would proceed tothe forest, visit the cuttings, hire fresh workmen, familiarize himselfwith the woodsmen, interest himself in their labors, their joys and theirsorrows; then, when evening came, he was quite astonished to find himselfless weary, less isolated, and eating with considerable appetite thesupper prepared for him by Manette.  Since he had been traversing theforest, not as a stranger or a person of leisure, but with thepredetermination to accomplish some useful work, he had learned toappreciate its beauties.  The charms of nature and the living creaturesaround no longer inspired him with the defiant scorn which he had imbibedfrom his early solitary life and his priestly education; he now viewedthem with pleasure and interest.  In proportion, as his sympathiesexpanded and his mind became more virile, the exterior world presented amore attractive appearance to him.While this work of transformation was going on within him, he was aidedand sustained by the ever dear and ever present image of Reine Vincart.The trenches, filled with dead leaves, the rows of beech-trees, strippedof their foliage by the rude breath of winter, the odor peculiar tounderwood during the dead season, all recalled to his mind theimpressions he had received while in company with the woodland queen.Now that, he could better understand the young girl's adoration of themarvellous forest world, he sought out, with loving interest, the siteswhere she had gone into ecstasy, the details of the landscape which shehad pointed out to him the year before, and had made him admire.The beauty of the scene was associated in his thoughts with Reine's love,and he could not think of either separately.  But, notwithstanding thesteadfastness and force of his love, he had not yet made any effort tosee Mademoiselle Vincart.  At first, the increase of occupation caused byClaudet's departure, the new duties devolving upon him, together with hisinexperience, had prevented Julien from entertaining the possibility ofrenewing relations that had been so violently sundered.  Little bylittle, however; as he reviewed the situation of affairs, which hiscousin's generous sacrifice had engendered, he began to consider howhe could benefit thereby.  Claudet's departure had left the field free,but Julien felt no more confidence in himself than before.  The fact thatReine had so unaccountably refused to marry the grand chasserot did notseem to him sufficient encouragement.  Her motive was a secret, andtherefore, of doubtful interpretation.  Besides, even if she wereentirely heart-whole, was that a reason why she should give Julien afavorable reception?  Could she forget the cruel insult to which he hadsubjected her?  And immediately after that outrageous behavior of his,he had had the stupidity to make a proposal for Claudet.  That was thekind of affront, thought he, that a woman does not easily forgive,and the very idea of presenting himself before her made his heart sink.He had seen her only at a distance, at the Sunday mass, and every timehe had endeavored to catch her eye she had turned away her head.  Shealso avoided, in every way, any intercourse with the chateau.  Whenever aquestion arose, such as the apportionment of lands, or the allotment ofcuttings, which would necessitate her having recourse to M. de Buxieres,she would abstain from writing herself, and correspond only through thenotary, Arbillot.  Claudet's heroic departure, therefore, had reallyaccomplished nothing; everything was exactly at the same point as the dayafter Julien's unlucky visit to La Thuiliere, and the same futile doubtsand fears agitated him now as then.  It also occurred to him, that whilehe was thus debating and keeping silence, days, weeks, and months wereslipping away; that Reine would soon reach her twenty-third year, andthat she would be thinking of marriage.  It was well known that she hadsome fortune, and suitors were not lacking.  Even allowing that she hadno afterthought in renouncing Claudet, she could not always live alone atthe farm, and some day she would be compelled to accept a marriage ofconvenience, if not of love."And to think," he would say to himself, "that she is there, only a fewsteps away, that I am consumed with longing, that I have only to traversethose pastures, to throw myself at her feet, and that I positively darenot!  Miserable wretch that I am, it was last spring, while we were inthat but together, that I should have spoken of my love, instead ofterrifying her with my brutal caresses!  Now it is too late!  I havewounded and humiliated her; I have driven away Claudet, who would at anyrate have made her a stalwart lover, and I have made two beings unhappy,without counting myself.  So much for my miserable shufflings andevasion!  Ah! if one could only begin life over again!"While thus lamenting his fate, the march of time went steadily on, withits pitiless dropping out of seconds, minutes, and hours.  The worst partof winter was over; the March gales had dried up the forests; April wastingeing the woods with its tender green; the song of the cuckoo wasalready heard in the tufted bowers, and the festival of St. George hadpassed.Taking advantage of an unusually clear day, Julien went to visit a farm,belonging to him, in the plain of Anjeures, on the border of the forestof Maigrefontaine.  After breakfasting with the farmer, he took the wayhome through the woods, so that he might enjoy the first varied effectsof the season.The forest of Maigrefontaine, situated on the slope of a hill, was fullof rocky, broken ground, interspersed with deep ravines, along whichnarrow but rapid streams ran to swell the fishpond of La Thuiliere.Julien had wandered away from the road, into the thick of the forestwhere the budding vegetation was at its height, where the lilies multiplyand the early spring flowers disclose their umbelshaped clusters, full oftiny, white stars.  The sight of these blossoms, which had such a tendermeaning for him, since he had identified the name with that of Reine,brought vividly before him the beloved image of the young girl.He walked slowly and languidly on, heated by his feverish recollectionsand desires, tormented by useless self-reproach, and physicallyintoxicated by the balmy atmosphere and the odor of the flowering shrubsat his feet.  Arriving at the edge of a somewhat deep pit, he tried toleap across with a single bound, but, whether he made a false start, orthat he was weakened and dizzy with the conflicting emotions with whichhe had been battling, he missed his footing and fell, twisting his ankle,on the side of the embankment.  He rose with an effort and put his footto the ground, but a sharp pain obliged him to lean against the trunk ofa neighboring ash-tree.  His foot felt as heavy as lead, and every timehe tried to straighten it his sufferings were intolerable.  All he coulddo was to drag himself along from one tree to another until he reachedthe path.Exhausted by this effort; he sat down on the grass, unbuttoned hisgaiter, and carefully unlaced his boot.  His foot had swollenconsiderably.  He began to fear he had sprained it badly, and wonderedhow he could get back to Vivey.  Should he have to wait on this lonelyroad until some woodcutter passed, who would take him home?  Montagnard,his faithful companion, had seated himself in front of him, andcontemplated him with moist, troubled eyes, at the same time emittingshort, sharp whines, which seemed to say:"What is the matter?"  and, "How are we going to get out of this?"Suddenly he heard footsteps approaching.  He perceived a flutter of whiteskirts behind the copse, and just at the moment he was blessing the luckychance that had sent some one in that direction, his eyes were gladdenedwith a sight of the fair visage of Reine.She was accompanied by a little girl of the village, carrying a basketfull of primroses and freshly gathered ground ivy.  Reine was quitefamiliar with all the medicinal herbs of the country, and gathered themin their season, in order to administer them as required to the people ofthe farm.  When she was within a few feet of Julien, she recognized him,and her brow clouded over; but almost immediately she noticed his alteredfeatures and that one of his feet was shoeless, and divined thatsomething unusual had happened.  Going straight up to him, she said:"You seem to be suffering, Monsieur de Buxieres.  What is the matter?""A--a foolish accident," replied he, putting on a careless manner.  "Ifell and sprained my ankle."The young girl knit her brows with an anxious expression; then, after amoment's hesitation; she said:"Will you let me see your foot?  My mother understood about bone-setting,and I have been told that I inherit her gift of curing sprains."She drew from the basket an empty bottle and a handkerchief."Zelie," said she to the little damsel, who was standing astonished atthe colloquy, "go quickly down to the stream, and fill this bottle."While she was speaking, Julien, greatly embarrassed, obeyed hersuggestions, and uncovered his foot.  Reine, without any prudery ornonsense, raised the wounded limb, and felt around cautiously."I think," said she at last, "that the muscles are somewhat injured."Without another word, she tore the handkerchief into narrow strips, andpoured the contents of the bottle, which Zelie had filled, slowly overthe injure member, holding her hand high for that purpose.  Then, with asoft yet firm touch, she pressed the injured muscles into their places,while Julien bit his lips and did his very utmost to prevent her seeinghow much he was suffering.  After this massage treatment, the young girlbandaged the ankle tightly with the linen bands, and fastened themsecurely with pins."There," said she, "now try to put on your shoe and stocking; they willgive support to the muscles.  Now you, Zelie, run, fit to break yourneck, to the farm, make them harness the wagon, and tell them to bring ithere, as close to the path as possible."The girl picked up her basket and started on a trot."Monsieur de Buxieres;" said Reine, "do you think you can walk as far asthe carriage road, by leaning on my arm?""Yes;" he replied, with a grateful glance which greatly embarrassedMademoiselle Vincart, "you have relieved me as if by a miracle.  I feelmuch better and as if I could go anywhere you might lead, while leaningon your arm!"She helped him to rise, and he took a few steps with her aid."Why, it feels really better," sighed he.He was so happy in feeling himself thus tenderly supported by Reine, thathe altogether forgot his pain."Let us walk slowly," continued she, "and do not be afraid to lean on me.All you have to think of is reaching the carriage.""How good you are," stammered he, "and how ashamed I am!""Ashamed of what?"  returned Reine, hastily.  "I have done nothingextraordinary; anyone else would have acted in the same manner.""I entreat you," replied he, earnestly, "not to spoil my happiness.I know very well that the first person who happened to pass would haverendered me some charitable assistance; but the thought that it is you--you alone--who have helped me, fills me with delight, at: the same timethat it increases my remorse.  I so little deserve that you shouldinterest yourself in my behalf!"He waited, hoping perhaps that she would ask for an explanation, but,seeing that she did not appear to understand, he added:"I have offended you.  I have misunderstood you, and I have been cruellypunished for my mistake.  But what avails my tardy regret in healing theinjuries I have inflicted!  Ah! if one could only go backward, andefface, with a single stroke, the hours in which one has been blindand headstrong!""Let us not speak of that!"  replied she, shortly, but in a singularlysoftened tone.In spite of herself, she was touched by this expression of repentance,so naively acknowledged in broken, disconnected sentences, vibrating withthe ring of true sincerity.  In proportion as he abased himself, heranger diminished, and she recognized that she loved him just the same,notwithstanding his defects, his weakness, and his want of tact andpolish.  She was also profoundly touched by his revealing to her, for thefirst time, a portion of his hidden feelings.They had become silent again, but they felt nearer to each other thanever before; their secret thoughts seemed to be transmitted to eachother; a mute understanding was established between them.  She lent himthe support of her arm with more freedom, and the young man seemed toexperience fresh delight in her firm and sympathetic assistance.Progressing slowly, although more quickly than they would have chosenthemselves, they reached the foot of the path, and perceived the wagonwaiting on the beaten road.  Julien mounted therein with the aid of Reineand the driver.  When he was stretched on the straw, which had beenspread for him on the bottom of the wagon, he leaned forward on the side,and his eyes met those of Reine.  For a few moments their gaze seemedriveted upon each other, and their mutual understanding was complete.These few, brief moments contained a whole confession of love; avowalsmingled with repentance, promises of pardon, tender reconciliation!"Thanks!"  he sighed at last, "will you give me your hand?"She gave it, and while he held it in his own, Reine turned toward thedriver on the seat."Felix," said she, warningly, "drive slowly and avoid the ruts.  Good-night, Monsieur de Buxieres, send for the doctor as soon as you get in,and all will be well.  I will send to inquire how you are getting along."She turned and went pensively down the road to La Thuiliere, while thecarriage followed slowly the direction to Vivey.The doctor, being sent for immediately on Julien's arrival, pronounced ita simple sprain, and declared that the preliminary treatment had beenvery skilfully applied, that the patient had now only to keep perfectlystill.  Two days later came La Guite from Reine, to inquire after M. deBuxieres's health.  She brought a large bunch of lilies whichMademoiselle Vincart had sent to the patient, to console him for notbeing able to go in the woods, which Julien kept for several days closeby his side.This accident, happening at Maigrefontaine, and providentially attendedto by Reine Vincart, the return to the chateau in the vehicle belongingto La Thuiliere, the sending of the lilies, were all a source of greatmystification to Manette.  She suspected some amorous mystery in allthese events, commented somewhat uncharitably on every minor detail, andtook care to carry her comments all over the village.  Very soon theentire parish, from the most insignificant woodchopper to the Abbe Pernothimself, were made aware that there was something going on between M. deBuxieres and the daughter of old M. Vincart.In the mean time, Julien, quite unconscious that his love for Reine wasproviding conversation for all the gossips of the country, was cursingthe untoward event that kept him stretched in his invalid-chair.  Atlast, one day, he discovered he could put his foot down and walk a littlewith the assistance of his cane; a few days after, the doctor gave himpermission to go out of doors.  His first visit was to La Thuiliere.He went there in the afternoon and found Reine in the kitchen, seated bythe side of her paralytic father, who was asleep.  She was reading anewspaper, which she retained in her hand, while rising to receive hervisitor.  After she had congratulated him on his recovery, and he hadexpressed his cordial thanks for her timely aid, she showed him thepaper."You find me in a state of disturbance," said she, with a slight degreeof embarrassment, "it seems that we are going to have war and that ourtroops have entered Italy.  Have you any news of Claudet?"Julien started.  This was the last remark he could have expected.Claudet's name had not been once mentioned in their interview atMaigrefontaine, and he had nursed the hope that Reine thought no longerabout him.All his mistrust returned in a moment on hearing this name come from theyoung girl's lips the moment he entered the house, and seeing the emotionwhich the news in the paper had caused her."He wrote me a few days ago," replied he."Where is he?""In Italy, with his battalion, which is a part of the first army corps.His last letter is dated from Alexandria."Reine's eyes suddenly filled with tears, and she gazed absently at thedistant wooded horizon."Poor Claudet!"  murmured she, sighing, "what is he doing just now, Iwonder?""Ah!"  thought Julien, his visage darkening, "perhaps she loves himstill!"Poor Claudet!  At the very time they are thus talking about him at thefarm, he is camping with his battalion near Voghera, on the banks of oneof the obscure tributaries of the river Po, in a country rich in wavingcorn, interspersed with bounteous orchards and hardy vines climbing up tothe very tops of the mulberry-trees.  His battalion forms the extreme endof the advance guard, and at the approach of night, Claudet is on duty onthe banks of the stream.  It is a lovely May night, irradiated bymillions of stars, which, under the limpid Italian sky, appear larger andnearer to the watcher than they appeared in the vaporous atmosphere ofthe Haute-Marne.Nightingales are calling to one another among the trees of the orchard,and the entire landscape seems imbued with their amorous music.  Whatecstasy to listen to them!  What serenity their liquid harmonies spreadover the smiling landscape, faintly revealing its beauties in the mildstarlight.Who would think that preparations for deadly combat were going on throughthe serenity of such a night?  Occasionally a sharp exchange of musketrywith the advanced post of the enemy bursts upon the ear, and all thenightingales keep silence.  Then, when quiet is restored in the upperair, the chorus of spring songsters begins again.  Claudet leans on hisgun, and remembers that at this same hour the nightingales in the park atVivey, and in the garden of La Thuiliere, are pouring forth the samemelodies.  He recalls the bright vision of Reine: he sees her leaning ather window, listening to the same amorous song issuing from the coppicewoods of Maigrefontaine.  His heart swells within him, and an over-powering homesickness takes possession of him.  But the next moment he isashamed of his weakness, he remembers his responsibility, primes his ear,and begins investigating the dark hollows and rising hillocks where anenemy might hide.The next morning, May 20th, he is awakened by a general hubbub and noiseof fighting.  The battalion to which he belongs has made an attack uponMontebello, and is sending its sharpshooters among the cornfields andvineyards.  Some of the regiments invade the rice-fields, climb the wallsof the vineyards, and charge the enemy's column-ranks.  The sullen roarof the cannon alternates with the sharp report of guns, and whole showersof grape-shot beat the air with their piercing whistle.  All through theuproar of guns and thunder of the artillery, you can distinguish theguttural hurrahs of the Austrians, and the broken oaths of the Frenchtroopers.  The trenches are piled with dead bodies, the trumpets soundthe attack, the survivors, obeying an irresistible impulse, spring to thefront.  The ridges are crested with human masses swaying to and fro, andthe first red uniform is seen in the streets of Montebello, in reliefagainst the chalky facades bristling with Austrian guns, pouring forththeir ammunition on the enemy below.  The soldiers burst into the houses,the courtyards, the enclosures; every instant you hear the breaking openof doors, the crashing of windows, and the scuffling of the terrifiedinmates.  The white uniforms retire in disorder.  The village belongs tothe French!  Not just yet, though.  From the last houses on the street,to the entrance of the cemetery, is rising ground, and just behind standsa small hillock.  The enemy has retrenched itself there, and, from itscannons ranged in battery, is raining a terrible shower on the villagejust evacuated.The assailants hesitate, and draw back before this hailstorm of iron;suddenly a general appears from under the walls of a building alreadycrumbling under the continuous fire, spurs his horse forward, and shouts:"Come, boys, let us carry the fort!"Among the first to rally to this call, one rifleman in particular, afine, broad-shouldered active fellow, with a brown moustache and olivecomplexion, darts forward to the point indicated.  It is Claudet.Others are behind him, and soon more than a hundred men, with theirbayonets, are hurling themselves along the cemetery road; the grandchasserot leaps across the fields, as he used formerly in pursuit of thegame in the Charbonniere forest.  The soldiers are falling right and leftof him, but he hardly sees them; he continues pressing forward,breathless, excited, scarcely stopping to think.  As he is crossing oneof the meadows, however, he notices the profusion of scarlet gladiolusand also observes that the rye and barley grow somewhat sturdier herethan in his country; these are the only definite ideas that detachthemselves clearly from his seething brain.  The wall of the cemetery isscaled; they are fighting now in the ditches, killing one another on theside of the hill; at last, the fort is taken and they begin routing theenemy.  But, at this moment, Claudet stoops to pick up a cartridge, aball strikes him in the forehead, and, without a sound, he drops to theground, among the noisome fennels which flourish in graveyards--he drops,thinking of the clock of his native village.                         ......................"I have sad news for you," said Julien to Reine, as he entered the gardenof La Thuiliere, one June afternoon.He had received official notice the evening before, through the mayor, ofthe decease of "Germain-Claudet Sejournant, volunteer in the seventeenthbattalion of light infantry, killed in an engagement with the enemy, May20, 1859."Reine was standing between two hedges of large peasant-roses.  At thefirst words that fell from M. de Buxieres's lips, she felt a presentimentof misfortune."Claudet?"  murmured she."He is dead," replied Julien, almost inaudibly, "he fought bravely andwas killed at Montebello."The young girl remained motionless, and for a moment de Buxieres thoughtshe would be able to bear, with some degree of composure, thisannouncement of the death in a foreign country of a man whom she hadrefused as a husband.  Suddenly she turned aside, took two or threesteps, then leaning her head and folded arms on the trunk of an adjacenttree, she burst into a passion of tears.  The convulsive movement of hershoulders and stifled sobs denoted the violence of her emotion.  M. deBuxieres, alarmed at this outbreak, which he thought exaggerated, felt areturn of his old misgivings.  He was jealous now of the dead man whomshe was so openly lamenting.  Her continued weeping annoyed him; he triedto arrest her tears by addressing some consolatory remarks to her; but,at the very first word, she turned away, mounted precipitately thekitchen-stairs, and disappeared, closing the door behind her.  Someminutes after, La Guite brought a message to de Buxieres that Reinewished to be alone, and begged him to excuse her.He took his departure, disconcerted, downhearted, and ready to weephimself, over the crumbling of his hopes.  As he was nearing the firstoutlying houses of the village, he came across the Abbe Pernot, who wasstriding along at a great rate, toward the chateau."Ah!"  exclaimed the priest, "how are you, Monsieur de Buxieres, I wasjust going over to see you.  Is it true that you have received bad news?"Julien nodded his head affirmatively, and informed the cure of the sadnotice he had received.  The Abbe's countenance lengthened, his mouthtook on a saddened expression, and during the next few minutes hemaintained an attitude of condolence."Poor fellow!"  he sighed, with a slight nasal intonation, "he did nothave a fair chance!  To have to leave us at twenty-six years of age, andin full health, it is very hard.  And such a jolly companion; such aclever shot!"Finally, not being naturally of a melancholy turn of mind, nor able toremain long in a mournful mood, he consoled himself with one of the piouscommonplaces which he was in the habit of using for the benefit ofothers: "The Lord is just in all His dealings, and holy in all His works;He reckons the hairs of our heads, and our destinies are in His hands.We shall celebrate a fine high mass for the repose of Claudet's soul."He coughed, and raised his eyes toward Julien."I wished," continued he, "to see you for two reasons, Monsieur deBuxieres: first of all, to hear about Claudet, and secondly, to speak toyou on a matter--a very delicate matter--which concerns you, but whichalso affects the safety of another person and the dignity of the parish."Julien was gazing at him with a bewildered air.  The cure pushed open thelittle park gate, and passing through, added:"Let us go into your place; we shall be better able to talk over thematter."When they were underneath the trees, the Abbe resumed:"Monsieur de Buxieres, do you know that you are at this present timegiving occasion for the tongues of my parishioners to wag more than is atall reasonable?  Oh!"  continued he, replying to a remonstrating gestureof his companion, "it is unpremeditated on your part, I am sure, but, allthe same, they talk about you--and about Reine.""About Mademoiselle Vincart?"  exclaimed Julien, indignantly, "what canthey say about her?""A great many things which are displeasing to me.  They speak of yourhaving sprained your ankle while in the company of Reine Vincart; of yourreturn home in her wagon; of your frequent visits to La Thuiliere, and Idon't know what besides.  And as mankind, especially the female portion,is more disposed to discover evil than good, they say you arecompromising this young person.  Now, Reine is living, as one may say,alone and unprotected.  It behooves me, therefore, as her pastor,to defend her against her own weakness.  That is the reason why I havetaken upon myself to beg you to be more circumspect, and not trifle withher reputation.""Her reputation?"  repeated Julien, with irritation.  "I do notunderstand you, Monsieur le Cure!""You don't, hey!  Why, I explain my meaning pretty clearly.  Human beingsare weak; it is easy to injure a girl's reputation, when you try to makeyourself agreeable, knowing you can not marry her.""And why could I not marry her?"  inquired Julien, coloring deeply."Because she is not in your own class, and you would not love her enoughto overlook the disparity, if marriage became necessary.""What do you know about it?" returned Julien, with violence.  "I have nosuch foolish prejudices, and the obstacles would not come from my side.But, rest easy, Monsieur," continued he, bitterly, "the danger existsonly in the imagination of your parishioners.  Reine has never cared forme!  It was Claudet she loved!""Hm, hm!"  interjected the cure, dubiously."You would not doubt it," insisted de Buxieres, provoked at the Abbe'sincredulous movements of his head, "if you had seen her, as I saw her,melt into tears when I told her of Sejournant's death.  She did not evenwait until I had turned my back before she broke out in her lamentations.My presence was of very small account.  Ah!  she has but too cruelly mademe feel how little she cares for me!""You love her very much, then?"  demanded the Abbe, slyly, an almostimperceptible smile curving his lips."Oh, yes!  I love her," exclaimed he, impetuously; then coloring anddrooping his head.  "But it is very foolish of me to betray myself,since Reine cares nothing at all for me!"There was a moment of silence, during which the curb took a pinch ofsnuff from a tiny box of cherry wood."Monsieur de Buxieres;" said he, With a particularly oracular air,"Claudet is dead, and the dead, like the absent, are always in the wrong.But who is to say whether you are not mistaken concerning the nature ofReine's unhappiness?  I will have that cleared up this very day.  Good-night; keep quiet and behave properly."Thereupon he took his departure, but, instead of returning to theparsonage, he directed his steps hurriedly toward La Thuiliere.Notwithstanding a vigorous opposition from La Guite, he made use of hispastoral authority to penetrate into Reine's apartment, where he shuthimself up with her.  What he said to her never was divulged outside thesmall chamber where the interview took place.  He must, however, havefound words sufficiently eloquent to soften her grief, for when he hadgone away the young girl descended to the garden with a soothed althoughstill melancholy mien.  She remained a long time in meditation in thethicket of roses, but her meditations had evidently no bitterness inthem, and a miraculous serenity seemed to have spread itself over herheart like a beneficent balm.A few days afterward, during the unpleasant coolness of one of thosemornings, white with dew, which are the peculiar privilege of themountain-gorges in Langres, the bells of Vivey tolled for the dead,announcing the celebration of a mass in memory of Claudet.  The grandchasserot having been a universal favorite with every one in theneighborhood, the church was crowded.  The steep descent from the highplain overlooked the village.  They came thronging in through the woodedglens of Praslay; by the Auberive road and the forests of Charbonniere;companions in hunting and social amusements, foresters and wearers ofsabots, campers in the woods, inmates of the farms embedded in theforests--none failed to answer the call.  The rustic, white-walled navewas too narrow to contain them all, and the surplus flowed into thestreet.  Arbeltier, the village carpenter, had erected a rudimentarycatafalque, which was draped in black and bordered with wax tapers, andplaced in front of the altar steps.  On the pall, embroidered with silvertears, were arranged large bunches of wild flowers, sent from LaThuiliere, and spreading an aromatic odor of fresh verdure around.  TheAbbe Pernot, wearing his insignia of mourning, officiated.  Through theside windows were seen portions of the blue sky; the barking of the dogsand singing of birds were heard in the distance; and even while listeningto the 'Dies irae', the curb could not help thinking of the robust andbright young fellow who, only the year previous, had been so joyouslytraversing the woods, escorted by Charbonneau and Montagnard, and who wasnow lying in a foreign land, in the common pit of the little cemetery ofMontebello.As each verse of the funeral service was intoned, Manette Sejournant,prostrate on her prie-dieu, interrupted the monotonous chant withtumultuous sobs.  Her grief was noisy and unrestrained, but those presentsympathized more with the quiet though profound sorrow of Reine Vincart.The black dress of the young girl contrasted painfully with the deadpallor of her complexion.  She emitted no sighs, but, now and then, acontraction of the lips, a trembling of the hands testified to the inwardstruggle, and a single tear rolled slowly down her cheek.From the corner where he had chosen to stand alone, Julien de Buxieresobserved, with pain, the mute eloquence of her profound grief, and becameonce more a prey to the fiercest jealousy.  He could not help envying thefate of this deceased, who was mourned in so tender a fashion.  Again themystery of an attachment so evident and so tenacious, followed by sostrange a rupture, tormented his uneasy soul.  "She must have lovedClaudet, since she is in mourning for him," he kept repeating to himself,"and if she loved him, why this rupture, which she herself provoked, andwhich drove the unhappy man to despair?"At the close of the absolution, all the assistants defiled close besideJulien, who was now standing in front of the catafalque.  When it came toReine Vincart's turn, she reached out her hand to M. de Buxieres; at thesame time, she gazed at him with such friendly sadness, and infused intothe clasp of her hand something so cordial and intimate that the youngman's ideas were again completely upset.  He seemed to feel as if it werean encouragement to speak.  When the men and women had dispersed, and asurging of the crowd brought him nearer to Reine, he resolved to followher, without regard to the question of what people would say, or thecurious eyes that might be watching him.A happy chance came in his way.  Reine Vincart had gone home by the pathalong the outskirts of the wood and the park enclosure.  Julien wenthastily back to the chateau, crossed the gardens, and followed aninterior avenue, parallel to the exterior one, from which he wasseparated only by a curtain of linden and nut trees.  He could justdistinguish, between the leafy branches, Reine's black gown, as shewalked rapidly along under the ashtrees.  At the end of the enclosure,he pushed open a little gate, and came abruptly out on the forest path.On beholding him standing in advance of her, the young girl appeared moresurprised than displeased.  After a momentary hesitation, she walkedquietly toward him."Mademoiselle Reine," said he then, gently, "will you allow me toaccompany you as far as La Thuiliere?""Certainly," she replied, briefly.She felt a presentiment that something decisive was about to take placebetween her and Julien, and her voice trembled as she replied.  Profitingby the tacit permission, de Buxieres walked beside Reine; the path was sonarrow that their garments rustled against each other, yet he did notseem in haste to speak, and the silence was interrupted only by theoccasional flight of a bird, or the crackling of some falling branches."Reine," said Julien, suddenly, "you have so often and so kindly extendedto me the hand of friendship, that I have decided to speak frankly,and open my heart to you.  I love you, Reine, and have loved you for along time.  But I have been so accustomed to hide what I think, I know solittle how to conduct myself in the varying circumstances of life, and Ihave so much mistrust of myself, that I never have dared to tell youbefore now.  This will explain to you my stupid behavior.  I am sufferingthe penalty to-day, for while I was hesitating, another took my place;although he is dead, his shadow stands between us, and I know that youlove him still."She listened to him with bent head and half-closed eyes, and her heartbegan to beat violently."I never have loved him in the way you suppose," she replied, simply.A gleam of light shot through Julien's melancholy blue eyes.  Bothremained silent.  The green pasture-lands, bathed in the full noondaysun, were lying before them.  The grasshoppers were chirping in thebushes, and the skylarks were soaring aloft with their joyous songs.Julien was endeavoring to extract the exact meaning from the reply he hadjust heard.  He was partly reassured, but some points had still to becleared up."But still," said he, "you are lamenting his loss."A melancholy smile flitted for an instant over Reine's pure, rosy lips."Are you jealous of my tears?"  said she, softly."Oh, yes!"  he exclaimed, with sudden exultation, "I love you so entirelythat I can not help envying Claudet his share in your affections!  If hisdeath causes you such poignant regret, he must have been nearer anddearer to you than those that survive.""You might reasonably suppose otherwise," replied she, almost in awhisper, "since I refused to marry him."He shook his head, seemingly unable to accept that positive statement.Then Reine began to reflect that a man of his distrustful and despondenttemperament would, unless the whole truth were revealed to him,be forevermore tormented by morbid and injurious misgivings.  She knew heloved her, and she wished him to love her in entire faith and security.She recalled the last injunctions she had received from the Abbe Pernot,and, leaning toward Julien, with tearful eyes and cheeks burning withshame, she whispered in his ear the secret of her close relationship toClaudet.This painful and agitating confidence was made in so low a voice as to bescarcely distinguished from the soft humming of the insects, or thegentle twittering of the birds.The sun was shining everywhere; the woods were as full of verdure andblossoms as on the day when the young man had manifested his passion withsuch savage violence.  Hardly had the last words of her avowal expired onReine's lips, when Julien de Buxieres threw his arms around her andfondly kissed away the tears from her eyes.This time he was not repelled.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:Accustomed to hide what I thinkConsoled himself with one of the pious commonplacesHow small a space man occupies on the earthMore disposed to discover evil than goodNature's cold indifference to our sufferingsNever is perfect happiness our lotPlead the lie to get at the truthThe ease with which he is forgottenThose who have outlived their illusionsTimidity of a night-bird that is made to fly in the dayVexed, act in direct contradiction to their own wishesYou have considerable patience for a loverEnd of this Project Gutenberg Etext of A Woodland Queen, v3by Andre Theuriet
